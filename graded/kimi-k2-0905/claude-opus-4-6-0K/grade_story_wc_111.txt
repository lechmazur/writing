<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and conflicted: she both cherishes the maze and accepts the cost of lifelong deception; the ritual of polishing cracked marbles body-forths her need to transmute lies into beauty. The final shift—from lying to the hedges to recruiting them as co-authors of a “natural hybridization” claim—carries visible cost (she must surrender the purity myth she once forged). The only bar to 9+ is that the beat of public exposure (auditors tomorrow) is prospective; the actual moment of staking her reputation happens off-page, so the cost is announced rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as Charged Poise: the maze “rustles” its assent, reconfiguring forty years of deception into co-evolved truth. Orientation is swift (garden, dawn, post-report). Causality holds: each reflective block is tethered to a present-tense act (counting, polishing, whispering) that alters tactics. Cost is legible—“confession would destroy the maze”—and the final image crystallizes stakes without flinching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: cracked marbles, mossy path, yew walls filter every perception. The garden constrains choice—uprooting is fatal—so Elara must fabricate within its bounds. Sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency: visual fractures, tactile polish, hush of whispered collusion. One hairline slip: “geometry somehow shifted between surveys” is asserted, not shown or sensed, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the grafted maze—tightens once: from covert lying to overt reframing. Agency is present throughout (polishing, planning, confessing-to-hedges). Cost is announced rather than paid on-page, so pressure peaks at 8.4 rather than 8.8+. Coincidence (Bureau’s new metrics) complicates but does not resolve, preserving causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “mending”: marbles, grafts, lies, love—all cracked yet luminous. Final reweighting—“love had become indistinguishable from skill”—answers the core question without moralizing. Subtext breathes in gesture: polishing broken glass = sanctifying her own moral fractures. Ambiguity lingers: is the maze complicit or merely indifferent? Complexity upheld.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Free-indirect style sustains an aged, vine-dresser’s diction: “gnarled as old grape stock,” “mongrel paradise.” Rhythm flexes with pressure—long sentences for memory, staccato triads for threat. No dialogue, so voice carries all; perceptual signature is selective (light through cracked glass, rustle not wind). One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she had learned… she had forged… she had grafted”) is functional backstory, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and controlled; figurative layers serve image without crowding. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening line anchors stakes; closing line releases into charged poise. Occasional elevated diction (“provenance papers,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by bureaucratic threat. Momentum never stalls—every paragraph shifts knowledge or tactic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of horticultural fraud with probabilistic auditing feels fresh; transformation test fails if relocated to another craft. Marbles as lie-tallies, maze as co-author, love-as-skill reframing—all specific to this voice. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in tactile closure. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
