<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—she “turns the bishop’s chess piece over and over,” a tactile anchor of inherited skepticism. Contradictory impulses (order vs. chaos) are dramatized through her meticulous staging of “accidents,” not proclaimed. The final beat—holding breath as the nurse steps onto the sixth stair—crystallizes her stake: the cost of remaining invisible while forcing others to feel wonder. The renunciation of overt credit is earned, but the absence of a visible price on her own body caps this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nurse’s footfall triggers the spectrum and whale-note, reconfiguring routine into wonder while Maren stays unseen. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each micro-installation thickens texture until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in Maren’s self-erasure; she forfeits being the recognized agent of awe. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors are clean by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is not backdrop but sequencer: retreating water exposes the sixth stair exactly when Betelgeuse must frame it, constraining Maren’s timing. The bishop on the bottom step is micro-setting that orients every subsequent angle; its carved mitre catches starlight in the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s attention—silver ribbons, barely audible fishing-line hum—never tourist catalog. Environment + tool together charge the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interrupt strangers’ monotony—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the nurse approaches; one meaningful deepening suffices. Agency is Maren’s invisible choreography; the cost is her own invisibility, felt as the nurse experiences “something beautiful that felt entirely like accident.” No external antagonist needed; coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Escalation is textural—each added prism, line, note thickens pressure until the spectrum breaks—meeting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: bishop = denial of inherited order; prisms = chaos refracted into wonder. Final image reweights the premise—serendipity can be engineered, but the engineer must vanish. No moralizing; the whale-song D-sharp is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is Maren’s artistry generosity or addiction? Complexity held without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “lightly attentive, the way a cat tracks a moth it has no intention of catching.” Syntax mirrors Maren’s angled thinking—long, hypotactic sentences for calculation; fragment bursts for sensor triggers (“The tide licked the stones.”). No head-hopping; distance remains close third. Compression in “calculated wilderness” is taught early and paid off in the feral yet measured climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: caesuras inside architectural descriptions, then staccato beats as sensors trip. Information density high—one sentence often layers time, star angle, and emotional motive (“The third arch would frame Betelgeuse at twelve forty-seven.”). Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. “Cathedral with no ceiling” risks purple but is earned by later reversal into open sky. Closing line is clean propulsion into resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—street performer who stages coincidences via tidal astronomy—feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Bishop-as-compass, whale-song frequency, star-prism timing synthesize into singular artistic stance. Risk taken: almost no dialogue, climax seen only through light and sound, yet stakes remain intimate. Transformation test fails if Maren is swapped out—her specific calculus of wonder is irreplaceable.</comment>
