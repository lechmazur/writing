<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesper’s ache to share non-violent light is embodied in every micro-gesture (thumb on the gear, chest-ping) and drives the final seeding choice; the generational fatalism is shown, not told, through the gear’s bite and the repeated refusal to abandon the garden. Interior contradiction—tenderness for what destroys—remains vivid and unresolved, earning the quiet renunciation. No other characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Vesper drifts toward the dark pocket carrying the accumulated glow of “ten thousand gentle deaths,” a conceptual repricing that makes the infinite calculation personal and costly. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each petal-fall and ping adds density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when taught by line 3). No causality breaks; the unfinished gear computation persists as constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden is not backdrop but instrument: petal-residual heat replaces stellar fire, constraining Vesper’s tactics and enabling the non-violent illumination she seeks. Sonar navigation is tactile—chest-resonance, echo-map—making the cosmos a lived body. The gear’s bronze teeth against her pulse serve as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless across the drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens when she confronts the “pocket of darkness” and chooses to seed it with after-glow rather than new stars; this narrows her options from curation to active creation. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: each petal’s fall reminds her of the violence she refuses. Cost is the inherited ache and the knowledge the calculation will never finish; the price is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of pure gift—light always carries extinct star violence—yet the choice to transmit only after-glow reconfigures the moral math without moralizing. The gear’s unfinished decimals echo the ethical asymptote: approach forever. Final image of seeding darkness with spent radiance offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “sonar pinging,” “ionized cathedral columns,” precise yet mournful. Syntax lengthens and breathes with nebular scale; diction stays within Vesper’s perceptual lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Compression (“time measured across the quiet sigh”) is taught early and paid off in final petal-fall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long nebular sentences to clipped gear-bite fragments; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—petals as memory, garden as computation—without purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif seamlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “star-petal gardener who navigates by sonar to give away after-glow” is a singular synthesis; no genre template matches it. The unfinished infinity gear repurposes steampunk relic into cosmic elegy. Risk—quiet lyric refusal of fire—pays off in the final seeding. Transformation test fails if names or places swapped; the concept is irreducibly specific.</comment>
