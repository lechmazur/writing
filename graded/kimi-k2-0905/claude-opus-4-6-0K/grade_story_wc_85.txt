<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory reflex to “curate the past into something bearable” yet now refuse to do so gives her a charged, credible interior schism; the embodied moment pressing palm to notebook shows cost without therapy-speak. Motivation scales cleanly from trade guilt to personal stake. The sister-as-absence drives every beat; no stock labels, only specific acts (ink, watch hand, notebook). Still, the final renunciation is mostly declared (“she would stop sieving the hush”) rather than dramatized in a last micro-choice, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the notebook entry reweights the premise, the tide image holds undeniable conceptual cost, and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout. Causality is intact—each artifact (watch hand, pelican certificate, driftwood initials) tightens knowledge. Orientation is secure by line 30. The single paragraph of overt self-explanation (“mercy has a half-life…”) is the lone softening; it slows rather than breaks the ascent to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, watch hand, salt-bleached wood, and tide function as micro-settings that physically constrain access and supply evidence; the terrace edge literally forces her to hold the objects or let them fall. Selective sensory tightness—“salt-bleached,” “thin blade of gold”—mirrors Maren’s archival precision. No set-dressing extras; every detail either dates the carving or indexes forgery technique. Needed for 9+: one beat where the setting actively jeopardizes the search (slippery stone, failing light) is only implied, not staged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the sister or her absence—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpens through each reclaimed carving. Pressure escalates by density pattern: each new initial set narrows possibility space until the forged birth certificate collapses her professional confidence. No coincidence; the 4:17 watch hand is father-caused, not luck. Cost is visible—she forfeits her former soothing craft by writing the unvarnished name—meeting the 8.8 gate, though the beat is singular rather than compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of her own method: the ethics of “sieving hush” invert when the hush is her kin. Subtext lives in objects—abstract driftwood figures are unread portraits until she re-weights them. Final image of letting “silence speak” reframes the entire opening metaphor without moralizing. Complexity is honored: she neither forgives herself nor guarantees reunion; the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-close distance is rock-steady; perceptual signature filtered through archival eyes—“tagged with initials,” “archival ink,” “she knew every technique”—keeps lexicon precise and profession-bound. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences build sediment, then the final paragraph clips to present-tense resolve. No dialogue, so no contamination risk. One tiny filter-stack (“she realized now”) is forgivable and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative control is high: bruised sea, salt-bleached wood, gravity of silence—all unified by tide-and-time motif. Information density strong; single sentences perform triple duty (e.g., watch hand throws gold / reveals time / triggers memory). No loops or mixed metaphors. The single “tempered regret settled into her bones” skirts cliché but is rescued by preceding concrete weight of notebook; still, it blocks 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: genealogical forger forced to reverse-engineer her own erasure. Driftwood carvings as unread portraiture, cobalt terrace as archival limbo, and “sieved hush” as technical term all feel specific to this storyworld. Risk in withholding sister until late pays off because the closure reconfigures the father’s art. Not a trope inversion I’ve seen executed in this form; stakes stay human-sized yet conceptually vast.</comment>
