<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ren’s interiority is concrete—“she let it shake without correcting”—and her appraisal habit reframes trauma as fieldwork, a fresh lens. The father’s confession is the only external pressure; she never confronts him on-page, so the relational crucible is implicit, not dramatized. Still, her micro-choice to turn the seized valve and then stand in darkness earns stasis with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for single-POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (radio static, calcium reek, bead click) deepens the density of inherited guilt rather than advancing causal plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—“she stood in the dark … appraising the silence”—where the weight is reconfigured from measurable to carried; cost is legible in the deliberate surrender of light. The pattern is taught early and holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>The tunnel’s calcium stink and seized valve wheel function as micro-setting that literally halts her motion, charging the final image. Sensory selection mirrors POV bias—AM psychic chatter kept low “to feel drowsy, high enough to stay sharp.” Spatial choreography is clean; body-to-pipe distance tracked as she photographs and writes. Environment constrains the last beat (darkness forced by switching lamp off), clearing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—tightens when the beaded valve refuses to turn, escalating from search to embodied burden. The irreversible act is choosing darkness: appraisal renounces data for silence, foreclosing measurement. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the “small percussion decay into silence” that replaces radio static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refrains of silence: thirty-six years of it, refrigerator hum, tunnel hiss, final dark. The beaded memorial reweights appraisal from empirical to ritual knowledge without moralizing. No thematic echo articulates the thesis; the closing image lets silence repricing land obliquely, inviting counter-readings about complicity and inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a forensic coolness—“clinical, precise — the only language she trusted”—that fractures under tremoring hand, showing psychic distance shift. Prose rhythms mimic breath: long sentences in transit, clipped fragments at valve. Perceptual signature is skeptical-materialist, noticing electrical surges and calcium salts before metaphors. No head-hopping; radio callers remain external texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “beads clicked softly … sound like rosary stones” collapses sensory and symbolic work in one line. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and accurate. Sentence variety propels the accumulative build without drumbeat. Copy is clean; only minor filter verb “she could hear” is voice-motivated to stress distance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of industrial-explorer subculture with inherited guilt over an undocumented ghost shift feels non-obvious and site-specific. Appraisal-through-radio-psychics is a fresh methodological quirk that doubles as thematic commentary on narrative fabrication. The seized beaded valve as secular reliquary reconfigures standard ruin-porn imagery. Risk in quiet, anti-epiphany ending pays off by crystallizing weight rather than releasing it.</comment>
