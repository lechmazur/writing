<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s translator gift is vividly embodied—pressing the lens to the canvas makes the names blaze—but her interior contradiction is told, not shown (“half here, half somewhere else”). The final act of carrying the painting away is credible, yet the moment of private cost is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the arc just shy of full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: lens fragment → painting → revealed names → archival vow, each step because/therefore. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Maren lifts the painting with the market swaying, the perpetual suspension itself the price she accepts. The only drag is a 141-word backstory block before spatial anchor is complete, nudging the Orientation Test penalty; still, the disorientation ultimately feeds the closure image, so the deduction stays at −0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sky-borne alchemist market is rendered through tactile specifics—“pigments ground from stones that no longer existed”—and the lighthouse beam painted with hidden names becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Maren’s translator bias; every detail refracts through her lens-guided perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early: recover the erased names or they stay lost. The midpoint tightening—Oxanna steps aside, Maren must decide in front of the merchant crowd—narrows options and carries visible social risk. Cost is legible but not yet viscerally felt; the tightening is present yet modest for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of restored memory emerges through the specific act of lifting painted names into public record, not exposition. The final swaying market image reweights earlier motifs—paintings, lenses, sky-anchors—into a quiet but undeniable conceptual repricing: history stays airborne only if someone keeps holding it aloft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual idiom—“the world contained hidden channels, and she could feel them the way other people felt changes in weather.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive without calling attention to itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—description plus causality. One mixed metaphor (“sentence between two languages”) appears in the final image but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with the swaying market.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rooftop alchemical bazaar that exists only in grandmother-encoded paintings feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Combining art restoration, inter-world translation, and archival justice synthesizes familiar elements into a singular mythos; the lens fragment as cipher key is a risk that pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
