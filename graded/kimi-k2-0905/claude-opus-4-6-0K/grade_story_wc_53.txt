<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm to her forehead to “hold the timeline in place” is a perfect micro-gesture of temporal vertigo. The contradictory impulse to both hoard and jettison ambition is dramatized, not summarized, and the final stance—asking the younger ghost “what’s worth wanting now”—carries visible cost. The scavenger reflex is consistent, yet the story withholds one beat that would show her actually altering tactics under pressure; she listens and questions but does not yet refuse or reach. Still, the earned contradiction between versions of self is strong enough for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mosaic of time-shards teaches its pattern early (“time folded in on itself”) and lands a clean Charged Poise: the ghost’s single audible click reweights every fragment Maren carries. Causality is lyric rather than linear—each object’s whisper is a because/therefore that funnels to the final question. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately slack, but the slack is taught and payoff-off at closure, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. Cost is unmistakable: the carousel silence plus the ghost’s answer foreclose the old ambition path without restoring a new one.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds is not backdrop but active logic: the decelerating carousel creates the stillness that allows fragment-harvesting, and the cloud-salt corrosion literalizes eroded ambition. Micro-setting inside the salvage bag—the thumbscrew, ticket stub—functions as mobile terrain that constrains next moves. Sensory economy is tight: “mist curled upward from a world she could no longer see below” locates altitude and emotional vertigo in one breath. Final image of the ghost turning the wheel on the stone charges both object and landscape simultaneously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what’s worth wanting now”—is signaled by the second paragraph and tightens through each recovered fragment that retroactively deletes an ambition. The carousel halt is the external pressure event; each whispered story is an internal escalation that narrows Maren’s options from photographer → survivor → interrogator of her own ghost. No false reversals; the only “turn” is the ghost’s final click, which crystallizes rather than resolves tension. Cost is conceptual but legible: the old camera wheel repurposed as interrogation tool means the ambition medium is now only evidence, no longer instrument.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulate of overheard regrets rather than from authorial thesis: ambition is not lost but transmuted into narrative silt that can be re-mined for future desire. The final question—“what’s worth wanting now”—refuses both nostalgia and amnesia, leaving a resonant ambiguity that feels earned. Subtext lives in gesture: the ghost’s lack of accusation versus Maren’s defensive apology-in-denial. No moral is stated; the reader is left holding the exposed film of someone else’s unmade images, invited to re-price desire itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Maren’s perceptual signature: “fractured stillness,” “kinetic pulses,” “cloud-salt” are coinages that feel native to a scavenger-poet. Syntax compresses under pressure—“the regret hit her sideways”—and widens for the lyrical list of fragments. No head-hopping; the ghost is observed only externally, maintaining epistemic modesty. Rhythm accelerates into near-fragmentation during the list of artifacts, then slows to single-sentence paragraphs for the final negotiation, mirroring the decelerating carousel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: the first sentence delivers day, machine, and emotional state. Figurative language is selective—“memories of motion, small kinetic pulses”—and never stacks into purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either lagoon physics or Maren’s stance. One near-miss: “peace was too whole a word for what remained” flirts with abstraction, but the immediate correction (“fractured stillness”) keeps it grounded. Final line’s monosyllabic cadence—“laid the cards face-up in an order she could almost, almost, read”—earns its stutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The carousel-above-clouds as aging dream-engine is fresh, yet instantly legible. Turning a disposable camera’s thumbscrew into a listening device literalizes “overheard stories” in a way that feels inevitable, not clever-for-its-own-sake. Temporal scavenging as plot method fuses character, world, and theme: the same gesture that harvests metal harvests memory. Risk—non-linear, lyric structure—heightens rather than obscures stakes because the pattern is taught early and the final click gives a tactile payoff.</comment>
