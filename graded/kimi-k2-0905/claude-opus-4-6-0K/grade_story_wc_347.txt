<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s reluctant duty, exactitude, and curse-workaround are shown through concrete micro-choices (wrapped pry-bar, booted kicks, singing to birds). The nut-planning ritual and final renunciation of direct touch crystallize a costed stance. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where she both wants to flee and stay—keeping her just shy of 9-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: blueprint discovery → because frost threatens → therefore Maren assembles untouched passage → families live. Closure is a Charged Poise: the nut sits on the blueprint as visible cost of inherited vigilance. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no teleporting props or luck; every beat tightens options under frost-clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Limestone orchard, brass birds, black sap, mineral stair-scent—each detail is filtered through Maren’s tool-focused gaze and steers action (birds’ light beams, sap’s curse dictating no-touch). The harbor salt-slap reprises the cliff’s verticality, reweighting the passage’s graceless utility. Micro-setting (nut, wrapped pry-bar) constrains tactics; no tourist catalog; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—get three families down before frost—locks early and escalates via frost-cold exhales, birds tucking wings, silver-lethal switchbacks. One meaningful tightening: rubble-blocked lower route becomes only viable path. Protagonist agency drives every shift; cost is felt in frozen sweat, lantern fuel spent, and the nut’s final stillness. No coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited obligation versus individual agency emerges through images—grandmother’s key, counting nut, untouched labor—never named. Final nut-on-blueprint image reweights “graceless beauty” as sufficient salvation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers: orchard still cursed, Maren still bound. Subtext in mechanical birds’ tilted heads and sap’s brittleness enriches without stating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual signature: distances measured by eye, tools weighed, songs pitched to brass birds. Syntax is spare, exact, mirroring her offhand precision. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her lexicon (“seventeen meters,” “wire handles”). Rhythm accelerates during rubble work, then slows for harbor exhale—intentional cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density: “salt air hit her face like a slap of grace” does three jobs (sense, metaphor, thematic reprise). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “she could feel it in the way…” repeats thrice but serves frost countdown; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sideways orchard, mechanical birds, and no-touch curse combine into a fresh pressure system; blueprint-of-sealed-staircase twist feels inevitable yet unmined. Exactitude-as-character-trait and counting-nut ritual are specific inventions, not genre defaults. Risky vertical setting is fully exploited. Only withheld from 9.5 because the “frost deadline” is a familiar clock.</comment>
