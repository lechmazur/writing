<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and after-death perceptual gift are fused: dust-reading and “pressure changes” externalize grief and let her detect the ghost. The mainspring barrel becomes a tactile metaphor for her own stored tension; turning the key is a micro-choice that visibly costs—she feels ghost-fingers and the chest pressure eases—earning her promise to mail the letters. Interiority stays concrete (“heavy and weightless at once”) and profession-specific; no therapeutic self-labeling. One minor slip: the eleven-year résumé line is static exposition, but it does not undercut the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, the cracked barrel, and the fluorescent’s dying buzz layer density until the displaced ceiling tile breaks the pattern and triggers the final retrieval. Causality is present but subordinate—ghost’s gaze → tile → box—yet the closure’s cost is legible in the “lighter” pocket and the promise, a Charged Poise that reweights the tower she still must face. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no debt. One immaculate tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ticket booth’s dust strata, sun-cracked Plexiglas, and the single coughing tube are filtered through Maren’s elevator-tech gaze; spatial choreography holds as she steps onto the counter. The barrel’s cracked brass and the scarf-wrapped cigar box function as micro-setting objects that constrain her final choice—she must fit key to barrel before leaving. Weather is absent, but the dying fluorescent supplies a lived clock that thickens atmosphere. Detail never stalls momentum; every noun is also a tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: give the unseen mother a voice before demolition erases her. Pressure escalates once: the fluorescent dies → air thickens → ghost gaze forces tile investigation; Maren’s agency is the climb and the promise, which forecloses the option to walk away untouched. Cost is felt (chest pressure eases, pocket lighter). No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies the accumulative design. Ghost assistance complicates rather than resolves, keeping causality clean.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—buried tension eventually splits surfaces—emerges through the mainspring barrel, the pen-cracked custody letters, and Maren’s own cracked-after-death perception. No character states the thesis; the final image of the “lighter” barrel reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the un-mailed letters implies systemic silencing of working mothers; resonance lingers in the promise to post them. Ambiguity survives: we never learn if family remains, yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual signature: elevators as “cathedral naves,” dust as “quiet strata,” grief as “pressure changes.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens—“She picked up the elevator key”—to match the decision beat. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Fluorescent buzz dying off is both literal and rhythmic caesura, teaching the pattern that closure echoes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “dust never lied” does triple duty—character, world rule, theme. Metaphors (vertical rivers, wound mainspring) stay coherent and physics-loyal. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. One near-purple line—“crown of dead bulbs”—survives because it’s the only ornamental flare and occurs pre-escalation, not near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator repair, ghost-seeing via pressure shifts, and a circus-mother’s custody letters yields a synthesis that feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. The mainspring barrel as emotional Geiger counter is fresh without being gimmicky; risk is taken and paid off in the lighter pocket image. Specificity of 1971 family court paperwork anchors universality. No derivative echo of famous circus or ghost tropes; the story’s own logic drives every turn.</comment>
