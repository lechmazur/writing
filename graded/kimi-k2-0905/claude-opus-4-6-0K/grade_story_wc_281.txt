<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—skepticism toward Jonah’s pharma-world yet reliance on his framework—stays active in every beat; the decision to translate somatic markers into light is embodied, not declared. The final phone call crystallizes a credible renunciation of victimhood at visible cost: she volunteers herself as both test subject and doubter, foreclosing passive recovery. Micro-choices (thumb on geode, wand trajectory tied to chest-tightness) keep agency tactile. Missing only a sharper status jab from Jonah on the line to push her one notch further under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph reweights the withdrawal from damage to map, cost felt in “fragile, translucent hope.” Causal chain holds—pill recall → static shock → somatic overflow → light translation → invitation to co-study—each beat narrows her options toward collaboration. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“light painting studio smelled…”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the piece ends in Causal lens with persistent constraint: her body now the instrument she must calibrate.</comment>

<comment>Studio geography is lean but sufficient: cameras as sentinels, steel table, tethered monitor—each object is handled and constrains movement. The muscovite sliver doubles as micro-setting, its fractal planes steering the final image; light itself becomes navigable terrain. Sensory selection is POV-driven—ozone/lavender mix, retina ghost trails—never tourist catalog. One sentence drifts toward cataloguing (“long-exposure cameras stood like sentinels…”) but is saved by immediate kinesthetic use.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can the withdrawal be made legible and useful?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is single-cycle deepening: static shock raises cost of ignoring her body; light-painting converts threat into tool, foreclosing pure medical rescue. The tightening is protagonist-driven (she devises the method) and lands with visible price: she must offer herself to empirical scrutiny. No false coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges: the body’s unintelligible signals as latent cartography. No thesis states this; the photograph’s fractal light performs it. Subtext in Jonah’s off-page silence versus on-page “I’ll bring tea” encodes reconciliation without moral. Final image of “tuning fork still ringing” reweights earlier static into ongoing instrument—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. One clause flirts with echo-statement (“I think it’s a map”) but is immediately ironized by peer-review joke, keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren; perceptual signature is photographer—light trails, fractal recursion, shutter timing. Syntax lengthens under reflection, contracts during wand sweeps, mirroring attention shifts. No head-hopping; Jonah’s smile is heard, not interiorized. One near-slip—“your body is still reading”—channels his quoted diction safely within her paraphrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “fractally precise patterns that repeated at every scale” packs visual, tactile, and conceptual data. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the single optic/geode lattice. One scaffold phrase—“the pills stopped, but the sensitivity didn’t”—could compress, but momentum recovers in next sentence. Final paragraph’s anaphora (“still ringing, still mapping”) is earned cadence, not template.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-withdrawal repurposed as somatic cartography feels fresh; coupling it to light-painting turns a gimmick into personal instrument. Geode sliver’s mica planes repurposed as both tactile anchor and visual algorithm avoids stock crystal trope. Risk taken: climax is a photograph viewed on monitor, yet stakes stay visceral. Could push further if Jonah’s pharma guilt collided on-page, but within word limit the synthesis is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
