<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to scars as archive yet seeking release—play out in concrete beats: the trembling cup, the frozen hourglass, the final descent. Interiority stays anchored to sensory stimuli (coffee rings, oak hum). The choice to restart time is earned by the plant-telepathy beat that reframes erasure as translation, costing her the old tactile lexicon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: flipping the hourglass crystallizes the new stance that her history will bloom elsewhere. Causal chain intact—scars removed → grief → oak message → acceptance—with felt cost in the “brown moisture” she can no longer read. Hourglass set-up and payoff satisfy the lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Botanical garden, tower room, and coffee cup create a micro-setting that constrains choice: only from the height can she hear the oak, only the cup offers new “text.” Selective sensory filters (frosted glass, jasmine sweetness) mirror interior shift without cataloging. Spatial choreography is clean; the oak’s root-route to medical waste is implausible but reads as magical logic the piece earns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep her archive of pain—tightens once: surgery erases → plants promise reconstitution. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-accumulative, intensifying through sensory layering. The tightening narrows her options to acceptance; cost is the inability to touch her own past in human language.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transmutation emerges from image pattern: scars → compost → chlorophyll, coffee rings → tunnel → passage. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via particulate detail. Final image reweights the premise—loss becomes literal fertilizer—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a lyrical yet precise diction (“low green hum,” “bruised purple”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at tactile beats, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; plant dialogue is filtered through Maren’s sensory telepathy, staying inside her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density—each sentence advances image or emotional shift. Metaphors (“tunnel through earth,” “meteor-hush”) are few, purposeful, paid off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the sand’s rain-sound. Occasional elevated phrase (“displaced miracle”) fits reflective register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Telepathy-with-plants and medical-waste-to-bloom synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable given garden context. Coffee-ring divination refigures mundane remnant as legible text. Conceptual risk (organic reincarnation of excised scars) is fully committed to, not decorative.</comment>
