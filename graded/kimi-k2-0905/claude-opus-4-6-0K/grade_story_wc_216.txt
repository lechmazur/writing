<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and specific—her obsession with “the texture of time” is embodied in the way she handles the urn fragment and freezes the clock. Contradictory impulses (preservation vs. surrender to timelessness) coexist in the same beats. The final stance—renouncing measurement yet keeping the shard—earns its cost through prior causality and is scaled to the word count. No stock phrasing or label-speak; every emotional state is shown through tactile action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each listing becomes a bead in a rosary of recovered memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—the frozen clock and urn shard reconfigure meaning without declarative summation, and the cost (permanent exile from measurable time) is felt in the hush of the final sentence. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 30. The urn fragment’s weight in the palm is the persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s oxidized walls and curved workshop constrain movement and echo the capsule’s dented steel; every description is filtered through Maren’s restorer gaze. Light at dusk, the smell of rust, the tactile warmth of the urn shard—selective sensory hierarchy mirrors narrowing attention. The silo’s green surface reappears in the final line as the light that falls across the timeless objects, charging the closure image. No filler geography; every detail is reused and re-weighted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the Eliade meaning—tightens when each encoded listing forecloses the option of public archival preservation. The urn fragment’s physical break becomes the visible price paid for trusting future language. Escalation is textural: density of recovered listings increases until the only untouched node is the shard itself. Under Accumulative lens, the final silence in the silo is the meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without exposition: time is not a metric but a porous vessel that leaks identity. The motif of “broken container” migrates from capsule to urn to silo, each re-pricing the idea of safekeeping. Final image—light on shard and frozen clock—offers a non-literal answer: meaning survives only outside measurement. No thematic echo; the insight is left implicit in the tactile tableau.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature—clocks “no longer kept conventional time,” garages sales are “rarely monitored.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during contemplative beats, compresses into noun phrases when she codes listings. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she found,” “she began”) and disappear during peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Figurative language is sparse, precise: time “stretch like warm glass or shatter like ice.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “oxidation that had turned the silo green.” No mixed metaphors or register drift; every noun is concrete, every verb strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—math itself is redefined—takes the hoary “time capsule” trope and fractures it at the ontological level. Encoding family memory inside algorithmically ignored e-commerce text is a fresh, plausible inflection that could not be swapped for a letter or diary. Risk-taking (no dialogue, no antagonist, no conventional climax) heightens coherence because pressure is internal and conceptual. The transformation test fails: remove the Numeric Accord and the entire narrative evaporates.</comment>
