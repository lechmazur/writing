<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective drive vs. aurora-fed fatalism—play out in embodied beats: palm on barnacled glass, ash-slick fingers pressing memory into crystal. Her renunciation of certainty (“She did not know if it would work. She never did”) costs her the illusion of rescue and lands as Earned Stasis, fully paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sensory absence builds to the final crystalline imprint; the red-aurora moan reweights all prior silences. Closure unit is Charged Poise—options narrowed to “battered marvel,” cost felt in the father-bridge memory that will never exist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, cold-forge keel, and salt-apple branch constrain every beat; the driftwood-whalebone housing literally shapes the hearing aid that will touch the girl. Final image of aurora singing green recharges the barnacle-filtered dome, environment locking the cost in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“isolate the sound of trust breaking”—tightens once when red aurora moans the father memory; that single deepening reweights all prior absences and forecloses Elara’s detachment. Price is legible: she gifts away the exact frequency that still wounds her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “survivable rupture” emerges from crystallized absences, never named aloud; the final green aurora re-prices earlier silences as potentially renewable. No moral stated—only the battered marvel of holding damage up to light and letting it refract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person clings to Elara’s synesthetic bias—colors heard, forge-whispers in shades—without head-hop; syntax lengthens under aurora flare then fractures at the hinge-sigh wafer. Distinct perceptual signature holds through the final green song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative layers serve the accumulative lens—no mixed metaphors, no register drift—and the hinge-sigh sentence crystallizes the father absence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Hearing aids tuned to absence” is a fresh synthesis; sideways apple trees threading shipwrecks particularize the world. Risk-taking—cold forge fed by aurora—pays off in closure image rather than gimmick, making the marvel feel inevitable.</comment>
