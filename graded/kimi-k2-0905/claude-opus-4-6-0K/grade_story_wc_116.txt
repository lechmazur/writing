<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The keeper’s renunciation of judgment and language is embodied in every micro-gesture—unfolding the swan, letting the vine retreat—so her final exhalation costs the last tether to self. Interior contradictions (the urge to record vs. the vow of silence) play out in tactile folds, not abstracts. The stance crystallizes with palpable forfeiture: she pays with her name, voice, and future agency, earning the hush she enters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each repetition of fold, root, and breath thickens the silence until the final exhalation reweights it into regenerative matter. The swan’s creases function as a recursive ledger; the vine’s tentative touch is the single tightening that forecloses intervention. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options (speak, act, judge) remain possible but are legibly renounced, cost paid in the breath that settles into stone.</comment>

<comment>The library’s composting paper, breathing vine, and obsidian lag-wall are not backdrop; they actively filter choice—she can only witness because the setting digests assertion itself. The swan’s soft cloth-like paper and the vine’s exploratory tendril supply micro-setting that constrains the final refusal. Spatial choreography is clean: east-side breakthrough, shelf-by-shelf engulfment, tentative retreat, all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve witness without judgment—faces one visible tightening: the vine tests the swan, forcing her to hold still or intervene. She pays the immediate cost of breath and enduring silence, foreclosing speech permanently. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the lyric mode; the plant’s inhale/exhale rhythm is the only external pressure needed to crystallize her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through composting imagery: knowledge returns to soil, silence becomes generative, destruction is change wearing “unfamiliar clothes.” No character moralizes; the final image of breath settling into stone reweights every prior fold as a quiet act of creation. The reader leaves with the felt after-effect that renunciation can be a form of renewal—earned, not preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is a hush made syntax: long vowel-rich sentences that taper into monosyllables mirror the keeper’s exhalation. Perceptual signature—she “grips reality loosely” like a bird soon released—colors every description. Patterned elision (no dialogue, minimal verbs of force) is taught in the first paragraph and paid off when the vine withdraws without action from her.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes: clauses lengthen during observation, contract at the moment of refusal. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“crumbling was not the same as collapsing”—and never muddies causality. Zero loops or filler; each noun does double duty (paper = record, shroud, bird). Final line lands clean, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The regenerative archive that digests its own canon feels inevitable yet fresh; the origami swan as palimpsest ledger is a device I haven’t seen. Risk—the entire arc is a refusal to act—heightens coherence because the world itself collaborates. Specificity of composting ink into breathing flowers makes the concept non-portable.</comment>
