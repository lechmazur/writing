<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—rational cataloguer vs. intuitive mystic—coexist in every beat; the decision to pour the vial is earned by the compass void and the prior petrichor archive, costing her the safety of measurable memory. Embodied emotion is precise: “the silence grew so complete that it became its own kind of permission.” No label-speak; even “psychometry” is framed as external skepticism. The final renunciation—carrying the unbottled knowledge—carries visible cost in the altered gait of the last line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lagoon’s offer refused, the factory still silent, Maren’s stance reweighted—shown in the final sentence’s “tenderness of someone who knows that every surface is a door.” Causal chain holds: compass void → descent → hinged awakenings → vial release → irreversible internal change. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“limestone cliffs behind the factory”). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends in Accumulative/Textural deepening with conceptual cost legible in the refusal to stay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the compass needle and the vials function as portable environments that constrain choice. The lagoon’s faint luminosity is filtered through Maren’s collector bias—she notices scent before light, stone before water. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → pour → rise → climb. The final image reuses the boots introduced in paragraph two, now charged with new knowledge. Meets 9+ gate: the compass recharges the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to earth’s full memory—faces one decisive tightening: the pouring of the vial commits her to carry what cannot be distilled, foreclosing the archival life. Cost is felt immediately in the “something she could never distill into a bottle.” Agency drives every beat; even the descent is motivated by the compass’s impossible void. No external coincidence; pressure is situational and accumulative. Sufficient for 8.7; would need a persistent external constraint to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge exceeds explanation—emerges through the compass void and the refusal to stay, never stated. The petrichor motif shifts from collectible fragment to inseparable medium, reweighting the premise in the final pour. Ambiguity is purposeful: we never “see” the full memory, only the cost of touching it. Final image of boots on earth offers non-literal resonance: every step is now a potential door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: rain-scent as currency, mineral tears, silence that “listens back.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses in the cave, then elongated cadence at the lagoon. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts smoothly from external witness to interior hinge. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are voice-motivated to signal psychometric transfer. 9+ quick test met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “limestone wept mineral tears” supports mood without clutter. No mixed metaphors; void-as-silence sustains acoustic imagery throughout. High information density—three vials, rope, compass, headlamp named once and used. Proofing clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of petrichor-collector + psychometry + vanished expedition feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. The compass that points inward re-tools a classic trope without exposition dumps. Risk-taking in the “hinged awakenings” concept pays off: the story commits fully to non-verbal revelation and still lands legible cost. Transformation test: swap Maren’s vocation or object and the entire arc collapses.</comment>
