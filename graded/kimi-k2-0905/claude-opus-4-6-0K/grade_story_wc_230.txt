<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—she “presses her fingers into the loam” rather than naming feelings—and her refusal to hand over the eye until she warns of its limits shows a hierarchy of values (truth > relief) with visible cost.  The woman’s hope-to-curtain of silence arc is sketched quickly but believably.  No contradictory impulse is dramatized in Maren during the final beat, so the 9+ quick test just fails.</comment>

<comment>Causal spine holds: because the virus enforces truth, therefore Maren flees; because the eye offers partial occlusion, the stranger comes; because Maren gives it, both sit in charged poise.  Closure is Earned Stasis—the eye’s loan costs Maren her last buffer, felt in the final “broken instrument” image.  No teleporting props or outline sequencing; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options.</comment>

<comment>The hanging orchard is never backdrop: cables “sang,” trees “groan,” storm wind occludes psychic noise and physically endangers the descent to the shelter.  Micro-setting (the tin box, storm-softened earth) is handled during action and constrains the choice to trade/gift the eye.  Final image of wind through broken trees recharges the opening metaphor, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to survive total transparency—tightens when the woman’s raw broadcast invades Maren’s refuge; the loan of the eye forecloses Maren’s own shield, a visible price.  One meaningful turn suffices at this length; no reversal is needed.  Cost is legible: “for the first time… her presence softened into something Maren could stand beside,” trading solitude for shared fragility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of consent-in-privacy emerges through action, not statement: the virus stole it, the eye partially restores it, the final silence is a mutual choice.  No character moralizes; the closing image of “music that was imperfect, and therefore bearable, and therefore true” offers Conceptual Repricing without sermon.  Ambiguity lingers—will the woman return? will Maren regret?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices soil firmness, fungal logic, “broadcast” as somatic ache—no filter-verb stack.  Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments slightly under storm pressure (“A few hours.” “Sometimes less.”).  No head-hopping; woman’s interior is inferred only through Maren’s bodily reaction, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, dual-job: “wind and rain occluded things—sound, sight, the constant low hum” packs world-rule, sensory filter, and metaphor in one stroke.  No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold.  Only reason not 9+ is a single near-cliché “heat from a wound,” but it passes unnoticed in the beat’s flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus conceit is familiar, yet grafting it onto a truffle-forager’s fungal rationality and a Czech monastery glass eye feels idiosyncratic and inevitable.  Risky choice to make the climax a quiet hand-off rather than theft or betrayal pays off—the final image reconfigures the premise without retreat.  Removing ravine, storm, or eye collapses the story; specificity earns the high band.</comment>
