<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The philosopher’s refusal to capitulate to the Council is rooted in years of subterranean labor and delivers a credible renunciation; the moment Sera silently lowers the manuscript, his abrasive calm gains cost. Interiority is mineral-specific and embodied, not abstract. Missing a second beat of interior contradiction under fresh pressure keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Dren’s quiet return to scraping forecloses compromise and the cost is legible in Sera’s silence and the threatened sealing of shafts. Accumulative lens holds: sediment density reweights the stake without causal reversals. One tightening suffices; wall-as-archive pattern is taught early and fulfills the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass cog and calcium strata function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the cog’s impossible teeth physically rebuke the Council and charge the final lantern flare. Sewer topology stays spatially coherent with ankle-deep water and dry pipe staging. Atmospheric detail is filtered through Dren’s lithic gaze—no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of empirical knowledge versus mythic erasure—tightens once when Sera threatens to seal access; Dren’s refusal narrows his future to guerilla teaching. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the council’s power to bury him. No further escalation required under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of narrative-as-stratified-truth emerges through sediment image and cog, never lectured. Final silence between Dren and Sera reweights the council’s manuscript from authority to artifact without moralizing. Counter-reading survives: both preservation and myth are sedimentary accretions, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Dren’s lithic perception; diction of “arterial guts” and “abrasive calm” is character-bound. Free indirect rhythm mirrors mineral patience. No head-hopping; Sera’s interior is legible only through externals, maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and mineral weight; no loops or scaffold. Information is double-loaded—“calcium and waste deposits that encoded decades”—without clutter. Metaphors stay geologic and coherent. One minor adjective stack (“silted water”) does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken-city sewer-archive is fresh; brass cog as empirical trump card reverses familiar “lost knowledge” trope. Conceptual risk—philosophy as sedimentary endurance—pays off in final image. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the thematic core.</comment>
