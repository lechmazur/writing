<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—career composure vs. personal obsession—are dramatized in the micro-choice to draft the memo with the risky flourish; the cost is palpable when she seals it and the glass clears, foreclosing retreat. Interiority stays embodied (palm on glass, envy of the falcon) and never drifts into label-speak. The atlas blank page becomes the final, irreversible act that pays off every prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: falcon return → decoded coordinates → phrasebook confirmation → memo drafted → ink on blank page, each step narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the first irreversible mark in the atlas—earned by every prior linkage. No teleporting props or outline sequencing; even the condensation pattern is causally seeded early and pays off in the storm clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and iron perch constrain action (storm shelf, isolation, limited heat) and charge the final image of cleared glass. Micro-setting objects—atlas blank, phrasebook dog-ear, condensation on window—are handled in motion and alter choices. Sensory hierarchy filters through Maren’s cartographer gaze, integrating detail into goal-directed action without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace the cartographic shrug with a period—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once: the impossible tri-river source forces her to risk professional decorum with the poetic memo flourish. The cost is visible in the final ink line; options collapse from dotted uncertainty to definitive mark. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the human need to name what resists naming, and the violence of that act. The reweighted phrasebook entry (“mouth that speaks three tongues”) and the single ink period refract this without moralizing. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer—tranquility after the mark is both triumph and wound—leaving plausible counter-readings intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: precise cartographic diction braided with lyrical compression (“rivers remember”). Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences tighten into the staccato of memo drafting and final ink. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly under pressure. Free indirect style stays clean, and the rare flourish (“gravity had a sense of humor”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences layer multiple jobs (condensation pattern → storm clock → emotional barometer). Metaphors are sparse, coherent, and grounded in POV expertise. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final ink beat, then cuts to held silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tri-river singularity is a fresh geological mystery; coupling it with cartographic obsession rather than adventuring hero gives new angle. Transformation test passes—Maren’s specific professional guilt and phrasebook key would collapse if swapped. Risk is present but constrained; the piece avoids gimmickry, yet the conceptual twist feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
