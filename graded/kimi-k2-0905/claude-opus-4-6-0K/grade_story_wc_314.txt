<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—sentimental hoarder vs. rigorous alchemist—drives every beat; the starling epiphany braids logic/intuition with visible cost (tears before understanding). The apple bite crystallizes the shift, foreclosing her old note-taking stance. One slip: “secretly sentimental” is named once rather than shown through earlier micro-choices, a minor label-tax that keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the apple’s taste reweights the entire premise—sentiment becomes the catalyst, notebook abandoned. Causal lens holds: every beat (crystal harvest → flame test → starlings → apple) is linked by “because/therefore” with felt cost (eleven years, mother-memory, tears). No orientation debt; spatial anchors (waterfall, orchard, tree) are clear by word 80. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard’s perpetual twilight and prismatic mist are not backdrop; they supply the non-pigment light that lets the crystal+flame reaction occur, directly enabling closure. Micro-setting (apple in hand) charges the final image with kitchen-warm scent, reconfiguring her worldview. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—alchemist notices phase boundaries, baker’s daughter smells bread in an apple. No slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—tightens when the controlled flame proves “perfect and not enough,” forcing her to risk the starling-guided drop. Price is legible: the apple falls, she cries, notebook ritual ends. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal inflation. Coincidence (starlings arrive) complicates rather than resolves, serving the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder is not the enemy of precision but its missing variable. The apple’s taste reprises dawn-in-ice and mother’s kitchen, fusing personal memory with cosmic threshold—Conceptual Repricing that reweights alchemy itself. No moralizing, only embodied recognition. Ambiguity lingers: orchard remains nameless, future transformation unwritten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—alchemical color theory, baker’s scent memory, starling script. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under experiment; no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contaminated. One hairline slip: “ancient freshness” is the only static descriptor, but it is later recharged by the apple, so forgiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Figurative language is sparse, patterned, and paid off—“colors that did not exist” return in prismatic mist; starling helix becomes hand angle. No mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats: long suspension before crystal drop, single-clause bite. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy alchemy + murmuration cryptography feels fresh, yet inevitable once seeded. The orchard’s nameless mutability and the apple that tastes like a phase boundary transform trope into lived epiphany. Risk—letting birds supply the scientific variable—pays off emotionally and conceptually. Specificity (Cairn Morrigh summit, mortar-ground pigments) anchors the surreal in tactile reality.</comment>
