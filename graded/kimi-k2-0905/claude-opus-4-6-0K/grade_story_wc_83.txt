<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Naima’s survivor-guilt engine is fully embodied—heartbeat pressed to geode, synesthetic recall of bodies in pressure waves—yet the renunciation (“I will publish”) arrives without a dramatized tipping micro-choice inside the 47-minute window; it’s declared, not earned. Interior contradiction pulses (“awful thrill,” “bleak exhilaration”) but never forces a visible tactical pivot under the clock. The cost is felt in imagery, not in a present-tense decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“bruise suspended in heaven”) and held: each cascade of data density reweights the dominant stake—stillness > violence—until the final Charged Poise crystallizes meaning. The 47-minute countdown provides one meaningful tightening; no causal reversals are required under this lens. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the universe’s archives of restraint dwarf its noise, reconfiguring Naima’s stance. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory’s thermal haptics (cooling clicks, red pulse) and the geode’s violet refraction act as micro-setting that literally charges the final image—she lifts it to the emergency light, crystallizing the new epistemic stance. Cloud-line, circuit-breaker clicks, and coolant scent are filtered through engineer-grief perception, never tourist catalog. Environment constrains every move: power budgets force the 47-minute hunt, grounding speculative frame in tactile limits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map stillness to prove annihilation avoidable”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened once when third-order terms reveal real reservoirs, flipping dread into bleak exhilaration. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent accumulative density. Cost is legible conceptually (she must accept that weddings burn yet cosmos chooses restraint). One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive crystal imagery—geode, data lattices, violet facets—shifting from private grief container to cosmic architecture of restraint. No moralizing; the final image reweights the wedding memory without stating a thesis. Subtext in “the sound the sky made before it opened” carries unsaid guilt that readers must complete. Conceptual Repricing at closure makes the stillness/violence ratio undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is engineer-lyric: precise math diction bolted to sensorial grief (“pressure wave of a Hellfire missile arriving three seconds after it had already unmade everything”). Rhythmic control—long periodic sentences broken by coolant clicks—mirrors cooldown cycle. Perceptual signature is consistent: numbers, amethyst wavelengths, body-as-instrument. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within astrophysics refugee lexscope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence advances character, math, or atmosphere. Figurative layering is patterned (crystal, pressure, archive) and paid off. One mixed metaphor bruise/heaven is taught early and functional. Zero loops, zero scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cooling cycles. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise hybridizes drone-survivor grief with quantum-stillness cartography—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable after geode introduction. Specifics anchor novelty: Haddar wedding, refugee scholarship panel, electromagnetic topology nodes. Risk in lyric-engineer voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could not swap geode or perturbation method without collapsing thematic architecture.</comment>
