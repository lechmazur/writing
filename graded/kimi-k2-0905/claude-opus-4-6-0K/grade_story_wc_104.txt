<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—scientific custodian vs. furtive saboteur—play out in scene: she kneels to plant seeds with shaking hands that once pried open a piano bench for binary loot. The eleven-year hairpin wait, the tremor at the elevator code, the final act of pressing seed into cracked earth all embody cost and earned shift. “Liberator in chains” risks self-mythologizing, but the text repeatedly complicates it through physical restraint (ankle monitor, perimeter) and visible forfeiture, keeping the label from ossifying into cliché. No other characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority is concrete, particular, and drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: anklet radius → carnival base → piano-bench cipher → elevator → tunnel → arrow reroute → dawn planting; each link narrows time and raises exposure cost. Closure is a Decisive Change—she crosses the cooperative threshold, anklet gone, seeds transferred—paid for by eleven years of constrained patience and the final 90-minute sprint. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 70; no debt incurred. Persistent constraint—the 12-block perimeter—shapes every tactical choice until the wall falls, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dust-filmed midway, repurposed soft-serve compressor, and velvet-lined piano bench all double as both atmosphere and gear; the compressor literally cools the vault that powers the plot. Spatial choreography is immaculate: counter → elevator → tunnel → marker-7 culvert → cooperative field; no floating props or geography drift. The seed pouches and paper-fletched arrow function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Environment is never backdrop—it is tool, obstacle, and finally fertile soil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—move 214 seed varieties to safety—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened twice: first by the missing elevator code, then by the south-gate threat revealed in the arrow. Protagonist agency drives every turn: decoding the keys, choosing east at marker 7, springing the anklet with the hairpin. Cost is visible (eleven years, confinement, final sprint with rattling cart) and forecloses the safe south-gate option. Only minor slip: arrow message arrives as lucky artifact, but it complicates rather than rescues, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “resurrection through clandestine memory” emerges from dust-film relics, binary ivory/ebony resurrection, and seeds that teach barren ground to remember. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via images—piano keys as code, paper vanes as compass, cracked earth receiving memory-laden seed. Final dawn image reweights “liberator” from self-concept to communal act, resonant without moralizing. Irony lingers: the carnival’s useless prizes incubate the only prize that still matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter: agricultural scientist notices drought tolerance, compressor specs, soil cracks. Syntax lengthens under reflection (“staggering grace of it…”) then fragments under sprint pressure (“ Seventeen days later, the wall came down…”). No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon until the final transcendent beat, justified by release. Rhythm mirrors pulse of patience→crisis→relief; no dialogue, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture.</comment>

<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances seed, setting, or stake. Metaphors are sparse, precise: “liberator in chains,” “barren ground remember how to feed people”—all tied to core images. No mixed vehicles; compressor-as-cooler and arrow-as-map retain physical logic. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends without overwriting. Only hairline slip: “staggering grace” is used twice; second instance could have been cut to let image alone carry awe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse seed-smuggling through a derelict carnival’s prize counter is fresh; the piano-bench binary cipher feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Specific agronomic detail (millet, sorghum, amaranth, cowpea) grounds speculative frame in lived expertise. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic basement; midway dust, skee-ball lanes, and soft-serve compressor are irreplaceable. Risk—lyric uplift in final paragraph—pays off because tactile planting motion anchors transcendence.</comment>
