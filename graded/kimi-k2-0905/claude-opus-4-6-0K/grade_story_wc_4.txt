<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is textured through perceptual signature (“cartographies of grief”) and embodied ritual (arranging arcs). The final choice to stay and let the town grieve communally is earned by 11-year investment; cost is felt in her refusal to leave. Competence balanced with quiet compulsion; contradictions (archive of unsolvables/need to solve) stay implicit but active.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arc of fourteen photographs crystallizes into collective Charged Poise—“the town could finally, gently, set down what it had carried.” Causal chain holds: archival grief → field visits → pin-up arcs → townspeople gather → Maren stays; each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; lavender/factory introduced within 50 words and motif anchors final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lavender scent, rust flakes, dove-gray leather act as micro-settings that constrain ritual precision. Spatial choreography clean: stone bench, vines climbing, pin-up wall; no floating props. Field supplies the living palette that rephotographs ruin; setting evolves beat-to-beat (vines “another imperceptible inch”). Final image of swaying lavender/butterfly charges closure with olfactory motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmute private grief into communal healing—signaled paragraph three. Mid-story pivot: Maren shifts from solitary arc-maker to host of shared space; townspeople’s arrival tightens her responsibility. Cost legible: she forfeits sole custodianship and accepts permanent caretaker stance. Agency steady; no external antagonist needed; escalation is density of participation and relinquishing control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—arcs, vines, lavender—rather than statement. Final line reframes “puzzle” from solvable problem to living garden: “to be tended,” a Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity preserved: no verdict on whether collective healing erases or honors loss. Subtext in white butterfly blur: motion within stasis. Avoids moralizing; resonance earned by concrete tending acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds Maren’s perceptual lens: “softness of a moth’s wing,” “visual grammar.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for calm, clipped fragments for choice beats (“She pressed the final photograph”). No head-hop; knowledge stays character-bound. Vivid idiosyncratic metaphors (“bones of some gentle beast”) feel owned, not borrowed. Voice consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density: “lavender exhaled its purple scent in waves” (smell + motion). Varied sentence cadence; no template runs. Occasional metaphor richness is purposeful and pattern-coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “arc of…” repeated four times—intentional motif, not artifact. Zero filter-verb clusters. Final sentence bridge (“and watch it grow into something new”) lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshens post-industrial elegy by folding archival impulse into horticultural performance. “Puzzle archivist” occupation is non-stock; photograph-curves as grief grammar feels specific. Stakes inverted—goal is not solution but cultivation. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure paid off in communal closure. Could swap names but method and tone constellation would collapse; therefore sufficient transformation.</comment>
