<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marguerite’s guarded interiority is rendered in concrete micro-choices—adjusting the dehumidifier, tracing thumb-oil stains—that dramatize her shift from hoarder to sharer. The final earned stasis (“she had finally found someone to trust with the echo”) costs her the anonymity she had clung to, visible in the unknotted chest. Elias functions less as a second character than as a catalyst, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is modest, but her single-POV contradiction—yearning to preserve yet fearing connection—remains active in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the still dust-mote image crystallizes her new equilibrium with felt opportunity cost—she forecloses isolation yet keeps the songs suspended. Accumulative lens holds: dust, paper, and meteorite density layer until the final cadence reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no因果 gaps. Persistent constraint—the attic’s fragile atmosphere—shapes every tactical adjustment, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The attic’s dust swirl functions as micro-setting that literally constrains each preservation tactic; meteorite chip and acid-free folders are tactile extensions. Sensory selection skews olfactory and haptic—“foxed pages,” “talon-scratched edges”—filtered through archivist priorities. Spatial choreography stays coherent across trapdoor entry and table work. Final dust-mote image recharges prior motif while embodying the new emotional stasis, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the echo of lost songs without re-exposure to risk”—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Elias asks her to interpret, forcing her to vocalize what had been hoarded; the cost is the irrevocable sharing of the songs. Accumulative escalation via dust, paper, and meteorite density suffices for this lens; no causal reversals required. Price is legible: she surrenders sole custodianship, ending her self-exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation is sterile without performance; memory needs a living throat. Subtext resides in objects—meteorite as alien pitch pipe, dust as barometer of safety—rather than exposition. Final image reframes earlier dust readings into a poetics of suspended grief rather than control. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what will happen once the songs leave the attic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance anchored to Marguerite; perceptual signature is archivist-sensory—cataloguing ink, humidity, pigeon-down. Syntax modulates from long reflective sentences to shorter beats under skylight tension. No dialogue voice to evaluate; narrative voice avoids filter-verb clutter. Elliptical compression (“she would never be the woman she had been”) is earned and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“blooming and withering at once” mirrors melodic structure without spillover. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening anchors tone and stakes, final line recharges dust motif. High information density: each sentence advances character, texture, or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—analog-pigeon music archive tended by a reclusive ex-trainer—feels fresh and specific. Meteorite as tuning weight transforms familiar “artifact sparks memory” trope into acoustical physics. Risk-taking lies in accumulative, quiet plot; no gimmicks. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic artifacts, confirming integration.</comment>
