<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s “perceptive calm” is repeatedly named but only once shown (reading the room at twelve); the rest is summary. Scraping the chalk signs in the final paragraph is a concrete renunciation, but the prior beats between 12 and 23 are compressed montage, so the interior contradiction never plays out in scene. Still, the folded cruzeiro in pocket lands as earned keepsake-cost, satisfying the arc of acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the idea that value and identity are circular fictions, culminating in the Conceptual Repricing of scraping the markers. Single transition (gap to adulthood) is legible; anchors clear by 120 words. The collapse of Meridian is told, not dramatized, but that compression serves the pattern rather than breaks it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train is vividly sensory—rusted couplings, fading acrobats, chalk grit under thumbnail—yet never constrains a present-moment choice until the final erasure. The worthless bills function as micro-setting that charges the last image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Corporate-office shard is deliberately sparse; still, spatial coherence is maintained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he keep protecting the ruin or release it?”—emerges late but tightens in the final third when he scrapes each chalk mark. Prior escalation is textural accumulation rather than causal beats, appropriate to lens. Cost is the surrender of territorial claim, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of circularity vs. ownership emerges through the accruing gallery of obsolete currency and the final act of returning the ruin to entropy. No moralizing; the cruzeiro in pocket reframes earlier obsession as acceptance. Subtext of paternal legacy is understated but resonates in the quiet ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“weather of a room,” “collective fiction”—is consistent and character-specific. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences vs. terse final scrape, mirroring release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong information density; figurative language is selective (“fading like old bruises”) and avoids clutter. One paraphrase loop—“value was a collective fiction / borders shifted / sometimes a country reinvents…”—drops momentum slightly. Otherwise clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Circus-train as secular confession booth plus obsolete bank-notes gives fresh angle on inherited failure. Startup rise-and-fall is familiar, but linkage to father’s highway robberies via “intersection of movement and need” feels non-obvious. Scraping protective marks as closure image is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
