<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—weaponised patience against residual tenderness—lives in her micro-choice to extend the brass hand; the duel scar motivates without overt label. Eckhardt’s diplomatic ferocity surfaces only in reported past, not in-scene action, softening present-moment stakes. Relationship shift lands with felt cost: decades of fencing converted to shared forward motion. Earned renunciation clear, but secondary-character pressure is off-page, capping top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: taking the mechanical hand reconfigures their war of questions into joint pilgrimage, cost visible in unfinished sundial half. Causal chain intact—letter → decode → wait → offer → walk—no outline gaps. Orientation anchored within 120 words; location, time, and POV stable. One lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: pattern of angles, shadows, and brook-light accrues until stance crystallises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Glass-atrium light and brook-murmur braid through every beat, narrowing Lena’s attention and echoing “dignified chaos.” Half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting that constrains decoding action and charges final image. Physical choreography across atrium remains coherent; no spatial drift. Sensory hierarchy reflects philosopher’s gaze—angle, reflection, sound—without tourist surplus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will they resume dueling or pioneer joint inquiry—signalled early and tightened when she places needle-card on blank plaster, foreclosing solitary path. Escalation by Accumulative lens: each shadow-line and brook-gleam thickens emotional density until handshake becomes inevitable reversal. Cost legible in irreversible abandonment of antagonistic stance. No external antagonist required; internal conflict sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern: encoded angles → decoded empathy → shared destination, avoiding explicit moral. Image of unfinished sundial reweights prior duels as mere morning hours, afternoon still unwritten. Subtextual silence around “I was wrong” dignifies theme without therapy-speak. Final reconfiguration invites reflection on inquiry as motion, not victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Lena, perceptual signature tuned to angular light and metallic joint sound. Prose rhythm mirrors her controlled patience—long sentences holding breath, then short release: “She almost smiled.” Free indirect blends cleanly: “That was like Eckhardt.” No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but carries subtext. Distinct voice sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence often layers setting, metaphor, and interiority. Metaphors consistent—dueling, light, geometry—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase—“destinations of thought”—reads as Lena’s scholarly idiom, justified. Minor filter-verb cluster “She thought” avoidable but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing sword-dueling philosophers with sundial-cipher feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of rivals reconciling is elevated by material code and prosthetic cost. Risk of conceptual premise pays off without gimmickry. Specificity—Danish needle card, Koln Symposium—anchors originality. Transformation test passes: story disintegrates if codes or mechanical arm removed.</comment>
