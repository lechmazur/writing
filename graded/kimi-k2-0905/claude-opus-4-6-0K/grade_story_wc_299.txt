<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—craving silence yet chasing the ghost of sound—are embodied in the tactile handling of the grille cloth; the final micro-choice to “write the appraisal for the record” crystallizes his shift from performer to archivist with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and music-nerd specific; no stock therapy-speak. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“confidently uncertain”) that momentarily abstracts the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scrap reweights Marcus’s identity from failed showman to quiet keeper of echoes, cost felt in the phrase “so the silence would know what it was holding.” Causal chain holds—Harrisburg failure → quarry exile → cloth discovery → archival act—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One soft spot: the tin box arrives by convenient off-stage excavation, but it complicates rather than resolves, so permitted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quarry trailer’s ticking heater, wax-paper relics, and “cupped hands” limestone walls are filtered through Marcus’s audiophile senses; the cloth’s weave becomes the micro-setting that constrains his final choice. Sensory hierarchy is tight—sound/memory first, touch second—mirroring his obsession. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Marcus find purpose after public humiliation—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph forces a choice: cling to silence or re-enter the circuit of memory. The cloth’s reappearance reweights the stake; the cost is the irrevocable acceptance of an invisible role. No false escalation; the tightening is singular but sufficient for 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of uncelebrated maintenance versus performed glory. The grille cloth motif migrates from junk to relic to archival mandate, recharging the central question without moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—silence “cupped” to receive whatever voice he offers—leaving reader to weigh the price of anonymity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—frequency metaphors, thread-count jargon, cigarette-smoke palette. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for nostalgia, staccato for shame. No head-hopping; Rita’s entrance is rendered through his auditory filter. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet musical—information dual-loaded in almost every line (“aluminum box perched above an echo valley”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (sound/silence/geology). One tiny register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction sneaks in via free indirect style, but it fits Marcus’s cataloguing mind and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: antiques authentication meets live-sound nostalgia in a limestone quarry—specific, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. The grille cloth as archival umbilical cord transforms a roadside trope into lived vocation. Risk is quiet, but coherence is high; no derivative echo of famous backstage stories.</comment>
