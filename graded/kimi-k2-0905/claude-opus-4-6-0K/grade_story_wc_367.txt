<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior voice is vivid and idiosyncratic—her laughter as currency, her need to steer rather than rule, her tactile handling of the wick. Contradictory impulses (terror vs duty, fatalism vs hope) are threaded through embodied action, not abstract labels. The cost is felt: she keeps climbing though the world is cracked, and the final stasis—waiting for the next storm—forecloses an easier life. Only the “accidentally prophetic” beat is slightly under-dramatized; we hear the label more than see a fresh misfire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each night’s ritual thickens the pattern until the final sweep of gold carries undeniable conceptual cost—the shared dawn she pays for with solitary erosion. Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam keeps traveling, the lighthouse keeps standing, her laughter keeps greeting the next storm; the price is her perpetual exile in the tower. Causality is internal—because she climbs, the world retains a common horizon—earned by earlier ritual detail, not coincidence. The only hairline slip: the school-burn childhood anecdote is told in summary; if it had been dramatized the prophecy causality would feel fully tested rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald stone pulses under palm, salt-ground stars press into glass, oil reservoir and hand-blown wick are all handled, not catalogued. The lighthouse body, the wick-as-tool, and the storm-lit sea each constrain tactics: she must climb, must use fragile glass, must accept the storm’s answer. Micro-setting (spiral stairs, lantern room floor) channels her ritual movements; macro-setting (star-thick sky, black water) mirrors and magnifies the internal stakes. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can one woman re-forge a shared horizon in a fractured truthscape? Pressure escalates by density: each nightly climb, each whispered weather, each dream planted in a stranger layers risk and weariness. One visible price: LED array torn out, oil reservoir salvaged—she chooses fragile antiquity over modern ease, and that fragility stays live (she trims the wick, fears its breaking). The final beam is both triumph and life-sentence; options narrow to perpetual vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accruing image of light that remembers: shared reality as a communal dream bought by a solitary keeper’s erosion. No moral is stated; the ending image—lighthouse sweeping, Maren laughing—reweights laughter from madness to earned instrument. Subtext operates in gesture: trimming the wick = editing tomorrow’s consensus; shadows folded into light = truth as palimpsest. The concept stays complex: she steers, not controls, leaving ambiguity about whether the dream-planting is gift or imposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual grammar: “storms spoke,” “wind accepted currency,” “light that remembered.” Syntax flexes with pressure—longer clauses when she listens, staccato fragments when thunder cracks. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly hers. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (no academic register), yet achieves lyric density through selective repetition and marine vocabulary without slipping into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is taught early and patterned (“salt ground into dark glass,” “shadows pressed like flowers”) then reprised at closure, avoiding density overload. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent to optics and sea. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths alternate between short gasps and longer sweeps, mirroring climb and beam rotation. Only micro-loop: “ancient shadows” appears three times; because it is the core motif the repetition reads intentional rather than churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise fuses post-truth collapse with maritime magic realism: lighthouse keeper as consensus-making editor of reality—fresh angle on dystopia without violence or tech MacGuffin. The physics-of-wish mechanism (total internal reflection trapping memory) is both scientifically named and folklorically felt, avoiding pat explanation. Risk is taken with quiet ending—no rebellion, no crowd scene—yet the crystallized poise proves more haunting than spectacle. Removing the emerald stone or the glass wick would collapse the entire conceit; specificity makes the fusion inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
