<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—preserving ruin vs. admitting the girl—are dramatized in the final handshake of scars; the ring’s shift from closure token to possible key gives the renunciation visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, rooted in ash and iron rather than labels. The girl functions as secondary pressure, forcing Maren’s micro-choice to imagine opening a door again. No competence overreach; flaws actively complicate the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren imagines opening a door—an on-page reconfiguration that costs her three years of curated exile. The accumulative lens holds; each reflective block is anchored to present stimuli (ring, scars, starlight) and alters her stance. Orientation is clear within 120 words. No causality breaks; the ending’s conceptual cost is undeniable yet quiet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s absent roof and starlit ash constrain Maren’s maintenance ritual and later allow the girl literal entry; environment shapes both tactics and final image. Micro-setting—the ring on her thumb—functions as tactile “wall.” Selective sensory detail (charred pew, cold iron) filters through Maren’s caretaker bias. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will keep the threshold frozen or let air in—tightens once when the girl mirrors her suffocation. Accumulative deepening: ash, scars, and starlight layer until the final handshake reweights the stake. Agency is renunciation-to-possibility rather than overt action; cost is the loss of her zero-contact stasis. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without external coincidence.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of sanctuary—from sealed ruin to breathable absence—without explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the ring’s muteness and the scar-linked silence. Final image reweights “loaded emptiness” into generative space. No thematic echo; the girl’s line “They love me so much I can’t breathe” is character-bound, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Maren’s tactile perception; diction stays ash-dusted and iron-heavy. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for ruin memory, staccato when the girl speaks. No head-hopping; girl’s interior accessed only through Maren’s read of scars. Compression (“tender shadow keeper”) is taught early and paid off in final mutual teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Information density high—ring, scars, starlight triangulate in <800 words. Metaphors (broken fingers, tourniquet love) stay physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ash-settling cadence of the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“caretaker of ruin as teacher of breathing”—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Scars as dialogue, ring as anti-key, and loaded emptiness as shelter synthesize fresh angles on familiar exile/mentor arcs. No derivative echoes; the burnt cathedral under starlight is rendered without apocalyptic cliché. Risk in quiet closure pays off.</comment>
