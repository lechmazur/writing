<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s posthumous, collective-leading motivation is legible and emotionally consistent, but because she is off-page agency speaking via chalk, interior contradiction and embodied cost accrue only by proxy to the colonists; no single on-page colonist bears a visible renunciation or flaw-driven mis-step that re-configures their own path, so the “earned” bar stays mid-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: “WELL DONE” re-weights every prior instruction under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the copper-bell release embodies felt cost, and the ghost’s absence crystallizes collective stance; causality across mosaic shards is clean, orientation taught early, no late ambiguity—only the off-page protag keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, sideways trees, gravity-as-suggestion, and the copper bell are woven through choice (irrigation reroute, seedling move, pollinator tending); the bell’s final resonance charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate even though environmental constraint on tactics is indirect rather than brutal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collective survival via Maren’s instructions—tightens once per shard (arch collapse, root rot, butterfly dependency); each escalation is an Accumulative deepening that re-weights effort, with visible price in labor and grief, though no single colonist is forced into a personal trade-off that would push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal continuity beyond death emerges organically from chalk logistics and harvest payoff; “brambled hope” image and bell vibration avoid explicit moral, leaving resonant ambiguity about agency versus grace—only a hairline slip into sentiment in “Somewhere unseen, Maren was still tending them.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Collective-memory narrator maintains lyric distance, patterned elision (“no one remembered…”) taught in opening and paid off in final arch; diction is consistent, rhythmic, and orchard-specific, with no head-hop or register drift—near flawless control for a mosaic ghost story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density (every sentence layers image, motion, stakes), metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“roots threading stone like stitches through torn cloth”), and cadence modulates to breathe at harvest release—no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-mortem agricultural mentorship via chalk is a fresh synthesis; planet physics and pollinator bell are particular rather than quirky, and the inversion of ghost-as-foreman feels inevitable in hindsight—risk is present but safe compared to truly boundary-pushing forms.</comment>
