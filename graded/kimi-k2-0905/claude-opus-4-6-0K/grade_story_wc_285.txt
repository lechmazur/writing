<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harlan’s stoic patience, embodied through the yarn-needle ritual, is specific and charged; the interior contradiction (duty vs. personal cost) is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, muting the final renunciation’s sting. His “closely attentive” trait is lived-in—he clocks gutter ticks and horse breath—but the passenger remains a cipher, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the endurance stance carries credible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The palimpsest concept is taught early and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the oldest promise reweights the deed with undeniable social cost (“the crossing stays public”). Causality is ambient, not chains of event, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens; one sharpening occurs when the fog’s thinning directly mirrors the layered promise clarifying. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, river, gutter ticks, and needle form a micro-setting that actively filters perception and finally charges the image: the ferry moves only after the oldest promise is honored. Selective sensory layering (sound before sight) mirrors the textual palimpsest. The yarn needle’s final stitch literalizes the thematic mend, cleanly constraining the closing image. Environment guides choice throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who owns the land—tightens once: Harlan’s ambient listening collapses the legal layers into a single, publicly binding truth. The price is conceptual but legible: the passenger gains land yet loses exclusivity, and Harlan’s quiet endurance costs him time and risk. Under Accumulative lens the pressure intensifies via density, not reversal; coincidence is absent. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: layered promises, like layered fog, can’t be erased—only honored. The yarn-needle’s final stitch reweights “distill complexity into essence” into a visual moral that feels discovered, not declared. Ambiguity lingers: private ownership vs. communal duty remain in tension. No closing moral, only a serene image that reconfigures value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Harlan’s perceptual signature: rain gutters tick, fog “percolates,” needle turns slow as thought. Syntax lengthens in calm, shortens when horses move—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; diction stays within a coachman’s lexicon. Distinctive, coherent, and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line craft: high density (“sounds percolate…ink bleeds through old parchment”), zero scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with fog density; paragraphs breathe. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes. Only hairline slip: “spindrift serenity” is lone purple phrase, but it serves atmospheric closure, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses legal palimpsest with meteorological palimpsest—fresh synthesis. Yarn needle as compass-tool is particular, not quirky ornament. Risk-taking in plotless, ambient escalation pays off because pattern is taught early and closure reweights concept. Could not swap fog for generic storm without breaking logic.</comment>
