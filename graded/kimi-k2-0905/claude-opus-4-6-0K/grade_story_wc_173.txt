<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilara’s refusal-as-identity is vivid and embodied; the final release carries visible cost (“light fading from her fingertips”). Interior contradiction stays poetic rather than dramatized in-scene, keeping her just off the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sigh→smile beat reweights the city’s power balance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—each untangled thread intensifies density until the prism opens; no因果 cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, prism, and falling snow constrain every tactile move; the crystalline facets double as tool and lock, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; one notch below 9 only because weather stays backdrop rather than active obstacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the silenced voices—tightens through each harmonic extraction; the final chorus forecloses the doctrine’s legitimacy. Cost is felt in her drained body and the city’s overnight epistemic shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of reclaimed voices; no declarative slogans. The closing “they would be too busy singing their own songs” reconfigures meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lush, lyric third-person remains tightly filtered through Ilara’s perceptual signature; cadence mirrors the harmonic untangling. No head-hop, no register drift; patterned elision (“between sigh and smile”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence does double duty (image + motion); occasional poetic surplus (“verse you couldn’t stop reciting”) nudges the density penalty but never loops or stalls causality. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, propelling to the final smile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “chaste courtesan” premise is flipped from cliché into a harmonic locksmith; the Harvest of Echoes reframes generational silence as literal technology. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in a closure that feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
