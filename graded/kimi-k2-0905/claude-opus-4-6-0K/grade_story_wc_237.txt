<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Yelen’s crystallization flaw is dramatized in the quill-catching hesitation and the pulse of rune-light in her scars; the shedding beat is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays concrete—smell of cooked skin, tea beading at the nib—avoiding label-speak. The final stance costs her mentor’s paradigm and her own skin, earned by prior failures. Micro-choices (dip, breathe, release) track a believable hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: amber silence → bruised belly → silver sheets of rain; density increases until the tea-ink glows and holds against the storm, reweighting the stake from escape to inscription. Closure is Charged Poise: the runes pulse once, heartbeat finding rhythm—cost is the irreversible visibility of her damage. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causal breaks. Persistent constraint: scars now glow as text, not shame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock on magnetic tether, lichen glowing impossible green, tea drying amber against pale stone—each sensory choice filters through Yelen’s scholar-eye and constrains her ritual. Weather evolves from hush to silver rain, mirroring internal release without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: quill, bowl, stone, storm front tracked continuously. The platform’s sway is micro-setting that alters the tea surface and timing of inscription, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert scars into legible language before storm erases attempt. Tightening occurs when tea-ink shifts from drying on surface to absorbing with faint glow—option to hide damage foreclosed. Cost is visible: glowing runes remain, public and permanent. Escalation is textural under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile inversion: damage becomes lexicon, not shame. No thesis stated; resonance arrives via final heartbeat pulse that reweights scars as living text. Ambiguity preserved—mentor’s dismissal still valid, yet superseded. Image of tea holding against rain offers non-literal answer: stories need not be washed away to be healed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains scholar’s perceptual signature: crow-quill nib “cut at a severe angle,” lichen “impossible green,” tea “dark as old blood.” Rhythm compresses under stress—single-sentence paragraphs at shedding moment—then lengthens with rain. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to Yelen. diction precise, never purple; register consistent with rune-trained mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay geological/meteorological. Strong verbs—“pooled,” “beaded,” “pulsed”—carry weight. No scaffold; even reflective lines tether to present stimulus (tea shift triggers release). Closure line clean, rhythmic, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy trope of magical inscription retooled through anti-heroic craft: failure scarified into text, not erased. Tea-writing superstition elevated to plausible scholar experiment, fused with meteorological platform. Fresh inflection: scars illuminate instead of stigmatize. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
