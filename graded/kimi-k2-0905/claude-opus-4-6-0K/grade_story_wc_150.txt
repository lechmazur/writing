<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and specific; the “hollow place behind her sternum” reappears with earned variation. Contradictory impulses surface when she both resists and reaches for the buried faith—yet the moment of kneeling lands as catharsis rather than choice, so the cost feels symbolic more than tactical. Still, the arc from detached cataloguer to grounded supplicant is coherent and emotionally legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the warm ground confirms ancestral reciprocity and re-prices her exile. Causal chain holds: buried dial → restore dial → sunlight re-admission → bodily surrender. Orientation anchors at line 4 (who/where/when). One minor elasticity: the smith’s off-stage collaboration is reported, not shown, but the click of the gnomon pays it off on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop; its root-rib lattice literally steers her brush and later her knees. Sensory hierarchy skews mineral-floral, diaspora-eye: she tastes calcium in the air before she names the trees. Flat stone between mango and iroko becomes the micro-setting that constraints the final gesture—she can’t kneel just anywhere. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore severed continuity with ancestors—tightens when the dial’s warmth taunts her disbelief. One meaningful deepening: the click of iron into stone momentarily fuses past ritual with present sun, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (heritage reclaimed) rather than practical; no tool or social coin is visibly lost, so pressure stays lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of burial: instead of hiding the dead, the orchard feeds the living. Subtextual tension between colonial suppression and subterranean preservation is carried by the dial’s burial, never lectured. Final image re-weights “return” as reciprocal—the ground waits, she answers—without moral tagline. Slight deduction for the echo phrase “interrupted journey” that edges toward prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Adaeze’s perceptual filter: British drizzle memory arrives as taste of wet slate, not weather report. Syntax lengthens in catacomb gloom, then shortens above ground—rhythm mirrors ascent. No dialogue to distort voice; Dr. Okafor’s single line is reported, keeping focalization pure. Register stays within her plausible lexicon—no academic gloss on Ala or gnomon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “roots threading ribcages like fingers lacing” fuses three jobs—image, stakes, tenderness—in one sweep. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances soil, bone, or memory. Metaphors stay physically coherent—wooden palms actually cradle skulls. Final paragraph’s breath-slowing sentence replicates the shadow’s patience without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of arboriculture, ossuary, and horology; diaspora-return arc is familiar but re-rooted through mineral-floral sweetness and reciprocal warmth. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but specificity of Nri cosmogony plus smith-forged gnomon keeps it from template. Could push further if colonial rupture had an on-page antagonist voice.</comment>
