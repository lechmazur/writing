<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is lean but specific—her habit of reading absence instead of presence is shown twice (drone feed, matrix gaps) and drives the climax. Davu’s perpetual-surprise trait is used to justify his odd navigation method and creates a micro-status shift on the platform. The earned stasis lands because her earlier competence-with-loneliness is quietly foreclosed by the shared frequency; the trembling hands are a small but visible cost. No moral balancing or therapy-speak; both remain flawed, distinct, and believable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the frequency reweights the entire quest from “code to crack” to “birthright to share,” with undeniable conceptual cost—she can no longer claim outsider expertise. The causal chain is clean: chip → ratio → 194.18 Hz → reframing. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are in by line 3; no ambiguity. The persistent constraint is that the tone must be experienced collectively, which immediately shrinks her solitary identity—felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The dome-split-like-skull image teaches the fractured-yet-whole motif early; the drone’s thermal feed turns the mosaic floor into a living text that later mirrors the joined chips. Star trails and dusk light are not postcard prettiness—they are the literal path Davu walked and the clock that forces the hand-off before full night. The final image reuses the cracked dome now “breathing,” tying setting to the reopened circle. Environment thus supplies both the ancient rule-set and the final charged visual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the eighth chip complete a usable message?”—is signaled in paragraph two. The tightening beat is the click-home moment: options narrow from “missing data” to “shared vibration,” forcing her stance to shift from observer to participant. Cost is visible: trembling hands plus the unspoken forfeiture of her monopoly on absence-reading. Under causal lens, one meaningful escalation is sufficient; the story delivers it cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: distributed meaning beats centralized knowledge. The missing-pieces motif flips from scarcity to generosity at the exact beat the frequency is sounded, reweighting prior material. No moral is declared; the resonance is in the image of two tiny figures inside a cracked dome now audibly alive. The emotional aftereffect is a hush rather than a lesson—earned by concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual filter—thermal palette, frequency numbers, loneliness rendered as professional habit. Sentence rhythm tightens under pressure: fragments when the tone locks in (“Her hands trembled.”). No head-hopping; Davu’s interior is guessed at only through his surprised eyebrows—clean POV hygiene. Distinct idiom in “brilliant dimness” and “frequency of belonging” without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or sensory layer. Metaphors (skull dome, tuning-fork character) are sparse, coherent, and payoff-linked. opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “brilliant dimness.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dusk tempo—no algorithmic cadence. Copy is clean; no typos or homophone slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “ancient-code” trope by making the answer a felt vibration rather than a translated sentence. The drone-pilot-plus-pilgrim pairing is unexpected yet plausible, and the star-trail navigation method is specific enough to feel discovered, not borrowed. Transformation test fails: if you swap the frequency for another MacGuffin, the emotional arc still works—hence not a 9+. Nevertheless, the synthesis of observatory acoustics and distributed anti-individualism feels non-obvious and well-grounded.</comment>
