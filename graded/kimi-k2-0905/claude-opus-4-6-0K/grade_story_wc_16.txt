<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—devotion to dead languages versus ache for her sister—remains palpable in every micro-gesture with the Venetian ink well. The six-linked promise structure externalizes her arcane training and makes the final risk credible. Emotional embodiment is strong, but the sister stays off-page, so status dynamics and voice distinction bullets are N/A. The letter’s composition is the single, cost-bearing choice; its outcome is uncontested, so the “change” is modestly rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elara leaves tomorrow, therefore Maren writes—each promise tightens the knot she must either complete or break. Closure is a Charged Poise: the letter leaves the archive, re-weighting both futures with unguaranteed cost. One small causality wobble: the narrative never questions whether the ink-well theft could jeopardize her new post, a stakes-blind spot that mildly thins the cost picture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Extinct Language Archive is sketched with economical sensory cues—vaulted dark, lamp-breath on glass, phonetic ghosts—functioning as both shrine and cage. Micro-setting dominance: the Venetian ink well’s “milky striations like frozen breath” becomes the tactile anchor that keeps her “honest,” constraining how hard she presses the pen. Spatial tracking is flawless; no orientation debt. For 9+ the room would need to push back (shelf denial, curatorial rule) but it stays passive; hence sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation before departure—is signaled early and tightened promise-by-promise; each new clause forecloses retreat. Escalation is incremental: silence → first sentence → full covenant; cost is emotional exposure rather than external jeopardy. Agency is pure (she could stop at any line) and luck absent, satisfying lens. Physical price (job risk) is hinted but not dramatized, capping tension just under the visceral band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—translation as reconciliation, silence as dead language—emerges through craft rather than thesis: the Hittite covenant syntax becomes the story’s own. Subtext operates in gesture (returning the ink well “with the tenderness of someone returning a borrowed heartbeat”). Final image re-prices hope without moralizing. No motif recycling for artificial resonance; every echo (archive hush / sister hush) is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrally precise, scholarly diction (“phonemic decay patterns,” “emotional geometries”) stays inside Maren’s professional lexicon, never show-off. Rhythm swells and contracts with sentence length, mirroring the polyphonic metaphor. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Filter verbs are scarce; the one “she realized” is buried mid-stream and harmless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density—almost every sentence layers metaphor, information, and motion; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent (ink well = borrowed heartbeat) rather than mixed. One tiny scaffold—“she began not with an apology but with a promise” could compress to “she began with a promise”—but it is isolated and outside the closure beat. Opening and closing lines hit exact image targets without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sister-silence decoded via extinct-language philology feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk resides in static scene / reflection-heavy structure; it succeeds because the covenant device delivers motion. Some tropes (precious ink well, under-ground archive) are familiar, but specificity of the Hittite interlocking-oath mechanic transforms them. Without that cultural granularity the concept would slide toward template.</comment>
