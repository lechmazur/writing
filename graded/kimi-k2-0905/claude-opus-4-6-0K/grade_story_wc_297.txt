<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sable’s interiority is concrete and botanist-specific; the moment she presses the clipping to her scar and feels “vegetal voltage” is a perfect embodied beat. Motivation stays rooted in her root-obsession, but the leap from urban botanist to cosmic translator is asserted more than dramatized; we’re told she is “purposefully curious” rather than shown a prior micro-choice that proves it. The final endurance—stepping into the breathing maze—carries visible cost and is consistent with her established hunger for hidden networks, so the arc earns its Renunciation/Earned Stasis. Flaws compound rather than being confronted, satisfying the no-tidy-resolution standard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze rises, the scars sing, and Sable commits to “mending what had been eclipsed,” a Charged Poise that reweights all prior imagery. Causal linkage holds under a Hybrid (Cumulative-Situational) lens: each scar coordinate is a “because” that lands her in the glade, while the accumulating vegetal hum deepens texture until the stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“cobalt glade at dusk”), well inside the 120-word window. The only slack is the off-page jump from botanist to chosen translator—no on-page event forces that upgrade, so motivation is slightly telegraphed rather than proven in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is rendered through botanical perception—light the color of “bruised sapphires,” birch-filtered dusk—so every sensory choice is filtered through Sable’s professional bias. Spatial choreography is flawless: the maze starts knee-high, then “rises to shoulder height” exactly as the clipping is grafted to her arm, so environment and body co-evolve. The glade’s refusal to appear on satellites is not just texture; it directly enables the privacy needed for the covenant reboot, thus constraining tactics and charging the final image. World logic stays consistent: vegetal voltage, bioluminescent veins, and breathing hedges all obey the story’s fungal-internet rule-set.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent total dissolution of the human–green covenant—is signaled early and tightened when the maze literally grows shut behind her, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is driven by her own agency: she chooses to graft the clipping to her scar, a single beat that flips the maze from static relic to living lock-in. Cost is legible on the page: she loses ordinary escape routes and accepts a lifetime of “radical mending.” Under the Hybrid lens the pressure coheres; coincidence (early Convergence) complicates but does not resolve the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the story equates root networks and digital networks, letting the vegetal voltage image carry the insight. Subtext operates in silence—no human speaks after paragraph one; the only “dialogue” is chemical whispering beneath soil, a nice inversion of tech-singularity chatter. The final image of leaf-thin boundary between minds offers a resonant, non-moral answer. The single risk is near-echo of “dreaming of trees and dreaming of people” line, which flirts with thematic echo, but cadence and context feel earned rather than标语.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is botanist-poetic: “chemical languages older than speech,” “fungal pasts,” syntax always sliding toward vegetal metaphor. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—paragraph six is almost breathless list, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue appears, so no convergence risk. The clipped, parallel openings (“She understood… She felt… She pressed…”) are deliberate patterning, paid off when the same cadence returns in the final sentence, now inside the maze. Perceptual signature is distinct and stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet never purple: “the hum of roots communicating across vast distances” packs three jobs—sound, scale, metaphor—into eleven words. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language is disciplined: “bruised sapphires” is the only adjective pair in the entire piece, used at a low-pressure moment. Opening and closing lines are sonic mirrors (“The future arrived… / …one breath at a time”), creating purposeful bookends without drum-beat monotony. Clean grammar, zero typos, high read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cli-fi and mythic fantasy through a botanist’s lens—fresh synthesis, not stock singologue. Scar-as-map and vegetal key are specific inventions; remove either and the plot collapses, passing the transformation test. Risky second-person future arrival opener is justified by immediate payoff. The quiet ending resists blockbuster spectacle, choosing fungal over fireworks—a bold stance that intensifies thematic credibility. Only fractional deduction for faint echoes of ubiquitous “trees communicate” pop-science trope, but the piece personalizes it through Sable’s scars.</comment>
