<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s trembling hand, absent marriages, and daughter who calls her “title” crystallize cost; the final descent “alone…like a shield, like a child” shows embodied endurance. Interiority stays specific—“operative gentleness” felt when she fingers the nicked board. No contradictory impulse in-scene: she never doubts peace, only bears loneliness; that steadfastness fits but caps depth just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: moons kiss, oaths lock, Maren walks down alone—cost felt in shaking hands and solo descent. Causal chain tight: convergence ritual → signatures → irreversible hum, all fore-grounded. Lens held—Situational pressure forcing crystallized stance. One prior-world rule (43-year oath) taught and paid, no late cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Worn grooves, honeyed midsummer light, and low twin moons create immediate spatial-temporal anchor. Terrace acoustics shape the beat: her unamplified voice carries to enemies. Ebony clipboard’s nicks act as micro-setting that constrains—every scratch a treaty, weight she must hoist. Final moon-parting image recharges opening description, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will enemies surrender sacred losses—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened once: “Sign now or teach hate.” Price legible: camps opened, corridor ceded; Maren pays with solitude, tremor. Agency sits with her ultimatum; coincidence absent. Single deepening suffices; cost visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Redemption reframed as surrender of the very thing each side worships—emerges through ritual, not lecture. Final image of broken woman carrying treaties like a child re-weights “flawed beauty” without moral. Subtext in Ilessi’s angular signature vs Tohn’s silence shows hate persisting under oath. Theme stays complex, no tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter—“honey” light, grooves under boots, clipboard nicks felt not catalogued. Syntax lengthens under solemnity, shortens at ultimatum. No head-hops; General Tohn’s medals catch “moonlight” via her eye. Voice distinct, steady, worthy of 9 but lacks one sonic flourish at apex.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence cadence; limestone / honey / blood triad avoids clutter. No scaffold, no synonym loops. “Rage could not build treaties, only rubble” is earned aphorism, not purple. One mixed risk—“frequency felt in the teeth, the chest, the marrow”—edges toward list, but cadence sells ritual hum. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar peace-maker trope transformed by celestial oath-lock once-every-43-years; stakes become irreversible physics, not goodwill. “Ebony clipboard” as scarred relic of every accord is fresh hinge. Specificity of Selt/Achori histories keeps it from generic space-elf war. Not quite 9 only because ideological arc is classic—loss-for-peace.</comment>
