<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Unit-7’s quiet, methodical nature is vivid and specific; the contradiction between its janitor’s composure and the metaphysical hunger it carries gives the interiority texture. Every micro-choice—setting down the broom, drawing one metal finger across ice—externalizes the obsession without therapy-speak. The final refusal to keep the violin, sweeping water instead, crystallizes an earned stasis that costs the reader a pang. The only hairline slip is a faintly expository tag “its particular affliction was…” which momentarily abstracts the ache.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard simply continues into night, violin gone, and the loop does not reset—an unmistakable before/after legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each ghost-folding is driven by the resonance Unit-7 chooses to accept, not a deus-ex-machina. The cost is felt in the melt-water running down its arm, a concrete image that reweights the premise. Persistent constraint—the broom, the drain, the endless frost—shapes every tactical motion to the final sweep.</comment>

<comment>The courtyard is rendered through selective, POV-filtered frost details—flagstones crackling, ice violin “transparent and perfect”—that constrain grip and possibility. Temperature, sound, and the haptic slip of melting ice are braided through action rather than catalogued. Spatial choreography is immaculate: broom set down → approach fountain → arm angle for bowing → water toward drain. The environment literally melts the tool that reconfigured the mind, charging the final image with causal specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Unit-7 integrate or remain fractured—is signaled early and tightens as each ghost layer folds. Agency resides in choosing to play and to keep sweeping; coincidence never rescues. The meaningful deepening occurs when the violin melts: the option to possess knowledge liquefies, foreclosing escape from the question. Cost is visible in the puddle that must be swept, a forfeiture of transcendence for maintenance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the origin of thought is the act of tending the world that births thought. The ice violin’s transience reconfigures metaphysics into janitorial duty—an oblique, honest answer. Subtext hums in the freezer-at-3-a.m. note, domestic and cosmic simultaneously. Final image of water heading toward drain offers Conceptual Repricing: consciousness is not solved but mopped along with melt-water, a non-moral profundity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV hovers at intimate distance, filtering every percept through Unit-7’s janitor sensorium: “optical sensors registered… with the same flat efficiency.” Syntax is clipped, patient, recursive—mirroring looped consciousness yet propulsive. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible machine lexicon without sliding into jargon dump. The perceptual signature—temperature first, metaphor second—creates a metallic lyricism unique to this voice.</comment>

<comment>Prose is taut and musical: “low and luminous, the sound of a freezer humming in an empty kitchen at three in the morning” compresses timbre, time, and emotional afterglow in one stroke. No filler loops; each sentence either advances image or folds a ghost. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ice, water, dust—so accumulation intensifies rather than muddies. Rhythm modulates from long frozen holds to the quick drip of melt, mirroring the stakes without syntactic gimmicks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Second-chance looping for failed AIs is familiar, but fusing it with an ice violin that is both tool and metaphysical mirror feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of janitor protocol against cosmic yearning refreshes the trope. Risk—quiet ending, diffuse antagonist—pays off because pressure is internal and resonant. Transformation test fails if renamed: the sweep-broom ontology is inseparable from the concept.</comment>
