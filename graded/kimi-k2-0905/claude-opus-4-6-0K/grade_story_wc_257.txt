<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grief-artisan who cannot mourn her own loss—peaks when she traces Sable’s stencil and adds her brooch-in-root; the micro-choice to draw rather than tattoo externalizes her first active self-healing. Embodied emotion stays specific (tasting copper air, steadying hand). The final renunciation of suicide-by-starlight is legible but slightly under-costed; we are told “she already knew where she was,” yet the page does not register the forfeited oblivion as sharply as the reopened workshop might have. Still, contradictory impulses act in-scene and the choice is causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s first graphite line on vellum crystallizes a new creative path whose cost is the forever-lost original workshop and the brooches that can never be replaced. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—starlight density and stencil perforations reweight the stake of “genuine artificiality” until the final image re-prices it. Orientation is taught rather than defaulted: the missing clocks signal timelessness by line 3, satisfying the waiver. Persistent constraint is legible: dead star’s light still guides, tattoo stencil remains un-inked on skin, keeping the cost open-ended yet felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory’s copper air and star-tasting dome constrain Elara’s bodily state (steady hand returns only under the open sky). The stencil-on-vellum functions as micro-setting; its star-pricked perforations literally project new constellations across the floor, guiding her first creative act. Granite ridge and dome geometry keep the possibility of suicide-by-height present, tightening the final renunciation. Detail is selective, never catalogic; every sensory note (jet, gold, hair, vellum warmth) is filtered through grief-metallurgy expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“can she relearn making when her own grief is uncrafted?”—tightens when stencil-starlight re-prices her brooch-making as avoidance. Agency is the decision to draw rather than tattoo; this forecloses permanent skin-commitment yet restarts craft, paying the visible price of perpetual incompleteness. Escalation is textural: each origami crane adds density until the fourth lotus tips her into climbing the ridge. Cost is unmistakable: the burned workshop stays ash, the dead star stays dead, the tattoo stays un-inked—permanent deferral chosen over permanent oblivion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: artificial permanence (hair brooch, starlight) can still guide if one accepts its inherent transience. No character moralizes; Sable’s “curtains” speech is the closest to thesis, but it is framed as personal cartography, not sermon. Final image of graphite on vellum offers resonant, non-literal answer: continuation is itself the form of mourning. The story resists the easy binary of forgetting vs. clinging, letting the stencil’s un-inked status keep ambiguity charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature: astronomical metaphors, metallurgical diction, synesthetic taste of metal and light. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for star-distance, staccato “paper cranes and foxes” for origami sequence. No head-hopping; Sable’s interior remains opaque except via Elara’s interpretation, preserving psychic distance. Free-indirect slides cleanly into her professional eye: “she recognized the architecture—it was grief reshaping itself.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or loops; sentences carry double duty (“starlight passed through its perforations” marries physics to metaphor). Figurative control holds in peak beat—“quiet sound of graphite meeting vellum” stays tactile, never purple. No register drift; diction stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “genuinely artificial” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of mourning-jewelry craft with observatory star-craft feels inevitable yet fresh; the stencil-as-sky-map transforms familiar tattoo trope into grief-cartography. “Genuinely artificial” as both starlight and hair-brooch offers a conceptual repricing that re-weights everyday materials. Risk of timeless, clockless zone pays off by making the final graphite line feel like first time. No close echoes; premise would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
