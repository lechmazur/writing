<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable’s lone, embodied grief is specific—she names each tone, catalogs loss through bone-on-wood. Interior contradiction pulses: clinging to a relic while composing forward motion. The final palm-to-trunk micro-choice crystallizes her earned, costly refusal to surrender the raft-instrument. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each struck object layers density until the orchard itself becomes a resonant vessel. Closure delivers Charged Poise—“she chose a branch of the chord”—with felt cost: the perpetual, unpeaceful electricity of staying alive. Orientation taught by drifted orchard image at word ~40; no penalty. Persistent constraint (floating ruin) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to the raft’s spine-beam, rusted bolts, trailing root; every part is tapped for pitch, so environment directly constrains compositional tactics. Salt-stunted fig, brine whisper, and indigo bruise sky filter through Sable’s prophet-trained attention. Spatial choreography remains clean as she circles and strikes. Final mango-trunk touch recharges the living instrument, locking setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she convert wreckage into meaning before atmospheric convergence swamps her—is signaled early via spiral-cloud omen. Escalation comes through density: each new tone annexes a physical fragment, narrowing escape options to “compose or drown.” No antagonist needed; sea and sky supply coherent pressure. Cost is the restless, unpeaceful vigil she must keep forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: creation as survival—loss reframed into instrument, obstacle into music. No overt statement; meaning accrues through tonal naming (Foundation, Arch, Hinge) and the final chord-branch choice. Ambiguity lingers: will any shore answer? Resonant reconfiguration charges the ending without moralizing. Subtext resides in bone mallet—death repurposed into agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains perceptual signature: prophet’s synesthetic ear hears clouds as “sketched resonance,” feels harmonics “in molars.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for spiral contemplation, staccato fragments when she strikes faster. No head-hopping; distance remains steady. Compression (“fractal generating,” “blue hour”) is taught early and paid off in closing chord-branch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory data while advancing the composition. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors (nautilus clouds, bruise sky) stay coherent. Filter verbs minimal; actions rendered in strong verbs—“struck,” “threading,” “shivered.” Only hairline slip: “particular electricity of things refusing to be still” edges toward abstraction, but resonates with prior build.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating orchard-as-instrument, bone mallet, cloud-reading composer-prophet—specific synthesis feels inevitable and fresh. Premise commits fully: world logic obeys resonance physics, never explained away. Risk of lyric abstraction accepted and paid off in tangible final chord-branch. Transformation test fails if parts swapped; the concept is inseparable from this voice and vessel.</comment>
