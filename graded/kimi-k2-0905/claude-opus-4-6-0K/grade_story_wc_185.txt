<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Seren’s vocation-driven stubbornness is viscerally embodied; her decision to stay feels inevitable yet costly. The single contradictory impulse—comfort in noise she alone can parse—rides every beat. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final renunciation (new map instead of escape) is earned and forecloses alternatives with visible fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: migrant hum → cave fracture → silence-map → counter-song → bloom of hush. Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: quiet achieved but perpetual vigilance implied (“began a new map”). Cost is legible in bodily wear and the open-ended guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave acoustics are not backdrop but tactical terrain: ripple marks, ice fracture lexicon, and the negation chamber actively constrain method and outcome. Echo-chamber stone operates as mobile micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory choice mirrors POV—sound over sight—keeping details vocation-filtered and urgent. Spatial choreography stays clean through vertical descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominate stake—preserve cave integrity by finding silence—signaled early and tightens once: discovery of convergent silence-veins forces one-shot conjure with no fallback. Escalation is causal narrowing, not multiplicity of reversals. Price paid: bodily exhaustion, indefinite stewardship. Coincidence limited to initial migration; all resolution flows from Seren’s mapped counter-song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “stillness inside cataclysm” emerges through iterated acoustic images rather than statement. Final sheet of mica reweights all prior maps as provisional, enacting conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext in ice-cracks-as-language keeps idea tangible. Ambiguity remains: silence is bought, not natural, leaving ethical aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Seren’s perceptual filter; diction stays geologic and sonic, never drifts into generic fantasy register. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“She descended.”) then widens in the still chamber, mirroring stakes. No head-hop or POV leakage. Elisions (“She began to conjure.”) are taught by prior exposition, paid off in bloom of hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—information and atmosphere—without overcrowding. Figurative layer is spare and acoustically apt (“bloom of hush”). No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“fractured,” “boiled,” “distilled”) keep propulsion. Clause variety handles exposition without stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Mapkeeper who weaponizes silence” is fresh synthesis of geomythic and hard-SF resonance. Energy migrants refracted through geologic acoustics avoids invasion cliché. Pattern of mapping → obsolete → remap provides non-obvious arc. Specificity of crack-reading as sonic linguism feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
