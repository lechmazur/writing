<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s survivor-guilt motive is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to touch the bark crystallizes the arc. The interior contradiction—needing a cure yet fearing extraction—stays alive until she accepts witness over theft. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a. Cost is understated but legible in the final image: she pilots away emptied, carrying the frequency inside her ribs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: water-river pattern teaches the logic early; inversion deepens rather than reverses. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the arrow-in-tree image reweights resilience from cure to incorporation. Cost is undeniable: she forecloses the extraction path and accepts lifelong “hum.” Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating-arch orchard is not backdrop but navigation system; water-ribbons constrain every flight move. Micro-setting object = the glowing-fruit tree whose trunk width swallows her skiff, forcing the final approach. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot priorities: mineral scent, engine vibration, reversed river glints. Final image of arrow swallowed by bark reuses the embedded-metal detail to charge the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—witness resilience, not harvest it—tightens when inversion catapults her to the hollow: witness becomes visceral confrontation. Protagonist agency: she chooses to approach and touch the tree, accepting the cost of non-extraction. No external antagonist; pressure is situational gravity and moral choice. Cost legible: she pilots home empty-handed, frequency implanted as permanent reminder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image-pattern: wound not removed but grown-around. Subtext resides in silence—echoes of unspoken growth—rather than articulated thesis. Final image re-prices resilience as incorporation of injury, not escape from it. avoids moralizing; resonance built from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s pilot sensorium; perceptual signature—“felt in teeth,” “rivers read like thermals”—is distinct. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under inversion. Rhythm modulates: long aerial sentences stretch, then staccato moment of touch. No dialogue, so voice purity maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often handles setting, motion, and metaphor—“threading her skiff between floating rock arches that rose like the ribs of some ancient, buried god.” No loops or scaffold; figurative vehicles stay consistent (ribs, cathedrals, pollen). Final line cadence mirrors the internalized hum. One passive clause (“the tree had grown”) is justified as past-perfect recap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of arboriculture + planetary physics + emotional quest; inversion-hour rule is non-obvious yet fully grounded. Arrow-in-tree image transforms resilience trope into living metallurgy. Risky lyric compression paid off by closure reweighting. Premise is inseparable from character need—extracting resilience vs embodying it—so passes transformation test.</comment>
