<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve every unspoken word yet choosing to release most—plays out in concrete micro-choices (tearing pages, syncing heartbeat to watch). Embodied emotion is strong: “Elara wept as she documented them” shows felt cost. Motivation arcs cleanly from childhood dream to custodial renunciation, but the decision moment is narrated rather than dramatized in full sensorium, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the four retained pages + backward watch crystallize a new custodial stance whose cost is the library she walks away from. Causal chain holds—each reversed tick translates to decipherable text that cumulatively forces the final triage. Propagation-delay mechanic is taught early and constrains tactics throughout. No orientation debt; “who/where/when” fixed by line 4. One of the few stories where withholding most documents feels inevitable, not convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-locked amber library functions as micro-setting that literally filters what can be read; fog density decides which shelves glow, hence which words Elara can access. Sensory triangulation—honeyed light, wet ink, half-second-delayed ticks—grounds spatial choreography. Watch-as-tool is tactile: “mechanism tick against her palm” links body to decoding rhythm. Environment doesn’t merely backdrop; its luminous opacity forces her selective-documentation tactic, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find then curate unspoken words—tightens when discovery reveals infinite volume impossible to carry. Mid-story reversal: abundance shifts goal from collection to editorial selection. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each 49-tick cycle layers denser emotional cargo until silence itself becomes unbearable weight. Cost is legible in the torn pages that vanish into mist, foreclosing perfect archive; visible forfeiture could be sharper (e.g., one dissolving page shown line-by-line) for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges tacitly: curation over possession, silence as generative seed. Subtext resides in gesture—feeding pages to mist enacts the idea that some absences fertilize future speech. No moralizing line intrudes; final image of “seeds waiting for the right delay” reweights earlier cipher delays into living metaphor. Complexity retained: documenting nothing equals erasure, documenting everything equals banality, partial release is painful yet fertile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “propagation delays, she thought” maintains lexicon of a pattern-seeker. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences in discovery, staccato note-taking beats under pressure. No head-hop; postman’s neutrality stays external. Syntax mirrors reversed time: periodic clauses loop back on themselves, reinforcing watch mechanic without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge (“books lined every surface, but their pages were blank to ordinary sight”). Figurative language is selective—three metaphors across 800 words, each re-used (“mist,” “amber,” “delay”) for pattern cohesion, avoiding purple drift. No loops or synonym churn; pronoun clarity clean. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by seed image that recharges prior “delay” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses reversed-time pocket watch with library of never-uttered sentences—fresh synthesis rather than trope tick-box. Cipher decoded via acoustic lag rather than visual key upends expectation. Risk taken in off-stage destruction of 7 pages pays off by leaving reader with curated absence that feels full. Concept commits fully; no late rule changes or safety hedging.</comment>
