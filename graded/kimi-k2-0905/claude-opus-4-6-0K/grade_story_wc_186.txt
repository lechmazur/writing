<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret’s custodian solitude and retrocognitive gift are vividly particular; her nightly ritual of touching glass and whispering dead languages embodies the bleak vocation. The moment she kneels under the prism’s vision, then chooses to chart stars with a dead astronomer’s mind, crystallizes a believable arc from observer to actor. Yet the interior contradiction—does she guard the past or betray it by lighting a futile beacon—stays latent; a sharper internal tug-of-war on the tower stair could have earned the last increment. Still, her flawed persistence against cosmic indifference feels lived-in and costs her the comfort of certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each nightly circuit, pencil mark, and spectral ribbon layers density until the “shard of hush” completes a pattern that reweights the stake from duty to possibility. The reveal that the prism was intentionally cracked is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with conceptual cost—every prior humming note now reads as a designed absence. The final coordinate emerges organically from the accumulated annotations; no new rule is introduced. A hairline deduction for the slightly late anchoring of the coastal ridge’s geography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is protagonist: the glass pavilion’s acoustic ribs, wind-tuned frequencies, and annotated grease-pencil web constrain every micro-choice. The beacon-tower ledge, a micro-setting, literally refracts the prism’s dark line across the narrative, charging the final image. Sensory economy is ruthless—only tactile glass, spectral color, and salt wind are allowed to matter. The setting’s sonic silence at climax is the knife-edge on which hope balances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether empty ritual can regain meaning—tightens when the shard’s alignment stops the hum, forcing Maret to wager her custodian identity on an ocean coordinate. Pressure is felt as physical silence; the pavilion itself withholds its voice until she accepts the cost of possible delusion. No coincidence resolves; instead, the universe’s rhyme is revealed as a deliberately engineered gap. The price is the collapse of her defensive cynicism—she must now wait vulnerably for a reply that may never come.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between random survival and designed signal: the story refuses to declare whether the coordinate is cosmic plan or human projection, letting the ambiguity thistle-burr in the reader. The prism’s intentional crack reframes every shattered pane of civilization as potential instrument rather than debris. Subtext resides in silence—when the humming ceases, the absence itself argues that meaning can be manufactured from ruin. Final image of “hope… stubborn and spined” avoids moralizing; it is an organic weed grown from specific glass, salt, and star particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly Maret’s: wind-chime syntax, coastal salt in diction, and a cadence that mimics the pavilion’s own glassy resonance. Perceptual signature—she tastes centuries-old smoke, hears star-paths, sees silence as a dark finger—never leaks into committee exposition. Compression is taught early (“dust… dust… fragments”) and paid off in the final thistle metaphor. Register remains within the plausible lexicon of a solitary keeper who talks to dead languages; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose performs glasswork: every sentence either advances annotation, refracts light, or records star-position; paraphrase loops are absent. Metaphors are physically loyal—wind “sings,” silence is a “shard,” hope is a “weed through cracked stone”—so imagery coheres without purple drift. Rhythm modulates from long humming sentences to the staccato of grease-pencil ticks, mirroring escalation. One hairline slip: “thistledown notes” edges on precious, but the agricultural specificity of thistle as coastal weed saves it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The post-collapse star-message device is familiar, yet the fusion of acoustic architecture, synesthetic retrocognition, and calibrated silence feels freshly engineered. Risk is taken by making the climax a literal silence rather than an action set-piece; the payoff is conceptual rather than spectacular, and it works. The broken prism as intentionally cracked instrument transforms salvage trope into epistemic tool. Specificity of “hand-drawn charts” and “hexagonal shaft” roots the concept in tactile detail that reskins the template.</comment>
