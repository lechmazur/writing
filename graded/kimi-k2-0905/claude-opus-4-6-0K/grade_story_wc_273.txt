<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sable’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—uncapping ink, timing the eclipse, trembling hands—so the interior engine never stalls. The final shift from “burning coal” to “light” is prepared by the ink’s fade-rate and the memory of her brother’s fall; the cost is the eleven-year solitude she will never get back. Only the “serene anger” label approaches diagnostic shorthand, but it is immediately re-grounded in sensory memory. Voice and action stay fused; no competence overreach; the renunciation feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink’s vanishing figure re-weights time itself—attention as the last defense against erasure—felt cost is the irreversibility of her brother’s unwitnessed final instant. Causal lens holds throughout: eclipse jolt → ink trials → perceptual dilation → re-priced grief. Orientation is taught by line 6 (“wind-carved encampment”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the hummingbird, vials, and canyon all track cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon’s spiral wind is not backdrop; it dictates ink behavior, drone flight, and the metaphoric logic of time stretching along sandstone whorls. Micro-setting supremacy: three glass vials and a flat rock become the entire laboratory, constraining every experimental move. Eclipse light is filtered through albino sensitivity, so “too golden” is simultaneously physics and character wound. Final ink figure dissolves into the same wind that carved the shelters—setting re-enters the image and charges it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single stake—compulsion to witness—tightens when the third-stage ink pattern triggers perceptual crisis, narrowing options from “solve grief” to “accept witnessing as enough.” Escalation is internal but legible: each vial poured raises the cognitive stakes until the third reveals the falling silhouette; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible: time lost, solitude accrued, illusion of control surrendered. Coincidence absent; eclipse merely provides controlled experimental catalyst.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: attention is the only mortal antidote to erasure. The disappearing ink motif reprises at the close as the falling brother, fusing concept and emotion without thematic statement. No moralizing; the reader is left holding the same unstable present Sable finally accepts. Ambiguity is meaningful—she gains insight yet remains alone—so complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Sable’s perceptual warp: barometric data, fractal linger, colorless glare against too-gold sun. Syntax lengthens during dilation—comma-rich cadence mimics stretched seconds—and contracts at release. No head-hop; drone optics remain her optic. Diction (“calcified,” “excruciating frame-by-frame clarity”) belongs to a mind that has counted sand grains for eleven years.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty—image + motion + emotional calculus—without syntactic monotony. Only micro-loop: “formed and dissolved, formed and dissolved” is purposeful pattern reinforcement, not scaffold. Metaphors stay internally consistent (glass, cathedral, coal) and culminate in light. Zero filter-verb clusters; zero register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Using disappearing ink as a chronometer for subjective time dilation is conceptually fresh and emotionally specific; no genre template duplicated. Risk of lyric repetition is embraced and paid off when the ephemeral figure becomes her brother. Albino tracker in wind-sculpted lab feels inevitable, not quirky. The synthesis of hard-science eclipse data with grief mysticism creates a singular stance.</comment>
