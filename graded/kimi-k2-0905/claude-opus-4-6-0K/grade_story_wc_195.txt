<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; the knight’s withdrawal and subsequent vow feel anchored in embodied sensation. The final renunciation—letting the gorget fall—carries visible cost, but the causality between tracing the pattern and the cosmic shift is slightly abstract, muting the stakes of his choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration crystallized in the image of him reaching for the fruit, armor already discarded. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the night-deepening and fruit pulsing reweight possibility with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; the greenhouse and no-dawn rule are signaled within 70 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse, mercury-veined trees, and the copper irrigation channels constrain movement and supply the only light, directly feeding the final gesture. The gorget becomes micro-setting: its dropped “bell-struck-underwater” sound charges the silence-turned-fertility motif. Every sensory pick is filtered through Edric’s monkish attention, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“to capture the shape of possibility”—are declared early and tighten when the diagrams activate reality flux. One meaningful deepening suffices: the night peels back unlived timelines, foreclosing naive withdrawal. Agency sits in the unsnapping and the whispered vow; cost is the irreversible stepping-off from knightly identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibility versus fixed destiny emerges from the spiral trees and recursive fruit, never sermonized. Final image reconfigures silence from retreat into generative dark, answering the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext in the puppet diagrams hints that reality itself is a marionette—an elegant conceptual re-pricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is dense, medieval-alchemical, yet remains inside Edric’s perceptual range; compressed syntax mirrors his ascetic withdrawal. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato beats for the gorget drop. No head-hopping; lyric elision is taught early and repaid in the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are tightly welded to physics—“bell struck underwater”—and rarely overstacked. One scaffold loop: “darkness behind darkness” borders paraphrase, but it lands inside the accumulative pattern, not at closure. Line density is high; each sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines knight-errant, alchemy, and puppet-theory into a singular cosmology; the diagrams-as-strings feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky endless-night greenhouse setup pays off by turning withdrawal into generative cosmos-seeding. Specific detail—copper channels, mercury-pomegranate hybrids—prevents generic fantasy gloss.</comment>
