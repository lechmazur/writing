<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s “steadily adaptive” trait is dramatized through frost-reading and ledger-decoding micro-choices; the renunciation of revenge is foreshadowed by her glass-maker patience and carries felt cost in the closing “broken-then-beautiful” image. Interiority stays concrete and glass-specific (“molten silica until colors sang”). No contradictory impulses are shown *in scene*, only summarized, keeping her just shy of 9-band interior contradiction. The final stance is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns and ledger fragments thicken until they reweight the dominant stake—purpose found in pauses, not revenge. Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks on without deciding, but the cost (her past self burned away, the ledgers’ truth unread) is legible in the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “she had always…” opener is template cadence, but it does not touch the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and sandstone pores constrain every move; frost thickness literally maps smugglers’ water veins, guiding her feet and decoding. The charcoal bundles’ hiding place behind a carved symbol is tactile and specific. Micro-setting (the ledger strip held to stars) recharges the closure image. Environment is not just atmosphere but GPS and codebook.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—purpose vs. revenge—tightens when frost-reading forecloses the revenge path by revealing the *second* ledger; the price is the surrender of violent justice. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn adds frost knowledge that eventually makes inaction the only credible stance. Agency is steady—she *chooses* to keep walking rather than deliver the ledgers. Cost is visible: she forfeits immediate moral payoff for an open path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through frost-and-glass parallelism: transformation requires passing through breakage. No explicit moral; the final image of light through broken glass reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the ledger’s scorched edges—truth literally burned but still readable—carries social cost unspoken. Wisdom is earned: “fragments were enough” arises from specific prior craft experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited glints with glass-maker diction—“molten silica,” “kilns,” “medium demands a different touch”—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm breathes with canyon wind and frost melt; no filter-verb clusters. Compression taught early (“eleven days ago”) is paid off in the twelfth-morning discovery. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; narrative register stays consistent and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances pattern or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay inside glass/frost logic and never collide. Minor template stem “she would…” appears thrice but outside the closure beat. Final line cadence mirrors glass cooling—long sentence, then hard stop—propelling exit momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost-as-codebook is fresh; glass artist turned desert tracker feels inevitable yet unseen. Scorched ledger fragment as “testament” fuses craft trauma with social exposure. Risk is taken: quiet, accumulative structure rejects revenge thriller default. Synthesis of frost crystallography and smuggler cartography is specific, not quirky ornament.</comment>
