<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is shown only once—he “meant to throw the lens away” yet charters a boat—so the interior contradiction is thin, not sustained under pressure. The final rest he “receives” is a resonant renunciation, but the causal bridge is a single elliptical jump rather than a built-up cost sequence. Still, his undertaker vocation and the lens-hum in his molars give a sharp, specific perceptual signature that lifts the score. More embodied micro-choices under water would have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens clicks home, the hum ceases, and Elias breathes in “true stillness” with visible cost—his thirty-year weariness finally settles in his ribs. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pressure deepens through atmospheric density until the final image reweights the premise. The orientation anchor (undertaker, prep room, Tuesday) is clear inside 50 words, so no penalty. One causal gap: the instant he decides to keep the lens is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the score just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The salt-crusted canvas, subsonic hum in molars, and impossible basalt-folded architecture are irreplaceably specific; the lens itself constrains every move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—down past shelf edge, through folded halls, into warm still rotunda—each ecological detail alters Elias’s breathing tempo. The underwater library is not postcard backdrop; its glowing tablets circulate warmth that physically permits the final rest. Micro-setting gate satisfied: the broken lens is the literal tool that re-casts bioluminescence across the ceiling in the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—delivering the lens to grant the drowned city rest—is signaled early and tightens once: the cracked glass aligns with pedestal channels, exhaling centuries of pressure. No reversal or external antagonist is needed; the tightening is atmospheric, the cost the undertaker’s own stored exhaustion crystallizing into stillness. Escalation is accumulative/textural: the hum thickens, architecture folds, water warms, until silence lands. Visible price is legible in the final exhalation, but because Elias does not jeopardize a live alternative path, the score stops just inside the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: stillness is not a service you provide but a gift you are finally allowed to receive. The lens’s shift from distress beacon to pure refracted light reweights the undertaker’s life work from mastery to humility. No moral is declared; the image of broken glass casting slow patterns on stone carries the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—will Elias surface unchanged?—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete and unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is restrained, maritime-funereal: “weight of things that had traveled too far,” “chased stillness,” “quiet conviction that stillness, once granted, should never be revoked.” Diction never exceeds an undertaker’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens under water, mirroring narcosis, then shortens into single-sentence beats at the end: “He breathed.” Purposeful compression taught early (“smelling of deep places”) pays off in the final exhalation. Rhythm control under pressure is near-flawless; one filter-verb cluster (“he felt in his molars”) is the only hairline slip keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world-build, body, and metaphor—without padding: “broken Fresnel lens… catching light in ways that made the walls… shiver.” No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. Metaphors stay coherent within maritime register; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with descent—long sentences sinking, final fragments surfacing into silence. Minor scaffold: “as though the city had threaded itself… as though the pressure… had exhaled” uses parallel anaphora twice; because it serves the hymnal closure beat, penalty is capped at −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—undertaker lured by a subsonic lens to restore an impossible drowned library—feels fresh yet inevitable, synthesizing maritime gothic with folded-space architecture. Tropes (lost city, magical object) are transformed through Elias’s vocational lens: embalming tools become the psychic key to revive an archive. Risk is taken: no dialogue, no surface witness, no antagonist—yet coherence holds. Specificity of bioluminescent organisms tracing untranslatable tablets gives the concept authentic inner life. The final reconfiguration could not occur with any other profession or object, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
