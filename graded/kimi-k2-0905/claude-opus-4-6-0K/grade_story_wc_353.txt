<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied—fingers tracing bark “the way a reader traces braille”—and her micro-choices (carving, waiting, strumming) flow from the symphonically-minded trait. The final silent weep is a credible renunciation that costs her the dream of audible music, earned by prior causal logic. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly too smooth for 9-territory, but the motivation holds and the endurance carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the porcelain-alder pulse rewrites the rule that silence is enemy, and the price—Maren’s wordless tears—felt on the page. Causal lens holds throughout: each carving, each read crack, therefore the final strum. Orientation is anchored within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; ending image is tight and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grove, porcelain insulator, and silvered sculpture function as micro-setting that directly constrains the final action; the porcelain’s node placement is impossible without exact spatial detail. Sensory economy is strong—visual, haptic, and proprioceptive cues braided through action. No credibility slips; weather and spiral grain guide the carving logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create music in silence—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the stress-crack interval discovery narrows options to porcelain+alder fusion. Cost is legible (her tears), but escalation is single-arc rather than layered reversal, keeping it just shy of 8.5+ territory. Agency is protagonist-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularized silence-as-first-movement rather than thesis statement. Subtext resides in the hedgehog’s permission and the porcelain’s ache. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—silence neither wins nor loses, simply re-cast as rest—inviting reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—selective attention to grain, glaze, vibration—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing: varied sentence rhythm, strategic fragments (“She waited.”). No register drift; diction stays within Maren’s artisan lexicon. Compression is taught early (“locked, waiting, needing only the right fracture”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances image or pressure. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors are consistent (silence as rest, cracks as intervals). No mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minorly, two adjectival stacks (“white ceramic bell meant to keep electricity…”) could trim, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—soundless world cured by stress-crack music—is non-obvious synthesis of lutherie and conceptual sculpture. Risk of quiet ending is embraced and pays off. Specificity of siskin alder spiral grain and porcelain glaze prevents generic transfer. Transformation test fails: swap any tree or insulator and the physics collapse—freshness is high.</comment>
