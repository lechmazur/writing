<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her spine “curved like a question mark,” ink-blackened fingers, mist in lungs—yet the final renunciation feels slightly under-causal; the pendant is rejected because the text announces she “understood,” not because prior beats visibly wire that choice to her guardian identity. Still, the ache of dimensional homesickness anchors every beat and the Earned Stasis carries a palpable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of frozen stasis + sensory recursion tightens until the pendant introduces a micro-turn. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—pendant left on the glass bridge, foreclosing escape while re-weighting “waiting” as active home. Cost is legible in the final image: “the waiting was enough.” No orientation debt; transitions are mist-blurs that serve the lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen roses, glass-bridge fountain, mist between topiary—each detail is tactile, temperature-rich, and re-deployed: the fountain later supports the pendant moon. Environment literally constrains both posture and choice; curvature of spine over stone bench is micro-setting as body. Light’s “two boundaries” vs. remembered “three” is anchored to perceptual bias, charging the final refusal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: guard the library vs. flee home. Pendant tightens the fork; refusal dramatizes endurance with visible price (second heartbeat of homesickness remains). Escalation is accumulative—density of frost, waiting, mist—rather than causal chain; suffices under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but one meaningful cadence shift: pendant offered → pendant relinquished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: frozen arcs, unanswered questions, patient erosion. “To make friends with uncertainty” is voiced once, but is earned through sensory struggle rather than asserted. Final image re-prices waiting as habitation; ambiguity lingers without moral tag. Dimensional homesickness is the visceral particular that universalizes the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, compressed diction mirrors the guardian’s feral theorem mind: “the way a theorem is feral when it escapes the textbook.” Syntax coils like her spine—long breathless clauses, em-dash silences. Perceptual signature never slips; no head-hopping. Non-standard grammar (“light had boundaries that you could touch”) is consistent, pattern-taught, and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate—varied sentence lengths, frost-bitten caesuras. Density high: “interiorizing exteriors” does world + emotion in three syllables. One mixed metaphor mid-text (“mist rolled between the topiary like breath between teeth”) barely grazes clarity. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence lands with earned hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Frozen garden + feral librarian + dimensional light boundary is a fresh synthesis; escapes stock post-apocalypse or portal clichés. “Waiting as technology” reframes passivity into epistemic craft. Pendant-as-moon on glass bridge is an image not seen before yet inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual integrity commits fully to lyric stasis without flinching.</comment>
