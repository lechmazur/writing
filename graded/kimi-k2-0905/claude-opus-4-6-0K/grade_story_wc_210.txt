<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s refusal to abandon the Cove is anchored in a single, embodied memory: the amber bottle pressing her hip—an 11-year ache that keeps her present. Her interiority stays concrete (“hands remembered vibration… nose recalled copper”) and culminates in a micro-choice—stripping the first lantern—that visibly costs sweat and splinters. The contradiction between clinging to the past (bottle) and rejecting its magic (well is dead) is held in scene, not summary. Flaw: no secondary character on-page, so status crucible untested; still, solitary endurance is credibly priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the slow layering of sensory memory → harmonic insight → first lantern rebuilt. Closure is a Charged Poise: “It felt like a beginning that had rejected the need to be wished for” reweights the entire premise—magicless creation is now possible. Cost is felt in the silent, aching dock and the lone labor that will take weeks. Orientation clean by line 5; no causal breaks; escalation is density of restored lanterns, not external reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is not backdrop but instrument: torn skins, rusted hooks, hollow swaying shells are the only tools Maren can retune. Micro-setting—the amber bottle—literally constrains every tactic (can’t open it, must resonate it). Sensory hierarchy is alchemist-particular: smell of copper vapor, feel of wire frames, sound of humming new paper. Final image reuses the lanterns as active emitters, not décor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can anything endure without magic? Pressure tightens through accretion: each restored lantern raises the harmonic density, narrowing options to either keep working or surrender. No antagonist; instead, the extinction of wishes is the irreversible constraint. Visible price: blistered hands, dwindling daylight, the silence that “had forgotten song.” Could use one earlier micro-loss (bandage, hunger) to hit 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of alchemy: not transmutation of matter into magic, but of memory into matter. Key reprise—lanterns once carried prayers; now they carry resonance—lets the final image answer the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: the cove’s “throat that had forgotten song” vs. the new faint hum. Avoids explicit thesis; the only near-echo is “reimagine,” quickly buried in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren; perceptual signature is alchemical—attention to wire tension, vapor notes, harmonic frequencies. Syntax flexes from long, clause-heavy memory spirals to hammer-blow shorts: “She stood. She pulled.” No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Compression (“seamless, a solid teardrop…”) is taught early and paid off in the final vibrating paper. Filter verbs minimal; “she tilted” is the only possible micro-filter, immediately justified by physical action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with labor: opening paragraph lingers on spondees (“hollow shells… rusted hooks”) then tightens to staccato beats mirroring manual work. Figurative language is spare—only two metaphors: “throat that had forgotten song” and “seed” for Residuum—both integrated into causality. No loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “she began to conceive” is tell-ish, but immediately dramatized by stripping paper, so momentum recovers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic trope—last keeper of dead magic—made specific through alchemical acoustics: resonance rather than extraction. Fresh inflection: the wishing well’s death is irreversible; victory is acoustic archaeology, not resurrection. Risk of quiet labor narrative is embraced, not hedged; refusal to supply arriving townspeople avoids feel-good symmetry. Conceptual integrity intact: every detail (amber, wire, paper) serves the harmonic premise.</comment>
