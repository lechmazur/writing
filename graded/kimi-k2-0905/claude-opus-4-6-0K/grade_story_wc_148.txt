<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s inherited compulsion to speak impossible truths is the only trait that alters his tactics (he must retrieve the notebook before others narrate the scene). Interiority is concrete (“his breath caught”), but the emotional contradiction—simultaneous dread and relief at vindication—is only implied, not embodied in-scene. The final quiet climb back up is a credible renunciation of his father’s shouting stance, foreclosing the wolf-crier path with visible cost in the copper-stained hands. Still, the father remains more mythic than humanized, so the arc’s full weight lands on Marcus’s body alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the town will demolish Monday, therefore Marcus steals onto the island; because the concrete is cracked, therefore he can reach the cistern; because he lifts the notebook, the dead will soon speak. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—notebook in hand, he renounces shouting and chooses hush as tactic, reconfiguring the Harlan legacy. The cost is legible in the copper-stained palms and the suspended dust that “hovered like witnesses,” making the conceptual price (town’s narrative collapse) undeniable. One micro-turn: lattice grid fragments the corridor, literalizing his fractured worldview just before he cracks the real cover.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse itself is the constraint that dictates every move—spiral stairs force descent, cistern concrete must be cracked, copperlight stains skin and evidence. Salt-softened plaster and brine-copper odor are filtered through Marcus’s professionalized attention (he notes ankle-gouges, belt-buckle, jaw edge). Spatial choreography is flawless: lattice → corridor → scarred door → lower passage → cistern, all tracked in continuous downward motion. The final image of copperlight on notebook charges the closure; environment literally marks the proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beat the demolition crew to the bodies—tightens once when the cracked concrete reveals access. Escalation is causal under time pressure: each removed chunk brings the town’s Monday deadline closer to exposure. The price is already paid in father’s death and Marcus’s trespass, but an on-page cost crystallizes when dust “hovered like witnesses,” making the moral invoice visible. No off-stage rescue; the notebook is wrested by his own bleeding knuckles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—“truth needs no voice, only evidence”—emerges through images (lattice fragments, suspended dust, copper-stained notebook) rather than statements. Subtext is carried in silence: the hush Marcus now inhabits is the same silence the town forced on his father. Final image reweights “cry wolf” to “let the dead speak,” a conceptual repricing that feels earned. No moralizing lines; the notebook’s plastic wrap is the only sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter: he smells “mineral stillness,” sees “crescent impressions of fingernails,” thinks in coordinates. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“He lowered his phone’s light... sat back”—mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; diction (“copperlight,” “thread the labyrinth”) belongs to a man who maps impossibilities. Register remains coastal-working-class, never drifts into lit-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors are sparse and precise: dust “hovered like witnesses” is the only figurative reach, paid off by closure. Rhythm accelerates during concrete removal—“pulled chunks away... odor rose... breath caught”—then slows into reverence. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; information density is high without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Inverts the wolf-fable into posthumous vindication; lighthouse-as-prison is fresh, yet logically arises from 19th-century offshore executions. Specificity—plastic-wrapped field notebook, ankle-height gouges—prevents generic gothic. Risk is quiet: no twist, only inherited curse fulfilled by evidence. Could survive relocation only with equal coastal-history; the father-son truth-twist is the irreplaceable engine.</comment>
