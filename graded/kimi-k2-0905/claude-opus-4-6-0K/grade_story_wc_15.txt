<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is rich—her scar-as-sentence, the needle as pen, the etched girl as mirror—yet her contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized in the moment of sewing; the final “we reached it” claims solidarity without showing the internal fracture that cost would demand. Still, her occupation, wound, and maternal theft braid motive and action tightly enough to earn the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt, iron, silk, copper) accretes until the tapestry and rising tide re-price the labyrinth from curse to cathedral. Closure is a Charged Poise—tapestry hung, water singing, girl still reaching—where the conceptual cost (future endangerment, council wrath, her own exile) is undeniable in the lullaby image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Red canyon walls that “glisten like wounds,” the crescent scar on her hip, the copper plate fitting its sandstone depression—these micro-settings constrain every move she makes; without their exact contours the map-tapestry could not be anchored above the tide. Environment literally shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—transforming condemned space into inheritance—tightens once: the first salt trickle signals that her window is closing and her tapestry must hang now or be lost. The cost is visible (cut hip, exile risk, irreversible trespass) and driven by her agency alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “broken precedents” into luminous heritage; orchid-solace beauty persists inside wound-red stone, re-weighted when the illustration plate and tapestry face the same darkness. No moral is stated—reverence is simply hung there, salt-soaked, for whoever dares follow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Maren’s poetic sensorium—needle-thread-silk metaphors braid perception and action; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature sustains rhythmic control even as tide rises, sentence length shortening like breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Syntactic variety mirrors tide pull—long tidal sentences ebb, then short stitched clauses crest. Figurative layering never muddles causality; each metaphor (wounds, lullaby, cathedral) accrues texture without loop or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; zero artifact in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sleepwalking cartography is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; dream-erosion as grammar turns a tired maze trope into geologic memoir. Risk—entering sealed ruin with only dreaming footprints as map—pays off in indelible image: copper girl and silk maze facing the same dark, water singing words finally remembered.</comment>
