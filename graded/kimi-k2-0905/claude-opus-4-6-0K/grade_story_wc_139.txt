<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clinical detachment vs. the breach Dariush forces—plays out in concrete micro-choices (photographing cartoons, pocketing letter). The final resolve to publish carries visible cost: she forfeits her lifelong armor of distance. Only the father foil is asserted, not dramatized, so the “con-artist’s child” identity stays thematic rather than pressure-forging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink pot between Dariush’s hands reweights her equation—fair trade is completion, not balance. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each artifact (passport, cartoons, ink) layers density until the stance crystallizes with felt cost. One shard transition (prep room → morning exit) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prep room’s fluorescent hum, chemical bite, and steel counter function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual precision; the ink pot’s temperature shift (warm from her palms to cold in dead hands) charges the final image. Sensory selection mirrors her narrowing perception under breach pressure. Spatial choreography remains exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her equation of fair trade—tightens when the cartoons force her to test it against a dead man’s forfeiture. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of rice-paper cartoons re-prices her prior clinical distance, foreclosing the option to remain a neutral caretaker. Cost is legible in the choice to carry the cartoons into public risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ink pot’s migration: truth as a transaction that can’t balance while the living avert their gaze. Final image—dark prep room, something “deathly alive” carried outward—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo; the mathematics metaphor stays grounded in her action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is mortuary-specific (“chemicals smell sharp and alive”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures in the breach moment, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior diction, which stays within Elara’s professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“ink dark as a bruise” recurs in closure). No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates from clinical declaratives to the final breath-length clause. One mixed metaphor—“irony coats her throat like embalming fluid”—is earned by sustained mortuary idiom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: political asylum failure rendered through post-mortem cosmetic justice. The ink pot as both satirical tool and burial offering transforms familiar refugee tragedy into intimate, occupational stakes. Risk—letting a corpse carry the argument—pays off because the living must shoulder the remainder.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Setup in first paragraph; her clinical fairness is a direct counter-reaction to father’s cons. Development: she refuses to monetize Dariush’s story yet still uses her prep-room tools to preserve it. Payoff: she trades her anonymity to publish—costly completion of the fair-trade equation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Introduced second paragraph; handled in every beat—counter placement, warmth transfer, final interment. Its brass cap conceals the cartoons that liquefy her rigid stance. Closure requires the pot between his hands; remove it and the reweighting collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Shapes stakes: denied asylum is the invisible coronary that killed Dariush, turning Elara’s abstract fairness into urgent restitution. Middle beat: cartoons satirize the regime that the system ignored. Closure links her decision to publish directly to that denied protection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Trait enacted when the cartoons dissolve her membrane of clinical distance; she photographs them despite personal risk. Cost: she forfeits the safety of detachment her father never had. Without this liquefaction the final resolve would read as arbitrary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Breach is the decisive turn: discovering cartoons inside the cap ruptures her professional firewall. Second beat: placing warm pot in corpse’s hands enacts the breach physically. Closure depends on her carrying the breach outward—no reversal possible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Method seeded in childhood “active waiting”; mechanics shown as she catalogs tells before acting. Middle: she waits with the body until the cartoons reveal themselves. Payoff: the morning exit shows waiting converted to public action—completion, not stasis.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prep room supplies tools (steel counter, chemicals) that enable her ritual precision and later the photograph. Spatial pressure—no spectators, only the dead—makes the breach intimate and irreversible. Final image requires she leave this sanctuary, carrying its charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Motivation declared early; friction dramatized when fairness collides with a system that bankrupts the honest. Micro-choice: she refuses to forge papers like her father would, accepting slower, riskier restitution. Closure pays the cost of that refusal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Tone established in first paragraph—“death carries a strange vitality”—and modulates from clinical hush to charged dawn exit. It charges the final image: darkness persists yet something “deathly alive” accompanies her. Remove the vitality motif and the ending flats.</comment>
