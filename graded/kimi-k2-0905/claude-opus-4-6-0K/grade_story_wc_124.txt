<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s aromatic caution and withheld grief are embodied in micro-choices—palming the vial, delaying the uncapping—so the final release is earned. The contradiction between mercantile detachment and visceral longing stays live in scene, not summary. Cost is felt when she recaps the vial and accepts nightly exposure: a concrete, irreversible stance. Interiority occasionally edges toward perfume-ad poeticism, trimming the last sliver to 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: uncapping the vial fuses extinct silphium with maternal lavender, creating a third scent that reweights her profession and grief. Causal chain holds—UV fluorescence triggers volatile release → scent collision → tearful recognition → decision to sleep with open vial—each step narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final line: “letting her mother’s ghost perfume the dark,” a foreclosed privacy she had guarded. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of luminous revelation mirrored in emotional exposure lands without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s ultraviolet map and crystal shadows constrain Elara’s movement and mirror her hidden vasculature of memory. The perfume vial itself functions as micro-setting: its prismatic shards repaint walls at climax, fusing external and internal light. Spatial choreography is flawless—propagation table, specimen beds, exit path all tracked. Environment directly shapes the final choice to uncap, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk olfactory collapse to feel her mother?—tightens once: the UV release forces the confrontation. Agency is deliberate uncapping under witness; no external coincidence rescues her. Cost is the irreversible mingling of extinct and maternal scent, foreclosing odorless distance. While pressure is singular rather than escalating waves, it is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chemical haunting: extinction and private loss share volatile signatures, so grief is archaeological. No character states the thesis; Fen’s limbic explanation is embedded in action. Final image of sleeping beside an open ghost-scent reweights earlier mercantile distance into surrender. Ambiguity remains—healing or slow erosion—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: “aromatically cautious,” “crystal shadows pooling.” Syntax lengthens under sentiment, then contracts at decision, mirroring breath control. No head-hop; Fen’s dialogue is externally observed. Distinctive diction—“lantern broker,” “resinous, green”—never drifts into perfume-catalog cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful: each metaphor (cathedral of grief, ghost heartbeat) accrues to the final scent-ghost. No mixed vehicles; crystal/light imagery stays coherent. One paraphrase loop—“extinct… no longer existed”—could trim 0.1. Otherwise rhythm modulates, information density stays high, and closure line is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combining bioluminescent-archival commerce with olfactory resurrection is fresh, not gimmick. Extinct silphium as perfumery Holy Grail reconfigures both botany and grief tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation over plot—but payoff justifies path. Slight deduction for familiar “uncap the keepsake” beat, redeemed by UV-scent fusion.</comment>
