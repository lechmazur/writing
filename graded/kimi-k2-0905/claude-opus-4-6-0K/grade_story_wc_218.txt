<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s quiet, methodical interiority is consistent and embodied; the diary entries act as concrete micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final acceptance is credible because every beat has shown her measuring, pruning, recording—her renunciation is simply to keep doing what she has always done, now with the cost named. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only steady resolve, so the “earned” bar is cleared but not exceeded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the oxidizing copper becoming part of the tree reconfigures the entire orchard as a shared body, cost paid in her remaining life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper wrap, diary note, and visitor arrival thickens the pattern until the final image crystallizes the stake—visibility of interdependence. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The temple orchard is not backdrop but active constraint: pillar shadows determine sapling placement, root acids sculpt ventilation shafts, copper wire must follow cambium logic. The bench, diary, and oxidizing wire function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Maren’s horticultural gaze; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—make the hidden collaboration visible—signals early and tightens with each copper wrap and visitor reaction. One meaningful deepening: the mycologist’s discovery widens the network, forcing Maren to cede control of interpretation. Cost is legible: her life hours are the finite currency being spent; the final image shows the wire permanently fused—option to undo is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of interspecies architecture emerges from concrete engineering details, not assertion. The closing image of copper merging into bark reweights every prior observation into a single resonant statement: caretaker becomes cared-for. No moralizing sentence tells us what to think; the orchard’s shared breath is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Maren’s perceptual signature—technical, patient, tactile. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly ceremonial, matching her nineteen-year ritual. No head-hopping or register drift; the one instance of “we” in the plaque text is deliberate ventriloquism for visitor clarity, not POV slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sediment into still water,” “stone trained like vine.” High information density without purple intrusion; copper gauge, lichen migration, acid sculpting all serve character goal. Closure line is clean, unadorned, letting the image carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The living-stone orchard and copper-tracing method feel freshly synthesized; neither trope is stock. The terminal-diagnosis frame is familiar, yet the response—revealing mutualism rather than chasing cure—is non-obvious and specific to this world. Risk in quiet resolution pays off: the ending’s hush is the point, not a cop-out.</comment>
