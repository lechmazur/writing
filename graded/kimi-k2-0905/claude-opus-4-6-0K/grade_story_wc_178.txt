<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Samara’s interiority is rendered with economical precision—frugality as both necessity and epistemic stance. The moment she presses her palm to the tile and whispers coordinates, her decade of threadbare patience crystallizes into an irrevocable covenant; the cost is the solitude she chooses to keep. Contradictory impulses—stoic empiricism vs. spiritual hunger—coexist inside a single beat, earning the final acceptance. No stock phrasing; every abstraction is tethered to tactile detail (reed stylus, lampblack, mended robes).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of noticing→decoding→acceptance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words via palace lineage and Samara’s knees on glazed brick. Closure is Charged Poise: the nightjar call plus star-map whisper reweights the tile from puzzle to covenant; the price is her unwitnessed solitude. Cost is legible in the final sentence—“some offers do not come twice.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The palace functions as micro-setting: dust-filled throne room, cool teal glaze under palm, overgrown terraces leaking birdcall. Environment constrains her tools—reed instead of bronze, river clay instead of parchment—and thus her epistemic method. Amber light pool and nightjar cry become the final image’s charged poise. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: seal covenant with unknown via decipherment. Escalation is accretive—each schematic sheet deepens density until the sky-map forecloses all lesser uses of the tile. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic and existential. Final cost: she surrenders the possibility of public recognition, embracing invisible devotion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from inverse relation between austerity and transcendence: the less she spends, the more she sees. Encrypted devotion is never named in abstract; it is enacted when she reads numbers as stellar positions. Final image reweights frugality from deprivation to sacred instrument. Resonance lingers as reader re-sees night sky as potential palimpsest of silent oaths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, slightly arid, matching a woman who counts stars and stitches. Syntax lengthens only during the sky-mapping beat, mirroring cerebral expansion. No dialogue; narration stays within Samara’s lexicon—no modern astronomical jargon. Perceptual signature: she notices wear-patterns in brick glaze before gods. Final whisper is rhythmic payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentence rhythm alternates between short declarative (inventory of tools) and longer accumulative clauses (star path). Density: “thread-maps of a decade’s careful poverty” performs three jobs—visual, temporal, moral. No mixed metaphors; glaze coolness reprises as sacred chill in closing beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Assyriology, number theory, and quiet mysticism feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk: turning a math puzzle into prayer without irony; the “empirically ironic” beat accomplishes the inversion. Transformative detail: covenant is not spoken but plotted across ungrouped stars. Replication test fails if you swap tile for fresco or astronomer for priest—specificity is integral.</comment>
