<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—delight in discovery while stranded—is vivid; her micro-choice to initial the chart reifies agency. The “diligently curious” trait drives every beat, yet the text skirts diagnostic speak. Cost is felt: she signs her name to a discovery her master may never see, accepting solitude as payment. Voice-specific perceptual bias (starlings as syntax) keeps her from stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: abandoned airship → starlings → phrasebook → hopscotch cipher → map → signed claim. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses rescue fantasies, choosing luminous isolation. Cost crystallizes in the final line—“as stranded as she was”—paid on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Airship’s patched silk, brass barometer, and chalk-worn deck constrain action and supply tools for decoding. Micro-setting (deck squares) literally shapes the mapping act. Sensory triage favors wind, dust, dawn light—each filtered through cartographer priorities. Environment is not backdrop; it is instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove discovery before supplies fail—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when coordinates aim her at the murmuration corridor, narrowing options to “map or vanish.” Price is tacit: she spends her last dawn watching trapped light, trading rescue time for data. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of illumination-as-isolation emerges organically from starlings chasing unusable light. Final image reweights “lux derelicta” to include the human. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. The lyrical return of “stranded” applies the concept to both light and cartographer, closing the loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature—contour lines, wind speed, graphite grids—remains cartographic. Syntax lengthens under excitement then contracts at dawn, mirroring attention. No head-hopping; vocabulary stays within Sable’s lexicon. Voice modulation under pressure is evident in the laughing timbers echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates during night-work, then slows for dawn reveal, supporting momentum. Metaphors (ink in water, breath-held light) are sparse, patterned, paid off. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“sociable isolation”) is voice-justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ornithology, obsolete cryptography, and aerial cartography feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Hopscotch-as-star-map reframes child’s game into scientific instrument, transforming trope. Conceptual risk—light as physically stranded—commits fully without gimmick. Specific detail prevents swapability; only this valley, this ship, this murmuration fit.</comment>
