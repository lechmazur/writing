<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Venn’s “steadily curious” trait is dramatized through the crib-dismantling flashback and the 11-year decoding obsession; the maternal arrow-tip choice shows embodied cost. Interiority stays specific—“laugh had tears in it” contradicts triumph with grief. The decision to dive is credibly foreshadowed; still, no live relationship crucible or status friction on scene keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: bell audibility reweights reality and Venn commits to an irreversible descent; the acid sea’s promise/ threat is the felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each mirrored rotation thickens pattern until the tonal flip becomes inevitable. Kaleidoscope-to-stylus causality is tight; no orientation debt or late rule patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Acid-sea corrosion, gear chatter, and green-sun light constrain every move; the workshop’s “burnt pennies and regret” vapor reappears in the final inhalation before launch. Arrow-tip micro-setting literalizes memory and hardness, charging the etching beat. One decimal off 9 only because spatial anchoring of island-to-sea drop momentarily thins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hear the unheard bell”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each algorithm failure until transliteration forecloses retreat. No external antagonist needed: pressure is ontological—dissolution versus endurance. Cost is visceral: mother’s relic consumed, body soon to follow. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient; a second reversal would over-crank this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “listen to what dissolves yet endures” emerges from the acid-eating world and the bell’s persistence, never author-stated. Final image reweights earlier alloys and regret into planetary invitation without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: descent may be suicide or communion; complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; diction—“manic precision,” “green sun”—betrays Venn’s techno-poetic mind. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary gear-list as bell rings, mirroring her intake of new input. No head-hop or register drift; lyrical compression is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences pull double duty—descriptive, atmospheric, causal—with almost zero scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“drunk philosopher” platform) read intentional and voice-true; no loops or synonym churn. Clause variety and paragraph cuts propel downward spiral. A single over-figurative line (“acid sea…singing through corroded metal”) barely grazes the closure beat, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cart-glider acid-sea bell-hunt feels sui generis; kaleidoscope-as-cipher repurposes toy into decoding engine without contrivance. Familiar “lost signal” trope is inverted—the world always spoke, humanity merely lacked the organ. Risk of unhearable tone is embraced, not hedged, yielding singular closure.</comment>
