<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory drives—flight from failed art and stubborn return to making—are embodied in the tremor/palette motif; her micro-choice to tint photographs with seawater and cracked pigment crystallizes values and cost. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final renunciation of pigment to the sea feels earned. Only the Stavanger curator’s wet eyes are reported, not embodied, keeping full 9+ just out of reach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dawn photos → cipher → tinted atlas tightens meaning with each layer; closure is Charged Poise—she re-opens the library to nothing/everything, foreclosing return to prior art while coastal light still owed. Cost is legible in “wells now half-empty, pigment given to the sea.” One transition (curator arrival) is clean; no orientation drift; meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Salt-warped cabin, tidal cadence, and cracked palette constrain every action; horizon line and seasonal island drift literally shape the camera’s frame. The east-window sightline is referenced in closure beat, ensuring setting charges final image. Micro-setting (palette as reliquary) functions as geography in miniature. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, salt, and faint dawn color—perfectly tuned to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost capacity to make art—tightens when photos reveal cipher; escalation is textural density, not causal reversals, but still narrows options: she can either keep pigment or give it to the sea-salt project. Curator’s arrival complicates but does not resolve; final cost is pigment forfeiture and perpetual nocturnal vigil. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “making absence luminous” emerges through sequence of tinted sunrises rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier exile: the empty library at 2 a.m. becomes a site of generative availability. No moralizing; curator’s single line is subtextual endorsement. Cipher remains mysterious, refusing tidy decode—ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s perceptual altitude: salt-sting attention, painter’s color lexicon, insomnia cadence. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for fog-thick hush, fragmentary noun phrases when shutter clicks. No head-hop; curator’s thoughts are surface-guess only. Diction stays within plausible artist’s lexicon, no register drift. Compressed lyricism is taught early and paid off in final “improbable to begin again.”</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with almost zero scaffold; only minor echo—“she began…”—repeats twice but does not stall momentum. Metaphors (islands as syllables, pigment as reliquary) stay coherent and physically grounded. No mixed vehicles or purple swell. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic click. Proofing clean.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Librarian of unborrowed books” and “cartography of luminous absence” feel fresh syntheses; dawn-island cipher repurposes landscape photography as braille of loss. Risk—slow lyrical shard with no antagonist—pays off in Charged Poise. Could edge higher if archipelago whispers had sharper acoustic specificity, but conceptually already non-generic.</comment>
