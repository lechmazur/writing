<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—needing order yet drawn to witness the nursery’s self-reordering—is vivid and embodied in tactile leaf-vein checks and night-time wire-cutting. Micro-choices (pressing leaves, unlocking vents) escalate from observation to surrender, each carrying visible cost in lost revenue and personal terror. The final renunciation feels earned because every beat has shown her incremental, reluctant relinquishment of trained control. Only minor slack: the “circuitously sincere” label is announced not dramatized, and one line edges toward self-diagnosis rather than felt paradox.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of strange leaves → untrained roses → open vents tightens until the final image reweights “tend” as witness, not design. Closure is a Charged Poise: trellis drinking rain crystallizes the new contract—attention without mastery—felt cost is the nursery’s luminous alien beauty she can no longer author. Causality never breaks; each vegetal rebellion is observed before the next, creating a rhythmic density rather than because/therefore chain. Orientation is anchored inside 20 lines; transitions (three discreet shards) are legible and serve the accruing texture.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mossy trellis, gravel path, and storm-season humidity are not backdrop but instruments: wet wood fibres catch leaves, unlocked vents let vines reroute. Micro-setting (leaf vein, dew bead) constrains Maren’s choices—she cuts wires only after tactile proof of looping veins. Sensory hierarchy is botanist-precise: venation patterns, chlorophyll glow, root-zone temperature read as diagnostic data before they become poetic. Final image—leaf resting on living moss—recharges earlier “green on green” motif with new contract, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Maren preserve authorship or surrender to witnessing?—tightens once: the night she removes every support. That single irrevocable act forecloses commercial shaping and risks business collapse, price sufficient for 800-word frame. Escalation is textural: each new vegetal anomaly adds density until the act of release becomes inevitable; no coincidence, no external rescue. Cost is visible on-page: glowing alien canopy may scare customers, yet she locks no gate, accepting unknowable commerce.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from vegetal particulars: leaf-vein circuitry reconfigures human “design” arrogance. Subtext in gesture—setting leaf on moss instead of pressing it—silently ratifies the new covenant. Final journal line risks echo yet earns its profundity because every prior image (unwinding roses, radiant linden) has embodied the insight. No moralizing, only a resonant re-pricing of what “tend” means.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s observational lattice: botanical lexicon, tactile specifics, escalating dread. Perceptual signature—light-capture efficiency, root-network architecture—reads like a scientist losing her instrument. Rhythm accelerates with polysyndeton during wire-removal spree, then exhales into rain-drinking coda. No head-hop, no filter-verb fog; compression (“She said nothing…”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence modulates from patient droplet watching to staccato destruction of supports, mirroring surrender. Information density high—single sentence can carry weather, physiology, and emotional turn (“larger, darker…glow”). Zero loops or mixed metaphors; “circuitously sincere” is the lone lexical abstraction but is immediately grounded in leaf-vein image. Opening and closing lines serve as resonant brackets without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fantastical botany feels inevitable because specifics (looping veins, efficiency glow) are extrapolated from real plant behaviour. Concept of garden-as-autopoietic partner flips “cultivation” trope without gimmick. Risk taken: quiet ending, no villain, yet stakes remain intimate—career identity erased. Final reconfiguration could not survive name-change; leaf, trellis, storm season are irreplaceable organs of this singular organism-story.</comment>
