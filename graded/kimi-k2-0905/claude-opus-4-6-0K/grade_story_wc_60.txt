<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “see everything, trust nothing” stance is dramatized in every beat—she touches residue, tests valves, refuses prayer—so the luminous skepticism is embodied, not labeled. The final moment of allowing “the luminous thing inside her chest to simply be” registers as credible renunciation because the prior causal chain (eleven days of methodical doubt) has already paid the cost. Interior contradiction is present but stays stable; no epiphany retroactively rewrites her. Just shy of 9 because the emotional price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the lid cracks, memories flood, geese resume—before/after is legible and irreversible. Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each breadcrumb intensifies pattern density until the single releasing act reweights the city’s stake. Cost is visible in the soaked boots and the neck that “ached” from staring—small but concrete. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 5 and the plaza name.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dry fountains function as both metaphor and hydraulic system; their cracked basins and mineral ghosts constrain every move Elara makes. The stained-glass box emerges as a micro-setting that literally contains the stakes. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices iridescence, smells “wet stone and regret,” ignores crowds—so detail never catalogues. One tick from 9: the Tannery District is named but not textured enough to alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each breadcrumb; options narrow from “follow or forget.” The single deepening (crack spreads) forces irreversible commitment; cost is the physical grind of chiseling and the social risk of acting alone. No coincidence resolves; the geese resume only after the box opens. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates twice, keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as civic circulation—emerges through the water system rather than exposition; no character sermonizes. The final image of “singing through the night” reweights the earlier silence without moralizing. Subtext in the defiant hush (“she did not pray”) quietly pits individual agency against collective amnesia. Complexity is honored: citizens weep “without knowing why, then knew exactly why, then wept harder”—a layered, honest reaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual signature—mathematical, skeptical, sidereal. Syntax lengthens under pressure (“she could spend a few more hours prying at corroded valves”) to mimic sidereal patience; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience (“Time had snagged on something”) but is immediately re-grounded in her sensation of silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphoric vehicles stay consistent (emotional cholesterol, calendar pinned open). No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences slow to match “sidereal patience,” then snap to “Light erupted.” A single mixed metaphor (“time had snagged” vs. “emotional cholesterol”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen geese as civic pause, memories as mineral clots—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh at first encounter. The fountains-as-memory-pipes concept commits fully; no late rule changes bail out the plot. Specificity (“someone’s mother singing off-key”) prevents abstraction from sliding into allegory. Risk in the sidereal patience frame pays off by making the climax a single precise mechanical act rather than a magical gesture.</comment>
