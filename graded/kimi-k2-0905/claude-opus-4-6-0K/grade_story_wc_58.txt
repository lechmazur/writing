<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and particular, but the only micro-choice on stage—kneeling to pull one thread—does not generate immediate consequence or trade-off. The self-obituary is a meta-performance rather than an embodied decision that alters present options; presence is declared, not dramatized under pressure. Cost is asserted (“she wanted to”) rather than paid on the page, so the renunciation feels intellectual, not lived. Still, the voice’s perceptual signature keeps Maren distinct and avoids label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes a new stance—staying—whose cost is the forfeiture of every horizon she once chased. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of leave-taking images tightens into one still moment, reweighting the stake. However, the story exceeds 800 words (~870), breaching the hard scope ceiling; this is a technical disqualification for “immediate publishability” in this market, so the score is capped below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Garden, thread, and autumn light are filtered through a traveler’s gaze that notices decay and texture; every detail is POV-colored, never tourist-catalog. The indigo thread functions as micro-setting, recharging the final image when it is pressed between pages—an object that constrains the choice to stop writing and start inhabiting. Spatial choreography is clean; the terrace descent, cracked flagstones, and skeletal maples stay trackable. Weather and foliage subtly guide the emotional temperature without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep moving vs. stay—is signaled early and tightens once: she writes herself into the one place she cannot leave. Under Accumulative lens, the density of departure images peaks, then breaks against the final stillness; the price is the loss of her identity as perpetual traveler, felt in the last line. No reversal or antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and coherent. The cost is legible but abstract—opportunity loss rather than a concrete forfeiture on stage—keeping it just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accrual of absences: movement as both self-protection and slow self-erasure. The final image reframes prior material without moralizing—staying becomes the dangerous, honest act. Subtext lives in gesture (thread wound around finger) and silence (no ship horns). Ambiguity is purposeful: the reader must decide whether this stillness is healing or another aestheticized performance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Maren’s perceptual filter; syntax elongates and softens under melancholy, then shortens into the final declarative stay. Diction—“latticed shadows shifted like breath”—is lyrical yet precise, never purple. No dialogue, so voice carries all distinction; it succeeds. Patterned elision (“explained absences”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with emotional arc: long associative sentences in reflection, then crisp final assertions. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, each image extending the garden/departure motif; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold detected—“she wrote… she wrote… she wrote…”—but it mimics the act of composition, so reads intentional. No loops, no register drift, no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—“obituaries for the living”—is fresh and immediately pays conceptual dividends. Autumn garden as liminal space is familiar, but the thread-from-paradise-carpet reweights it: decay literally holds a fragment of imagined permanence. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation instead of plot, but coherence holds. Could only be this character in this setting; template swap would collapse the resonance.</comment>
