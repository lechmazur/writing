<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and particular—her belief in analog memories is embodied through tactile scarf-handling and the “low collective hum” she needs. One micro-choice—pressing the scarf into the hyperbolic model—drives the turn, and the felt cost is the spatial vertigo that follows. The “sanely eccentric” label is shown, not told, by her off-grid shift and poetic call-number notes. No interior contradiction is staged in-scene, so the 9-band just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the library aisles now “contain more room than physics allows,” reconfiguring Maren’s world with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each sensory layer (cinnamon ridge, garden-soil streak) accretes until the geometry literally bends. Orientation is anchored by word 82 (“third basement level…hour that did not exist”), beating the 120-word safe-zone. No causal break; the geometry rule is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The horn-torus shelving and fluorescent half-light are filtered through Maren’s perceptual quirks, not delivered as tour-guide notes. The scarf-as-micro-setting constrains the decisive action—only its specific stains provide the coordinate anchors the model needs. Spatial choreography is clean: cart, table, lamps, aisles track without drift. Hyperbolic library could feel gimmicky, but detail density keeps it lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—is signaled early and deepened when geometry offers literal entry. Pressure tightens once: placing the scarf into the model irreversibly widens the aisles, foreclosing Euclidean safety. Cost is conceptual but legible on the page. No second reversal or tangible loss limits entry into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the conflation of memory topology and narrative space; no character sermonizes. Final image of breathing stories just past parallel lines reweights earlier scarf stains without moralizing. Subtext in patrons’ “witnessed silence” hints at shared ontological risk. Theme stays complex: possibility expands, but so does unmoored solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, distance held steady. Syntax flexes with pressure—“the scarf grew warm. Not hot, not burning...”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; perceptual signature (cinnamon as architecture) is unique and consistent. Lyric compression is taught in sentence one and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence lengths mimic breathing acceleration; no looped stems or synonym churn detected. Mixed metaphors are avoided—hyperbolic geometry stays mathematically coherent. High information density: one sentence can deliver setting, backstory, and emotional tilt. Minor elevation in diction (“architectural ridge”) is justified by Maren’s reflective precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hyperbolic math with library mysticism feels fresh and inevitable; no direct genre antecedent. Scarf-as-coordinate-device repurposes a sentimental object into ontological tool without contrivance. Concept commits fully—no safety retreat to “it might have been a dream.” Slight risk in abstract stakes still sharpens rather than blurs focus.</comment>
