<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s promise-bound solitude and terrain-reader intuition are vivid; the interior contradiction between clinging to the past and refusing to re-enter it crystallizes in the final touch of stone. The embodied cost—seven years calcified into a single breath of peace—lands cleanly. Minor slack: “empirically intuitive” flirts with label-speak, though context redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a sharp Charged Poise: transparent stone, withheld step, palm pressed, whispered line—cost is the door left open and the life not taken. Causal chain holds across all beats; the ant trail as catalyst is seeded early and paid off. No orientation debt; lens (Situational → Accumulative) is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Valley limestone, rising creek, fungal cathedral, and brass socket are tactile, selective, and directly shape the final approach and interface. The blooming cavern constrains the choice—step through or retreat—so environment charges the closure image. One hairline slip: “sweet, impossibly fragrant” edges toward thesaurus, but beats are short enough to survive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—promise vs. second chance—tightens once when the archway clarifies the cost of return. Escalation is situational pressure: rising water, narrowing fissure, luminous bloom; agency is the refusal itself, felt price the door left glowing behind her. No reversal, but one meaningful stance crystallization suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrent maps-as-lives and the refusal to redraw hers; final image of palm on transparent stone reweights all prior cartography as lived terrain, not escapable diagram. No moral spoken; ambiguity lingers in the glowing door left open. Resonance is understated yet undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a consistent, map-seller’s perceptual signature—terrain logic, antique textures, mineral scents. Syntax breathes with scene tempo: longer climbs, clipped crawl. No dialogue, so voice purity remains. One lyrical lapse—“blooming around her” repeated within three lines—knocks off the 9-band edge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, high-density; most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Minor scaffold: “she realized” filter and “impossibly fragrant” elevation slightly dilute immediacy in a peak beat. No loops or mixed metaphors touch closure; rhythm modulates credibly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “portal to alternate life” trope is transformed through cartographic expertise, ant trail ingress, and brass matrix typography—details particular to Elara’s lived trade. The refusal ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Slight risk in lyric bloom pays off without gimmick.</comment>
