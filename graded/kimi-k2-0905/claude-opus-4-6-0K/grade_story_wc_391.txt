<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—cartographic precision vs. moral revulsion—is dramatized in concrete beats: the theodolite sighting that once guided conquest now measures moonlight to erase empire. Her embodied impatience (shaking hands, sleepless pacing) is shown, not labeled, and the final renunciation—crossing the viaduct with counterfeit maps—carries undeniable cost: she can never go home. The only slip is a near-label “rage she could barely contain,” instantly redeemed by the physical act of breathing cold air until the feeling passes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lake’s frozen reflection pressed under glass reweights every prior map as a quiet weapon. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases until the state change from liquid to ice becomes the metaphor for imperial blindness—and the cost is legible in the final image: she walks toward the empire carrying its undoing, exile assured. Causality is pristine: each altered coordinate is a because/therefore response to the memory of villagers fleeing her poles. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Basalt columns interfere with compasses, a concrete constraint that makes the sanctuary invisible to the Bureau and enables the entire plot; the frozen lake’s mirror surface returns as the closure image, re-configuring earlier moon tracks into a secret under glass. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Maren notices magnetic hums, frost polygons, theodolite clicks—not tourist vistas. Only micro-slip: “organ built for a god” leans ornamental, but it is brief and early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate territory by sabotaging imperial maps—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she begins nightly lunar sightings. The meaningful deepening occurs at the lake’s freeze: ice becomes the permanent medium that will carry her falsified atlas back to the empire, narrowing her options to exile or betrayal. Cost is visible—she packs and walks away forever—but the external consequence (empire’s confusion) remains off-stage, slightly softening the final punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: maps as quiet colonial violence transformed into quiet decolonial sabotage. The final image of ice “changed state” re-prices every prior survey as a slow insurgency. Subtext operates in gesture—theodolite turned from conquest to concealment—and in the paradox that accuracy now serves erasure. No thematic echo phrases; the lake’s reflection is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyric compression taught early (“geometry that always preceded soldiers”) and paid off in the final “season, inevitable and quiet.” Syntax mirrors Maren’s trained precision—measured cadences, cartographic diction—yet fractures into moral revulsion without register drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct: she notices angles, magnetic hums, moon arcs. Filter verbs are minimal and justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; long sentence builds pressure, short fragment releases (“She breathed the cold air until the feeling passed”). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs—advance plot, deepen atmosphere, reveal interiority. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartographer who weaponizes inaccuracy—is non-obvious and rigorously pursued: every altered coordinate is dramatized. Risk-taking lies in choosing slowness as insurgent tactic; the ice-state metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; lunar navigation as decolonial tech is fresh. Specific detail—“hexagonal basalt columns,” “residual moisture conducting faint hums”—creates freshness without ornament.</comment>
