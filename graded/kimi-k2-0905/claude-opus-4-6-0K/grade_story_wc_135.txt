<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maret’s archivist-obsession is concrete: she fingers the valve, opens exile notebooks, begins cataloguing. The exile years are summarized, not dramatized, so the “hollow” cost is asserted, not felt; still, her return resolve is embodied in the first motions of work. Osen functions as welcome-mat; no status tension or mutual pressure is staged, so the relationship crucible bullet is moot. Interior contradiction is present but thin: exile pain is named, not enacted; the final “blank page” stance is earned by long habit, not by an on-page renunciation that costs her anything visible now.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: exile → return → valve discovery → restart of archive. Closure is Charged Poise: “We start with what’s missing” crystallizes options and stakes; the cost is the mildewed ruin she must now shoulder. One causal gap: the council rescinds off-page, but the inciting arrival is immediate and the final commitment is on-page. Orientation is clean by word 60; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the closing beat.</comment>

<comment>Salt-stung harbor, tide-marked walls, and the valve’s green patina are filtered through Maret’s professional eye and constrain her next act—cataloguing. Weather is causal: rain stops to give the “blank page” light that frames the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: ferry → quay → archive door → table. No world inconsistency; proper-noun load is light and reused. The setting does not yet force a tactical trade-off, so the 9-band gate is barely missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes: rescue the archive / reassemble meaning. Pressure tightens once: the valve proves the lost convoy returned, so the missing crates now matter more. Escalation is knowledge-based, not adversarial; still, under causal lens the new datum narrows her path to “start with absence.” Cost is implicit—years of ruin to sift—but not yet viscerally paid on the page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-shape emerges through valve→gap→catalogue motion; no explicit thesis. Subtext in Osen’s silent door-hold and the unspoken fear that “it was not enough” carries more weight than dialogue. Final blank-page image reweights earlier salt-corrosion motif: ruin is now raw material. Ambiguity survives—will the gaps consume her?—but the piece flirts with sentimental “restorer as hero” glow, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to Maret’s cataloguer perception: “salt corroded paper… whispered rust” is professional synesthesia. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action; no head-hop. Diction stays within archivist lexicon except possibly “bruised sky,” which is brief and atmospheric. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; final sentence lands with cadential punch. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice is coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “bleached stone… grooves worn by centuries” grounds place and metaphor in one sweep. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs appear but coincide with reflective beats, not action. One minor scaffold: “She had learned… she had written… she had built” triplet could lose middle clause without loss. No artifact appears in final third; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Archivist of oceanic absences” is fresh; the vanished Governor’s convoy reframes standard maritime mystery through cataloguing logic. Exile-then-return is familiar, but the reactive-visionary trait and the inversion of salt as preservative give new inflection. Risk is moderate—quiet restoration story, not twist-driven—but specificity of maker’s-mark valve and mildewed tide-marks transforms template. Could swap city name and still function, so not fully singular, yet harbor-archive nexus feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
