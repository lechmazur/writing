<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s obliging nature is shown through her quiet, patient modifications—each favor a micro-choice that gains access to the nexus—so her climactic pull of the lever feels earned. The interior contradiction between her public “yes” and private obsession is kept alive in scene, not summary. No other characters press her, so relationship crucible is absent, yet her solitude sharpens the cost: she proves the theory alone, with no witness but sleeping giants. The final hand on the warm hull is a credible, scaled renunciation of acclaim—an earned stasis that fits the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the hologram folds away, leaving Maren in a before/after where sideways time is no longer hypothesis but lived knowledge, paid for by irreversible solitude. Causal linkage holds—each rewired coil is traceable to prior obliging favors—so the lens stays causal-accumulative without late ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (copper lantern station, frost, twilight). No teleporting props; the nexus is introduced early and its 11-minute window tightens the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station’s mechanically warm hull is returned to at opening, midpoint, and closure, acting as both environment and tactile object that charges the final image. Cloud-sea twilight and magnetic polarity shift are not postcard backdrops—they gate the nexus activation, so setting constrains the decisive action. Spatial choreography is clean: climb to upper platform, roosting wings below, hand on railing tracks throughout. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Maren’s tech-mechanic gaze: she notices generator hum, frost crystallization, conduit flicker—details that double as emotional register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove lateral time—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tested in a single tightening beat: the 11-minute polarity window. The hologram success forecloses the option of public validation tonight; cost is the immediate choice to keep the discovery secret, paid in the image of her hand on the hull amid sleeping wings. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Could edge higher if an external obstacle (equipment glitch, approaching storm) had threatened the window, but the internal stakes still land with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of scientific triumph: knowledge arrives as a whisper, not applause. The sideways-time concept reweights the motif of “quiet arrivals” first attached to awakenings, so the ending reconfigures earlier material without moralizing. Subtext resides in the wings’ low murmur—creatures that embody the theory yet remain indifferent to human clocks. Final image of light arriving “from the side” gives a non-literal answer to the thematic question; no character utters a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Maren’s perceptual signature: mechanical warmth, conduit hum, frost patterns—details a sky mechanic would notice. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses at the lever pull (“She pulled.”) to mimic heartbeat deceleration/acceleration. No head-hopping; the xenobiologists remain off-stage silhouettes. Free-indirect shade (“time moves sideways”) blends seamlessly with narrative report, maintaining modest psychic distance.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or world rule. Metaphors are spare and coherent—copper lantern, spine of an open book—never stacked to opacity. Strong verbs (“hung,” “crystallized,” “bloomed,” “folded”) carry weight, minimizing adjectives. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid twilight description to staccato lever beat, then subsides with the hologram dimming—line-level craft mirrors emotional arc without drawing attention to itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lateral-time premise is fresh, but the real ingenuity is staging personal discovery as anti-spectacle: proof happens off-stage from the scientific community, in the hush of alien wings. Mechanic-as-theorist reverses the usual scientist-prodigy trope; her tool-access ingenuity feels specific to trade. Holographic biology mapping is a novel method, not mere hand-wavium. Final image reframes prior “awakening” language so the twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
