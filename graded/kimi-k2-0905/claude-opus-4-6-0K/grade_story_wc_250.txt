<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Guardian’s muteness and nightly ritual are vivid, but her interior contradiction is only implied; the girl remains a receptive silhouette rather than a second crucible. The earned stasis lands—she keeps her silence—yet the cost is soft because no prior beat shows her tempted to speak. Micro-choices (mirror angle, shutter tug) are present and specific, satisfying the 9+ test, but the absence of a visible internal fracture caps excellence.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens is declared early and held: each shutter-mirror placement thickens the light-pattern until the canal itself “breathes.” Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Closure is a Charged Poise—star set between them, secrecy endured—cost felt in the girl’s slower breath and the canal’s deepening dark. A hairline slip: the warehouse-rig timing is summarized rather than shown once, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt dock, warped planks, beaded rain, and dental mirror as micro-setting all constrain the Guardian’s reach and charge the final image. Every sensory pick is filtered through her habitual gaze; no tourist catalog. The mirror’s star-thread and the breathing shutter-grid evolve causally with each tug of line. Environment literally guides the only actions possible—meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep the girl inside the edge of the secret without words. Pressure escalates by accretion—each new rectangle of gold steps closer to her feet, tightening the silent offer. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the girl’s breathing shifts from clenched to survive-able. Cost is legible (Guardian spends the night’s ritual energy, girl risks staying), though not persistent beyond the image.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as active care, darkness taught to hold its own light. Subtext lives in shutter angles and star-placement; no one moralizes. Final image reweights the premise—darkness deepens to receive more light—achieving Conceptual Repricing without exposition. Almost no platitude residue; one abstract clause “teach darkness the value of stars” is the single near-slip.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays welded to the Guardian’s perceptual bias—star-beam angles, wet-plank sounds, fishing-line tension. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during mirror tilt; no drumbeat. No dialogue, so voice purity holds. The girl’s interior is ethically ventriloquized only through mirror reflection and breath shift—keeps distance clean.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the shutter spirals; sentence variety is purposeful. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“threading starlight into the canal’s dark surface” does three jobs in nine words. One minor scaffold: “the patterns changed each night” is tell-ish, but it compresses safely and never touches closure.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Silent lighthouse-less guardian using a dental mirror to plant stars in canal darkness is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Shutter-loom light-spiral feels fresh, not gimmick, because mechanics are shown early and limit every later move. Risk—no spoken words—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Could push higher if the girl carried an equally specific counter-gesture.</comment>
