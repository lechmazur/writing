<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied: she rises before dawn, handles each postcard like evidence, and her final soft-spoken insight feels earned by years of solitary looking. The internal contradiction—wanting to “feel toward” the question yet guarding her ritual from onlookers—stays alive in scene. Micro-choices (setting the brush down, taking the card gently) reveal values hierarchy without declaration. Cost is visible when she admits the flower needs “the hush,” implicitly surrendering any claim to own or display its beauty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Pavilion’s painted petals “close” in satisfied rest, re-weighting decades of inquiry into acceptance. Causal chain holds—each dawn projection deepens the mural which in turn deepens Lena’s stance—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) remains coherent. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 words; no spatial or temporal drift. Cost is legible in the final image: understanding equals relinquishing the need to expose the bloom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber panels, cathedral glass, and postcard emulsions are filtered through Lena’s painter-eye, guiding color choices and constraining when she can work. Translucent surfaces function as micro-setting: their optical limits dictate the sole productive hour and shape her layered technique. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, brush, satchel, projected ghosts track without drift. Weather (snowmelt) evolves causally with narrative weeks, grounding passage of time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the artist apprehend why darkness invites bloom—tightens when the missing 1938 postcard appears, personifying the answer she seeks. One meaningful deepening occurs: the granddaughter’s shy-bloom interpretation reframes Lena’s entire mural from pursuit to surrender. No reversal is needed; the pressure shifts from acquisition to acceptance, foreclosing further search. Cost is felt: she stops painting and watches the walls “close,” relinquishing public display of insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not lecture: darkness as invitation rather than privation accumulates across glass projections, moth mention, and final quiet bloom. Subtext in the granddaughter’s “shy” remark reframes the whole mural without overt statement. No moral is declared; resonance rests in the painted petals closing in amber twilight. Particulars—ink-blue skies, flash photo, Guatemalan greenhouse—root universality in irreplaceable detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature is painterly—light “pours,” petals “press outward against their own architecture.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation then compresses in the final hush, mirroring slowed time. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to Lena. Dialogue fragment carries subtext and generational echo, cleanly distinct from narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—honey-colored light, slow mechanical labor of petals—each image advances atmosphere or theme without clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. Copy is clean, tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Core premise (night-bloom as metaphor for hidden beauty) is familiar, but synthesis via cathedral glass, forgotten postcard archive, and amber pavilion feels specific and non-obvious. Risk resides in quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic reversal; payoff justifies the gamble. Details resist swap test—acid-etched secret botany, 1938 Guatemalan greenhouse—rooting novelty in verifiable minutiae. Fresh inflection: understanding equals withdrawal from display, reversing usual artist-as-exhibitor arc.</comment>
