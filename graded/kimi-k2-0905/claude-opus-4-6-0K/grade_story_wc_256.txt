<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to preservationist habit while suspecting it is taxidermy—drives every descent; her micro-choice to strike the bell through the lens in Vault 19 physically enacts the renunciation of archival safety for living resonance, paying the cost of professional identity. The grandfather’s lens anchors generational memory yet is handled with tactile reverence that reveals her need for tactile lineage. No second character appears, so relationship/status tests are waived; the crucible is self-versus-collection. The final endurance—“I am here, and I am listening”—earns stasis by foreclosing digital rescue forever, cost scaled to the story’s length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each descent adds density of lost timbres until the pattern break in Vault 19 reweights the stake from salvage to co-resonance. Orientation secured by word 87 (“Laboratory of Lost Sounds”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the golden-shadow wave crystallizes options—no sound will ever be “saved” again, only held in mutual listening—cost is the irreversible abandonment of archival certitude, visible in the lens held steady as conduit, not relic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vaulted ceiling, amber geometry, and refrigerated vaults are filtered through Maren’s声学-trained ear-eye; carbide flame and wax cylinders texture both atmosphere and tactical access. The lens itself becomes micro-setting that alters sound propagation and thus choice. Golden shadows charge the final image by making resonance visible, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across single-POV descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can lost sounds live outside machines?—signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens when the grid’s return reopens “safety” yet she keeps descending; Vault 19’s sympathetic resonance forces the final stance crystallization. Cost: abandonment of institutional preservation method, felt as the lens transmits rather than protects. No coincidence; escalation is density-driven under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation into pilgrimage: connection as woven texture rather than linear rescue. The lens’s shift from heirloom to acoustic conduit reprises the motif without sermon. Final image reweights “lost” to “shared,” offering no moral, only charged poise. Avoids thematic echo—no character states the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature—sound-as-color, flame-as-geometry. Syntax lengthens during listening beats, contracts during strikes, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so naturalism test waived. Diction stays within acoustician lexicon without jargon dump; carbide, overtone, foil read as lived tools.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances density or resonance. Mixed metaphors avoided—“amber geometry” is singular, sustained. High information density: “ heat-scarred glass” carries both history and function. Rhythm modulates from long cadence of descent to staccato bell strikes, climaxing in the resonant wave without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—last acoustic archivist abandons archive for co-resonance—is fresh inversion of post-apocalyptic salvage tales. Lens-as-prism for lost sound is specific synthesis of grandfather relic and lab tool, irreplaceable. Golden shadows visualizes sound memory without borrowing famous images. Risky accumulative structure pays off in felt reconfiguration.</comment>
