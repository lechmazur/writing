<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her life-long trade of “making the dead beautiful” powers every micro-choice. The decision to save the aurora itself crystallizes her hierarchy of values: beauty at the edge of ending. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. reverence, duty vs. futility—simmer under stillness, embodied in breath-level attention. Cost is visible: the dimming sky answers her theft with a paler light, and she pockets the chip knowing it may never be found.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of beauty-work → cosmic beauty-work. Orientation locked by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure is a Charged Poise—emerald now holds the planet’s last song, aurora visibly weaker, Lira’s vigil becomes Earth’s final cosmetic act. Cost is legible in the exhausted light and her solitude; no reversals needed under this lens.</comment>

<comment>Skyborne ice-grotto is tactile: translucent walls sing, stone ledge cools palms, case snaps open with metallic echo. Aurora filters choices—green heartbeat dictates recording rhythm, violet spiral shapes data geometry. Micro-setting (emerald chip) becomes final coffin, charging the image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors a mortician’s clinical eye; no static tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens once: random ribbons prove recordable, so she acts. No antagonist; pressure is entropic unwind. Single deepening (pattern discerned → infusion) forecloses option to wait; cost is immediate aurora dimming. Escalation strictly Accumulative: density of meaning, not causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: beauty as resistance to erasure. No thesis statements; final image of fading sky and glowing chip reweights premise without moral. Particulars—phosphorescent cheeks, magnetic heartbeat—accumulate into cosmic analogue. Ambiguity survives: maybe no one will find the chip, maybe beauty is still futile, maybe not.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds interior distance; perceptual signature is mortician-clinical (“pigments mixed from minerals and light-reactive compounds”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for aurora reverie, clipped fragments when chip activates. No dialogue; voice sustains lyric cohesion. No filter-verb stacks; prose breathes with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language disciplined—vehicles stay physical (aurora as heartbeat, chip as coffin). Information density high: each line adds light physics, emotional weight, or tool detail. Zero paraphrase loops; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cosmic mortician saving the aurora—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (end-of-world, data crystal) transformed through embalmer’s gaze. Risky lyric stillness paid off in Charged Poise. Specificity of mortician craft prevents generic “save the world” arc; emotional truth anchors spectacle.</comment>
