<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise—her mathematician’s skepticism and her need to “sculpt space for reflection” anchor every micro-choice. The moment she kneels and presses the tile, the remembered/engineered double memory is embodied, not declared. Her final weeping is credible accumulation, not epiphany; the cost is the acknowledgment that her grandmother’s empathy-archive will now cost Maren her own time and belief. The only friction is that Solveig’s younger self is ventriloquized without voiced resistance, slightly softening the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren’s palm on the tile becomes the concrete image where meaning is repriced—she does not believe in magic, yet she now stewards it. Causal chain holds: tile → cipher → archive → altered vocation, each step legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final sentence “Maren listened” crystallizes options and cost without exposition. Persistent constraint is established: she will spend her life maintaining an invisible symphony. No orientation or lens ambiguity debts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower is not backdrop but instrument: wind, salt, whale breath, and ceramic cool filter every beat through Maren’s sensory bias. The heart-tile functions as micro-setting that literally constrains her final choice—she must decide to step onto it again. Spatial choreography is immaculate; whales migrate south as the internal migration northward into memory happens. Only the southern horizon line drifts slightly generic, preventing the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will accept custodianship of an invisible archive—tightens once when the cipher reveals the archive’s tenderness, not superstition. Escalation is textural: density of decoded kindness accumulates until refusal becomes emotionally impossible; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits her lifelong skepticism as an identity. The whale migration supplies living urgency but does not directly narrow options, keeping the score just below the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “attention is the only afterlife”: encoded tenderness outlives forgetting. No character ever labels the theme; it accrues through tile, cipher, whales, and final listening. The symphony metaphor is repriced—initially “unheard,” finally “every silence deliberate,” giving the reader a non-literal answer. Complexity is honored: Maren’s skepticism is not defeated but repurposed, allowing plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains mathematically tinged perceptual signature—“combinatorial curiosities,” “neurological, not supernatural.” Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences breathe during transcription, then compress into crystalline final clause. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The single POV remains modest; no knowledge is withheld or over-claimed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the dark shapes breaching far out, their exhalations catching light like brief, silent bells” renders whales, sound-as-image, and cosmic punctuation. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; each verb is strong, each noun specific. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges symphony motif. High information density yet effortless oral cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—magic square as empathy cipher archived during whale migration—feels inevitable yet fresh. Familiar tropes (skeptic vs. magic, inherited vocation) are rotated 90° through combinatorial mathematics and tenderness-as-data. Risk of quiet ending is embraced; payoff is the unheard symphony becoming accountable. Only the grandmother’s youth-tile memory edges close to stock ancestral haunt, preventing 9.5.</comment>
