<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s shift from “protect old things” to “rebuild new ones” is embodied in her nightly micro-choices (re-shelving by wound, wheat-pasting poems). Caul’s monthly molting stays off-stage; the one visible persona swap (loud strategist) is reported, not dramatized, so interior contradiction is shown only in Maren. The coffee-tin hand-off carries palpable cost—she must decide to spread, not preserve, the fragile pages—so the final endurance reads earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly library labor layers pattern until the final image of poems on concrete reweights the stake from “save books” to “seed beauty.” Orientation is immediate; the moon timeline tightens each shard. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the parking-garage pillars—emblems of gray inevitability—are repurposed into a constellation of paper, proving the premise that fracture can be forged into light. Cost is visible: the poems are exposed to weather, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The roofless library’s rusted lattice and star-sieve sky constrain every action—books mildew, inmates shiver, poems must be moved or lost. Maren’s body under Orion, the coffee tin’s dented geography, and the moon’s slow arc are used as tactile instruments of choice, not backdrop. The final image of readers tilting heads “as if searching for stars through a missing roof” recharges the opening ceiling metaphor, turning setting into closure engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to resist cultural erasure—tightens when the warden threatens shutdown; Caul’s charm (off-stage) keeps the space but the real narrowing is Maren’s: keep pages safe or release them to vandalism/weather. The photocopy-and-paste decision forecloses preservation, accepting loss as the price of circulation. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; cost is the physical destruction of the onionskin originals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete refrains: “forge beauty from anarchy,” “resistance that blooms,” and the final “luminous fracture.” No character moralizes; the parking-garage poems silently reprice urban decay into readerly wonder. The ambiguity—will the pages survive winter?—invites reflection without forced equivalence. Subtext lives in gesture: the guard who “turned away to give him the galaxy’s worth of privacy” enacts the theme more powerfully than exposition could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: rust “oxidized into lace,” poems “written across every personality.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat; rhythm mirrors star-drifts and quick finger-sorting. No head-hopping; Caul’s interior accessed only via observable act or reported speech. Voice modulation earns the finale’s hush without slipping into poetic purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty: “Stars poured through the absent rafters like light through a sieve” sets scene, stakes, and metaphor in twelve words. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“Conceptual Repricing”-level abstractions) is earned by accumulated texture rather than scaffold. Closing line “It held what it could” lands with monosyllabic breath after lush prior cadence, showing purposeful rhythm control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Roofless prison-library-as-observatory, personality-molting poet, Dewey-defying “shelve by wound” system—syntheses feel inevitable, not gimmicky. The onionskin scroll passed from tin to city walls transforms familiar “zines on concrete” trope into luminous fracture. Risk of sentimentality averted by exposing the poems to weather; beauty is forged, not rescued. Specificity (Colombian label faded to illegibility) anchors universals in tactile detail.</comment>
