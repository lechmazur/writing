<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—career security vs. moral reckoning—are dramatized in the glove-on/glove-off micro-choice and the pen-stroke that forfeits her fee. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in sensory cold and fern-whispers; no diagnostic self-labeling. The final renunciation is earned because the text has shown her prior reliance on coffee-stain augury and plant-telepathy to gauge risk. Cost is visible: she signs away three years of solvency in one ink line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: “DISPUTED” on the form re-weights every prior beat and carries undeniable financial cost. Causal lens holds: fungicide telepathy → fern warning → coffee fork → bare-hand burn → signed refusal. No teleporting props; violin, documents, and pen track cleanly. Orientation anchored by word 80; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet observatory, midsummer light lag, and crystal violin are not postcard backdrop: the violin’s cold burn literally forces the glove removal that triggers the final choice. Micro-setting—coffee stain on saucer—functions as prophetic tool and reappears in the fork-image that times her decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate: pedestal, saucer, pen, ferns stay in consistent relation. Environment constrains the act, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs. paycheck—tightens when bare palm meets ice violin and the fern-memory names Marija; option space collapses to sign or authenticate. One meaningful escalation suffices; no external reversals needed. Cost is legible: the signed word “DISPUTED” forfeits the imperial fee and invites legal limbo. Agency drives the turn; coincidence merely informs, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—objects carry unpaid debts—emerges from the violin’s cold song and the ferns’ trans-generational memory, never sermonized. Final image of a “garden waiting to remember” re-prices the empire’s prestige as hollow. Ambiguity lingers: we don’t know if Marija’s heirs will win, only that silence is broken. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is imagistic, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: starlight “scattered… in pale constellations” reads as her professional awe, not authorial tour. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at the burn—“she gasped”—mirroring pulse. No head-hop; fern-telepathy is rendered as external sensation, not omniscient exposition. Distinctive diction: “provenance,” “spore memory,” “mulberry ache” all within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build awe, then single stressed verbs (“She signed”) land the turn. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“starlight… scattered… constellations”—so it reads as taught texture, not purple overload. Zero filter-verb clusters in peak beat; cold burn is delivered direct.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fungicide-induced botanical telepathy as moral compass feels fresh yet internally coherent. Ice-crystal violin carrying ancestral grief synthesizes antique-instrument trope with speculative materiality. The coffee-stain augury and fern-memory network interlock to create a non-obvious investigative toolkit. Risk-taking (talking plants, frozen violin) never retreats into metaphor; physical consequences stay literal.</comment>
