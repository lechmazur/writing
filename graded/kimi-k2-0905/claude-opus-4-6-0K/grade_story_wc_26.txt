<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s “softly deliberate tenderness” and choice to splice shadows are concrete and embodied; the interior contradiction between scholarly purity and necessary impurity is dramatized in the final splice. The river-stone micro-choice anchors her motivation without tidy epiphany. No secondary characters press her, so status dynamics are N/A; the solitary arc is credible and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s splice reweights the archive’s purity rule with the visible cost of “impurity,” crystallized in the violet flush of Oren’s page. Causal chain holds—footage comparison → pattern loss → decision → splice → bud—without cheats. Orientation lands by 80 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to final image. Cost is legible in the branch’s single bud and her held breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The petal-page, river stone, and misted shelves act as micro-setting that constrains her splice method; every tool is tactile. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Maren’s archivist-gardener bias—pollen, paper, violet flush—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean from desk to branch. The final apricot dusk recharges the “threshold” motif, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the archive’s dying hope—is signaled early and tightens through the shadow-loss pattern break. One meaningful deepening: the early vs. recent footage comparison forces the splice trade-off. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves. The visible price is the archive’s purity and her own scholarly grief, felt in the “bright pang.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shadow as architecture of hope; no character moralizes. The final image of the single bud reweights the entire premise without stating a thesis. Ambiguity lingers: hope reborn, but at cost of truth. Resonance is particular to petal-pages, not generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s archivist perceptions; diction (“cataloging footage,” “geometry of his body”) is consistently hers. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences calm, then shorten at the splice. No dialogue, so voice remains pure narrative with distinct perceptual signature. Patterned elision (no quotes, no tags) is taught early and pays off in the silent dream-footage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no loops or paraphrase. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no stacking. Information density high: “shadow unbound” compresses concept and stakes. Opening and final lines bracket with stone and dusk, creating propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The dream-library of pressed petals is fresh; the “shadow as hope’s architecture” angle reweights familiar tropes. Risk-taking in reversing the archive’s purity rule feels inevitable, not gimmicked. Specificity of foxglove, larkspur, evening primrose prevents generic fantasy. Transformation test fails if names change—petal-pages are irreplaceable.</comment>
