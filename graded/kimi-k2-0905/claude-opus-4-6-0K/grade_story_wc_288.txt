<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clutching vanishing memories while re-engineering her exile into sovereignty—are dramatized through concrete micro-choices (mapping tides, building bridges, calibrating the sundial). The final renunciation of loneliness is earned by the causal chain of those choices, and the cost is felt in the daily erosion of the memories she archives. Interiority stays specific and embodied; no diagnostic self-labeling intrudes. The eleven-year solitude is asserted rather than shown, a minor compression slip that keeps this just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the closing sentence crystallizes a new conceptual divide—“alone” vs. “lonely”—that reweights every prior image under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: the hum unlocks memory → memory prompts documentation → documentation reframes solitude → reframing enables independence. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; the library’s rules remain consistent. The only cost is the continuing fade of the memories themselves, visible on the final page, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal library is not backdrop but instrument: its rising shelves dictate where Maren can move, and the rope bridges she builds in response literalize her transformed stance. The brass sundial’s atomically reflective face functions as micro-setting that captures extinct light, directly enabling the archive that reframes exile. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“hum entered her bones,” “books surfacing and submerging”). One hairline slip: the phrase “no one had ever explained” momentarily abstracts the library’s origin without pressing the character need.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will she salvage identity before the memories evaporate—tightens when the sundial’s capture proves finite and the daily loss accelerates. Agency is continuous: she angles the dial, maps tides, bridges shelves, each act narrowing the option of passive exile. The final shift from “survived” to “living” forecloses victimhood at the cost of accepting perpetual memory erosion. No reversal is declared, but the accrual of small forfeitures supplies sufficient escalation under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: extinction as mirror for personal erasure, solitude re-priced as voluntary territory rather than imposed sentence. The great auk’s eye and the pigeon-darkened sky carry the weight of loss without sermon. The closing distinction between “alone” and “lonely” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One minor echo of prompt language (“brittle awakenings”) is quickly absorbed into dramatized experience, not abstract thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Maren’s perceptual signature—she reads shelves like a sailor reads the sea, notices feather weight but not library foundation. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into tool-making action without register drift. No dialogue appears; the interior voice sustains rhythmic variety and idiosyncratic diction. The single POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes while supplying tactile detail (“atomically reflective, polished to a precision that made it function less as a timekeeper and more as a mirror”). Metaphors are coherent and sparse, never stacked in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or filter-verb clusters appear. Opening and closing lines are sharply etched and propel momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The floating tidal library, reincarnation memory that surfaces only to vanish, and brass mirror that arrests extinction’s after-image synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. The concept commits fully: no safety-net exposition explains the library’s engineers or the stones’ physics, keeping wonder intact. Risk—extinction as personal memory loss—pays off in the final redefinition of solitude. The story would collapse if any of these elements were swapped for stock equivalents.</comment>
