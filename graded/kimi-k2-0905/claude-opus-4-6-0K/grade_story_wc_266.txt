<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—clinging to the urn vs. stepping into fog—are dramatized in embodied beats (frayed leather warm in palm, ash cloud catching wind). The final release is earned by the ridge-descent micro-choices and the unsaid words finally spoken; cost is felt in the whispered ashes. Ferry guides act as pressure conduit, not relationship crucible, so status dynamics bullet is NA; still, their prompts force her micro-shifts. Voice-specific interiority holds; no label-speak at climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: ashes flung, words released, stance shifted from waiting to "no longer waiting," cost legible in the star-punched ticket still rough in her pocket. Causal chain—leather snaps → dog vanishes → ferry appears → speech released—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each station-image thickens stakes until cadence breaks on the shore. Orientation clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: the hound’s absence keeps her moving; ticket stars reappear in final beat to reweight meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fog, ridge, and lantern constrain every step; the ferry shelter’s impossible placement reweights reality rule-set. Micro-setting of the urn against spine guides backpack choices; shoreline crescent receives ashes, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to wind-notes and sea-lullaby under emotional pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stones to shore; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—say the unsaid before ashes scatter—signalled by third paragraph. Mid-story tightening: ferry guides demand she articulate the unsaid, narrowing option to speak or remain stalled. Cost paid in the breath-release on shore; no off-stage resolution. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens via fog, stars, hound silhouette; not causal escalation but density intensification that forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken courage emerges through ash imagery and star punctures rather than exposition. Final image of shore receiving whisper reweights prior ferry dialogue about "passage" without moralizing. Subtext lives in ticket constellation glowing against dark—material trace of crossing. Ambiguity lingers: is ridge ferry real or psychopomp; complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter—wind singing low, leash warmth, salt taste. Syntax lengthens during descent to mirror gathering words, then fractures at ash release. No head-hop; ferry guides’ speech carries tidal cadence distinct from her interior rhythm. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure; elision of dog’s POV is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene: short clauses during ridge climb, longer lyrical sentences on descent. Figurative language is selective—fog like held breath, waves like lullaby—never crowding beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or motive. Opening and final lines act as lyrical brackets, recharging leash/break motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ridge-top ferry for "passage between selves" feels fresh against familiar ash-scattering arc; mythic layer grows organically from setting. Star-punched ticket transforms from mundane prop to constellation map—specific, non-generic. Dog as living memory trail avoids sentimental trope by remaining silent sentinel. Risk in magical realism pays off by crystallizing emotional transit without gimmickry.</comment>
