<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—professional caution vs. moral compulsion—are dramatized in the moment she re-shelves the original yet smuggles the scan. Her embodied tension (trembling hands, “dizzying quiet”) is specific, not diagnostic. The final act of anonymous transmission is a credible, costly renunciation of safety. Interiority stays within her cryo-archivist perceptual lens throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: discovery → choice → transmission. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sent data detonates “beneath the surface,” reconfiguring every citizen’s silence with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—the micro-scanner’s memory chip—shapes every tactical move. No causality breaks; the elevator beats tighten options precisely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minus-forty air, thermal gloves, and refrigerated hum are not backdrop: they dictate the micro-scanner’s viability and Maren’s finger-clumsiness. The snow-load ceiling becomes a burial metaphor that charges the final “ice shifting over deep water” image. Vault Seven’s spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene. Environment directly constrains the document-handling choices that drive the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal safety vs. national silence—tightens once: the elevator’s approach collapses infinite options to a binary (re-shelve or smuggle). Cost is visceral: perpetual fear of archival treason, loss of professional sanctuary. Agency drives the turn: Maren alone activates the dormant network. No coincidence; the letter’s mis-filing is prior state, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: complicity becomes unsustainable once intimacy-with-tyranny is documented. The final image of ice cracking under silent weight reweights every prior compliance as precarious. No moralizing—Vasek’s love letter itself is the irrepressible counter-argument to state mythology. Ambiguity lingers: scandal may liberate or merely drown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person cold-arxive voice—precise, tactile, scentless—mirrors Maren’s minus-forty world. Syntax tightens under pressure: “Within the blink that follows surprise, Maren made her choice.” No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature stays cryogenic—“air tasted of nothing at all.” Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textual: Pell’s “Quiet shift?” against Maren’s loaded “The quietest.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“a gram of data that could detonate a nation”) do double duty: concrete weight + metaphoric blast. Rhythm accelerates into the elevator beat, then exhales with snow settling. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line cadence reprises buried/crack ice motif with clean sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-archival-dissident synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Dormant relay nodes repurposed from deprecated infrastructure is a specific, non-obvious world detail. The love-letter-as-state-weapon re-inflicts the personal into political myth. Risky structural compression (single scene, off-stage transmission) heightens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
