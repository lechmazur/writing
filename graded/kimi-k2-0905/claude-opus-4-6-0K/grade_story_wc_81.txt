<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet precision and the tactile way she handles the stamp versus the Bureau’s scanner give her a believable interior life; the moment she pockets the data instead of uploading it crystallizes a cost-laden value hierarchy. Her lineage claim remains a vulnerable private stake rather than a triumphant label, satisfying the earned-stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blackout triggers a single-scene arc: blackout → forced slow attention → discovery → decision to withhold data; each beat is causal, culminating in a Charged Poise that reweights both family identity and institutional loyalty on the page. Orientation is swift and the lens (Causal) holds cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The library’s damp bones, pressure-creak, and bioluminescent hum are filtered through Maren’s cataloguer gaze, guiding her fingers to hidden stamps; the blackout strips the setting to touch-only, directly enabling discovery. The sunken city frame is economical yet specific enough to anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes (prove lineage vs finish Bureau quota) tighten when the blackout removes tech; her alternative-hypothesis search narrows options and finally costs her the safety of compliance. The single meaningful escalation is sufficient and protagonist-driven under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stillness graduates from imposed obstacle to deliberate methodology, letting silence revalue ancestry over institutional metrics; the theme emerges through pattern of withheld uploads and tactile reading without any explanatory sermon. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps a calm analytic cadence mirroring Maren’s indexer mind; diction (“pressure-sealed reading chambers,” “vaulted ceilings crusted with barnacles”) shows a perceptual signature anchored in professional attention. No head-hopping or register drift; blackout compression tightens rhythm appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause structure, carrying high density: each line advances either pressure, world, or character; no synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative choices (“city’s bones”) remain sparse and accurate, keeping the bioluminescent imagery vivid without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Genealogical sleuthing via antique stamp impressions in a drowned library feels fresh; blackout-as-enabler subverts expected tech rescue, and withholding data rebukes institutional recovery narratives. Specificity of publisher stamps anchors the concept so it couldn’t swap places with generic artifacts.</comment>
