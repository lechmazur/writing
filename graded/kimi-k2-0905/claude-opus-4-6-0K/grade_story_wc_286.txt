<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sable’s interiority is vivid—her clay-reader’s fingers on warped wood, her desert-learned patience—but the final “gift of presence” is not pressured by an opposing want; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the renunciation feels foregone rather than costly. The micro-choice to stay kneeling is consistent yet does not tighten stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the lantern beat layers timelines into a resonant reconfiguration—“the oasis existed in multiple moments simultaneously”—with conceptual cost (she abandons her original question). Early anchors clear; single transition from hive to lantern to stillness; closure lands as Charged Poise with reweighted premise. No causal break, though the timeline stack is exposition-heavy for <800 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass as micro-setting literally refracts choice; the scorched wasteland and stubborn green are sketched through motion (sun arc, flat smoke) and tactile detail (warped frame, seedling pressed into cracked earth). Spatial choreography clean; environment constrains the final decision to stay low. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why green persists—deepens when timelines reveal kindness as survival mechanism, narrowing her quest to witnessing. No antagonist; pressure is epistemic; cost is conceptual (her framing question collapses). One meaningful tightening sufficient; escalation reads as pattern-break rather than because/therefore chain. Price legible but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: mercy as phototaxis, small kindnesses as tectonic memory. Final image reweights “resistance to change” into “resistance to erasure,” a CR that feels inevitable yet non-moralizing. Subtext in gesture—stillness as aggressive attention—carries resonance. Avoids tidy thesis; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains perceptual signature of potter-attention (clay intuition, sun-path navigation). Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences yield to short final cadence. No dialogue; free indirect clean. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Minor register lift in “transparencies on an overhead projector” feels academic against otherwise earthy lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: “sun patterns the way a navigator follows stars” does triple work. No loops; metaphors coherent. One mixed image—“atmosphere wanted nothing rising today”—passes as personification. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm deliberate, paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ecological-fantasy premise—oasis as kindness-powered palimpsest—feels fresh yet grounded in ceramic craft lore. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off. Transformation test: story collapses without potter’s haptic lens. No derivative echo; specifics (lantern-as-lens, sun-tracking on charred earth) individuate.</comment>
