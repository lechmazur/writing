<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s survivor-guilt theology (“pressure into diamonds”) is embodied every beat—scarred knuckles, mycelium ritual, the moment she threads the bolt as talisman. Interior contradiction pulses: distrust of volunteers vs. need to matter. The final renunciation—placing the worthless diamond among the mushrooms—pays the full cost of her belief without sentimental payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: glitch texts → physicalized geometry → bolt-window → volunteer → collapse. Each turn shrinks escape routes; the bolt’s first appearance causes the second-act choice to peer through. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s market-null value reweights the entire premise; cost is the lifelong burden of every collapsed self.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The farm’s bioluminescent architecture steers every move—glow intensity cues rising danger, substrate yields the impossible bolt, blue light refracts through the final diamond. Spatial choreography never slips; distance from phone to oyster cluster to corner-shadow is tracked by touch. Setting literally becomes the pressure chamber that forges the diamond.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will abstract dread crystallise inside her?”—tightens geometrically: mushroom patterns harden, fear becomes stitched shadow. Mid-story bolt-viewing is the decisive tightening that forecloses disbelief. Cost is total bodily occupation by alternate lives; no reset, no saleable reward. Escalation obeys causal lens throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the hollowing-out of redemption capitalism: the only diamond worthless enough to prove suffering transcends markets. Subtext runs through haptic imagery—copper-star dust, warm worthless stone—never thesis. Final image scatters private light across a ceiling no buyer will ever see, reconfiguring value without declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays lashed to Maren’s sensory hierarchy: fungal scent, cold substrate, vertebra frost. Compression (“geological collapse”) mirrors tectonic pressure without losing clarity. Glitch orthography is pattern-taught early and paid off when text finally clarifies post-merge. Rhythm accelerates toward the one-breath final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence drags light or grit into the next (“mushrooms didn’t promise returns. They just grew”). Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—copper-starlight, dark embroidery—never muddling causality. Clause variation propels the geological final beat without overwritten crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Flips the multiverse rescue trope into anti-capitalist parody: the survivor of one pyramid joins a quantum merger that produces an unsellable gem. Bolt-as-wormhole, mycelium-as-fiber optics, glitch-as-moral Morse—all synthesized through tactile farm labor. Risky structural compression pays off in inevitability.</comment>
