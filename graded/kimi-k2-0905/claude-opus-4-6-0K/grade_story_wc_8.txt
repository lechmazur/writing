<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s historian training shows in concrete micro-choices (photographing the folio, deciding on parallels), but the emotional reckoning with her grandmother’s silence is stated more than embodied; the final “work finally done” tag feels tidy rather than paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: petal falls → solicitor’s cue → lockbox → decision to publish via parallels; the rosebush-as-timer and grandmother’s embargo supply visible cost and constraint, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with the ivy curtain image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thornfield station is sharply etched—ivy as “slow green tide,” dust shaken from rafters by a distant train—and the illuminated letter’s tactile ridges ground the turning beat; environment does not force a physical choice but charges the final image enough to meet the 9- gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (protect vs expose the lie) and tighten when Maren realizes the town’s benevolence is mortgaged to the myth; escalation is single-track but sufficient, with the cost of public exposure foreshadowed by her grandmother’s 1971 defeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moral calculus of “noble lies” emerges through juxtaposed miniature paintings and lived civic benefits, not lecture; the ending’s refusal to moralize lets the irony breathe, though the rosebush-petal metaphor edges close to pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Detached academic diction mirrors Maren’s emotionally rational stance, modulating only in the tactile moment her palm meets the lapis ridges; no head-hop, no filter clutter, rhythm remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty (information + atmosphere), rhythm shifts mirror reveals, and only minor脚手架 (“she understood… she understood”) repeats; no mixed metaphors or register drift, closure image unobstructed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The “fictional historian” premise refreshes the familiar “foundational myth” trope; embedding the Ashworth forgery inside a monk’s stolen initial feels specific and memorable, though the parallels method is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>
