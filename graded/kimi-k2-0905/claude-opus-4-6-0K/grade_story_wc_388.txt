<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s skeptical-methodical interiority stays vivid—‘she didn’t believe in curses… she believed in evidence’—and her kneeling choice to witness rather than debunk is earned by the orchard’s impossible data. Minor slip: the reversal feels slightly rushed; a half-beat more embodied cost would sharpen the pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the diamond beams captured light and Maren begins a witness-record—an Earned Stasis that swaps her vocation from dismantling to preserving. Causal chain intact: shredded letters → Malcara stone → orchard → stillpoint → stance flip; each step paid for on the page. Cost is visible—her lifelong epistemology abandoned in a silent dust-column.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Orchard’s silver-gray bark, bruise-dark apples, and ochre-violet dust curtains are selectively etched and tethered to Maren’s scientist eye. The stillpoint column itself serves as micro-setting that physically stops particles, directly constraining the final choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs comfortable lie—signalled early, tightens when the dust-free column confronts her; agency manifests in kneeling to write rather than dissect. One micro-reversal suffices at this length; cost is legible in forfeited professional identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth can outrun explanation—emerges through apple anomaly and light-capturing flaw, never sermonized. Final image of diamond hoarding light offers resonant non-literal answer; ambiguity persists, inviting reflection without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Detached observational diction mirrors Maren’s skeptic; rhythm accelerates into fragmentary half-sentences as storm arrives. No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct—numbers, paper grain, refraction angles—held stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lean, high-density sentences seldom repeat; “dust didn’t move” and “light… forgot to exhale” condense wonder without purple overload. Occasional elevated register (“ochre and violet”) stays within POV’s descriptive licence and pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-collapse wasteland, cursed-gem lore, and physics pause feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Conceptual integrity maintained: stillpoint rule seeded via letters, realized in orchard, crystallized in diamond—no late rule patches.</comment>
