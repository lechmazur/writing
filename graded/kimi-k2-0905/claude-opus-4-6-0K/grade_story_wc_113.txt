<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s need to “play the margins of a dead man’s program” is rendered in embodied, contradiction-laden beats (case overhead, knees in black water, bow tremor). Interiority stays concrete, never drifted into label-speak; “in-between space” obsession drives every micro-choice and earns the final renunciation—he plays, then falls silent. Cost is felt in the lowered baton stain; no causal break. Only cap: secondary pressure is entirely architectural, no live character to test status, hence stays just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: flood → reveals program → Marcus deciphers → plays → stain shifts. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no prop teleport. Closure lands as Charged Poise: music ends, baton image lowered, cost legible in the still water. Persistent constraint (building’s drowning) shapes tactics throughout; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded pit, lanterns, and buckled plaster are filtered through Marcus’s cellist gaze; every sensory pick serves his emerging score. Water as “artist” and shifting watermark-face directly constrain the final image—baton stain lowers because he played. Micro-setting (cello, program) handled tactilely in multiple beats. No spatial drift; environment evolves with rising water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“finish Vane’s silenced work”—is signaled early and tightened once: improvisation becomes commitment when the watermark conductor “turns.” Cost visible in hush aftermath; option to remain merely spectator is foreclosed. Escalation causal under lyric lens; no coincidence used to resolve. Sufficient for length, though only single major turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “music existing only in overlooked interstices” emerges through concrete pattern: pit as liminal space, margins of program, space between sound and silence. Final lowered-baton image reweights all prior interstitial imagery without moralizing. Subtext in water-stain faces and lantern ripples stays implicit; no thesis line. Resonance lingers as conceptual cost—he can never un-hear the completed piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Marcus’s perceptual filter; diction (“music move through his body like weather”) stays cellist-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for submerged calm, staccato fragments when bow meets string. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Filter verbs (“seemed to”) appear twice but are voice-motivated uncertainty, not leakage.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “lantern light…turning the space into something between a cathedral and a shipwreck” does three jobs in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language thins during the playing beat to let action drive. Sentence variety supports momentum; opening and final lines frame with precision. One minor adjective stack (“restless copper waves”) allowed because pattern-taught early.</comment>

<comment>Premise fuses ghost-code, flood-art, and liminal musician into an inevitable synthesis not seen before. Risk of flooded-building gothic is transcended by specificity of orchestration lore and water-as-ink reveal. Final image of lowered baton reconfigures whole text in hindsight. Feels singular, not prompt-stitched; could not swap names/places without collapse.</comment>
