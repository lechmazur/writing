<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her hands “knew heat and timing,” her lungs sync with the fog’s pulse—yet the dream-loss wound is only asserted, not dramatized in a prior beat. The final choice to “become part of the fog” is tracked through breathing micro-action, so renunciation feels earned, but the missing early dream-scene keeps the emotional cost slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirror-threshold imagery thickens until the improvised sextant reweights the stake—distance between waking/dreaming collapses into a sensation, not a number. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new mirror’s perpetual glass-mountain glow lingers as undeniable conceptual cost; she has traded solitary reflection for permanent threshold. Frost-sealed crack on the abandoned sextant is the visible constraint that persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fog-as-lung, frost-rimed branches, and the cracked sextant create a tactile micro-setting that directly enables the synchronized-breathing tactic; environment is not backdrop but instrument. “Silver and sand” kiln detail anchors profession without exposition dump. Spatial track stays clean: doorway → clearing → stump → workshop, each object handled, never floating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost dream—is signaled early and tightens when she decides to recreate rather than chase. One meaningful deepening: sextant’s broken angle shifts from junk to purposeful “fracture in the world,” forcing her breathing experiment; cost is the irreversible threshold state she now inhabits. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasing maker/made boundary emerges through mirrored recursion—mirror as threshold, fog as crystallized mountain—never lectured. Final image of warm glass mountains breathing inside the mirror reweights earlier “mirror is not a reflection” line without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the abandoned, frost-healed sextant: knowledge tools become obsolete once perception is rewritten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter—“thick as wet wool,” “skeletal trees”—syntax lengthens and breathes with the fog pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythm; diction stays within her artisan lexicon. Filter verbs (“she thought she saw”) are minimal and motivate immediate sensory test. Final paragraph’s quieter cadence mirrors the earned poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and metaphoric work—“ice clung to branches that had not borne fruit in centuries.” Only minor scaffold: “every morning… every evening” frame could compress, but rhythm justifies. No mixed metaphors; figurative language clusters at hinge moments, not every line. Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence variety supports breath-based climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fog-district, mirror-craft, and dream-mining feel fused rather than checklist-assembled. Transforming fog into glass mountains via breath-sync converts atmospheric exposition into plot engine—fresh inflection that is inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in lyric accumulative structure; it pays off in a resonant reconfiguration without gimmick. Could edge higher with one more specific artifact of Maren’s trade repurposed in the ritual.</comment>
