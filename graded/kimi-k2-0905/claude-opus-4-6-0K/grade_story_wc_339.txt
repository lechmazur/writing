<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is piercingly specific—"she attended to death…with resigned familiarity"—and every reflection is tethered to on-page handling of the snow globe or dive log. The twin-loss wound and analytic armor collide in the final beat: she cradles the globe again, repeating "steady" while knowing containment always fails; the cost is legible. No diagnostic label-speak; every thought is embodied through salt-rot, brass, pulp sculptures. Character remains flawed, unstereotyped, and the refusal to sentimentalize letting go is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of library decay, snow-globe sediment, and radio silence layers tighten until the final image reweights "letting go" as acceptance of permeability. Closure is Charged Poise—the tilted globe re-enacts the ship’s surrender while foreclosing her fantasy of final messages. Orientation anchored by word 27 ("SS Meridian had been underwater…"); no后期 disorientation. Cost is undeniable: the sealed lighthouse already admits seawater, proving her quest can only end in stasis, not retrieval.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken library and snow globe together function as micro-setting that constrains every move—she must dive, log, and finally accept that glass cracks. Sensory hierarchy is scientist-cold: pulp sculptures, swollen oak, brass frozen mid-spin. Pacific indifference outside the hull mirrors her internalized grief without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: deck above, library below, globe passed hand-to-hand under lab lights.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the physics of last transmissions—tightens when each artifact (globe, compass, transcript) proves containment impossible. One meaningful deepening: the globe’s internal water replaced by ocean literalizes her fear that no message stays sealed. Agency is attention and notation; the cost is renunciation of rescue fantasies. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but the final tilt of the globe reweights stakes with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulate detail: vanished voices, dissolving spines, sediment snow. No authorial thesis—idea that "containment is temporary" arrives only through the cracked globe’s final image. Sophisticated melancholy suffuses every sentence without curdling into pessimism; ambiguity survives. The lighthouse inside a lighthouse (globe inside library inside ship) reconfigures meaning without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is scientist-poet: precise nouns ("porcelain lighthouse," "glycerin") yet rhythmic melancholy ("confessions whispered too long"). Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under data—mirrors dive/ surface cycle. No filter-verb stacks; perception is tactile: globed water "shifted with a patience that mimicked snowfall." Register stays inside a marine archaeologist’s lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Opening line anchors stakes instantly. Metaphors are coherent: "confessions whispered too long" sustains auditory decay inside a library. No register drift; punctuation clean. Final paragraph varies sentence length to create cadence of acceptance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing Earhart, snow globe, and deep-sea library feels inevitable in hindsight—each a sealed microcosm breached by time. Risk of sentimental "message in a bottle" trope is averted by scientist’s refusal to anthropomorphize the ocean. Specificity of pulp sculptures and brass compass transforms familiar disappearance theme into tactile ontology of loss. Conceptual repricing—the world releases you, not vice versa—arrives freshly through object arc, not declaration.</comment>
