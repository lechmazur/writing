<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable’s prism-minded trait is shown through her seven-way reading of the doodle and the immediate, embodied choice to bolt magnetized crampons to her boots; the final beat of snatching a manuscript with more maps crystallizes her vigilance at visible cost (time running out). Interiority stays concrete (“pressure of something about to ignite” vs. diagnostic labels). No second character on-page, so relationship bullets N/A; solo arc earns credible endurance with stakes legibly paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library spills, nineteen-minute countdown locks in undeniable cost, and Sable’s stance shifts from seeker to bearer-of-fire. Causal chain intact: doodle → coordinate → grotto → inversion → wheel → manuscripts. Orientation clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One causal tightening suffices at this length; no off-stage cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment (glowing stone that “shines only for those who know not to look directly”) directly constrains perception and thus her stealthy approach; magnetized boots and mist pooling on the ceiling are tactile obstacles that shape each step. Specificity is selective, not touristic; grotto geometry mirrors the margin doodle, fusing setting with plot engine. Micro-setting (boots, wheel, manuscripts) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve forgotten knowledge before gravity reverts—signaled early and tightened by the one-hour inversion clock. Agency visible: she turns the wheel, triggers the library, accepts the nineteen-minute death-line. Cost is on-page and persistent (time, physical risk, irreversible exposure). No coincidence resolves; escalation driven solely by her prior deciphering and present actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance-through-reversal emerges from the spatial grammar of the grotto and the inversion mechanic, never sermonized. Final image—doodles as living maps—reweights earlier “idle” margins into perpetual obligation. Ambiguity remains: knowledge is fire, bearer may burn. No thesis statement; resonance arises from the concrete ticking clock and the upward-falling water.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight focalization; perceptual signature (“fractured light,” “directionless air”) is prism-specific and consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during inversion, longer reflective curls in backstory. No head-hop; diction stays within scholar-mystic lexicon. Final smile is earned, not ventriloquised.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water fell upward in silver threads” does triple sensory-causal-metaphor duty. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings; strong verbs anchor each move. Figurative language peaks at the chamber exhale but clears for the final beat, preserving clarity. Minor alliteration (“seeds of vigilance”) reads intentional, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines archival noir with inverted physics in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen; gravitational theology and combinatorial wheels are more than set-dressing—they dictate plot mechanics. Margin doodle as living atlas transforms the cliché of “hidden map” into iterative, endless cartography. Risky inversion centerpiece is fully committed to, not retreated from. Specificity throughout prevents generic swap-out.</comment>
