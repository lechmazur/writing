<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sable’s embodied trembling and micro-choice to open the case mid-ridge give credible interiority; the final still-hands beat shows earned change. Missing is any contradictory impulse under peak pressure—she never considers turning back or abandoning the relic—so the arc feels single-track. Reflection blocks stay anchored and tilt her present stance, meeting BRR rules. A second character or status crucible is absent, permissible at this length but limiting relational depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s germination crystallizes “sustained attention” as the new rule-set, with conceptual cost that her name will vanish while the wonder persists. Causality holds: tremor ⇒ resonance ⇒ aurora coupling ⇒ growth, each because/therefore link visible. Orientation is clear by line 19. One minor loop: “she had discovered this on the first night…” is told, not shown, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ridgeway, auroras, and dragonfly case function as micro-settings that actively constrain action—she must kneel, vent the case, adjust her pace. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (shivering silk, humming sternum). The warm case against bone charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. No spatial drift; weather and light directly shape the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver relic intact—tightens when the aurora feedback threatens to sing the pendant loose, forcing the choice to expose it to wind and light. Agency is present and causal, but the cost is primarily conceptual (memory erasure) rather than immediate physical jeopardy, capping intensity just below the 8.5 band. One meaningful deepening occurs at the seed-germination beat that reweights her mission from courier to witness. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—“sustained attention as transformative force”—emerges through germinating seeds and the final image of green leaves trembling in step, never sermonized. Subtext resides in the tension between ephemeral aurora and enduring relic, echoed in personal oblivion versus lasting wonder. The reconfiguration lands without moralizing, offering plausible counter-readings (is she merely a conduit?). No motif checklist; dragonfly and ridge accumulate meaning naturally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly glued to Sable’s perceptual filters—temperature of case, drone in ears, tremor in fingers. Syntax mirrors her shaky state with controlled fragments (“She smiled—”). No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts smoothly under stress. Distinct texture in word choice (“veined with channels that caught even the faintest vibration and sang it back”). Dialogue is absent, permissible and here wisely omitted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during the aurora climax, then lengthen in the reflective descent. High information density—each paragraph advances either tremor-physics or emotional stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter recharging “Tuesday” as anti-myth. Minor filter verb in “she realized” could slice, but does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy courier trope is refreshed by the pendant’s non-weaponized function—extending encounters rather than unlocking gates. The aurora-seed bridge is a fresh synthesis of hard-light biology. Risk is moderate: quiet epiphany instead of thriller stakes, but coherence stays intact. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost (lost finger to frost, say) to raise jeopardy originality.</comment>
