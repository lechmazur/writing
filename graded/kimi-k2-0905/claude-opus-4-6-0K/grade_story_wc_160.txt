<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—love for a father who caused deaths—stays vivid in the breathing-stone present, but her final resolve is reported rather than embodied; the tremble is the only micro-choice we watch. The “encrypted compassion” motif is intellectually neat yet never complicates her on-the-spot tactics. Competence is clear, but struggle is off-stage; we are told she will “keep the floodgates running,” not shown the moment she decides with the letter in her fist. Cost is asserted, not dramatized, so the change feels moderate, not earned at high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tight causal spine: envelope → chain → cipher → confession → new stance. Orientation is clean by 120 words; lens (Causal) holds to the end. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she re-weights the floodgates as encoded apology—but the decisive beat is summarized (“she folded…would carry both truths”), not dramatized, softening cost visibility. No causal breaks, yet the climax lacks a present-tense pivot that locks the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The amphitheater’s exhalations are an active character: warm sulfurous breath steams the letter, coats her shoulders, times the beats. Micro-objects—resin glue, brass links—function as setting inside her hands, constraining decryption choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s engineer eye (torque, millimetres, basalt cracks). Final image of “gray morning light” is generic, preventing 9-level charge, but volcanic haze and shifting seats remain vivid and causally utilized throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep tending a system built on her father’s guilt—emerges only after cipher reveal; prior tension is investigative, not ethical. One tightening: decoding converts abstract grief into concrete filial betrayal, forcing her either to quit (punish father) or stay (protect strangers). Decision is announced, not tested in a beat where refusal would cost lives now; thus pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Cost is retrospective (eleven already dead), truncating forward stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: infrastructure itself can be penance, encoded by love and deceit. Subtext plays in the silent chain-against-glue match, not in exposition. Final image avoids moral tag; “real work of forgiveness” is left ambiguous. Slight abstraction in “conflicting pressures” phrase nicks immediacy, but complexity is honored without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays anchored in Maren’s engineer perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax skews technical—“monsoon surges,” “flood tolerances”—giving a distinct texture. Occasional elevated diction (“slyly heartfelt,” “encrypted compassion”) drifts toward thesis-speak, registering slightly above her vocational lexicon. Rhythm mirrors breathing vents with periodic long sentences, but cadence is not yet unmistakable signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry dual freight: action + sensory or emotional layer. Sparse figuratives keep clarity; only one mixed image (“ghost of an audience…standing ovation in reverse”) and it fits POV. Minor scaffold: “decrypted words” paragraph restates what we already infer from the chain-device, dulling momentum. No loops or register drift in closure; brevity keeps propulsion high despite that one paraphrase patch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Father-cipher revealed by antique survey chain is a fresh conceit; volcanic amphitheater as confession booth gives mythic lift. Engineer-daughter inheriting encoded apology in hydraulic steel feels specific, not template. Yet core arc—parental sin discovered post-mortem via artifact—travels familiar terrain; emotional beats map predictably once envelope appears. Risk is moderate, not paradigm-shift, but local details (resin indentations) are memorable.</comment>
