<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s solitary vigil, precognitive burden, and death-bound promise give her a sharp, consistent interior edge; the moment she presses palm to star-dust the contradictory impulses—self-preservation vs. covenant—collide in one embodied beat, earning the stone-fate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the pattern completes, friction’s return is imminent, Maren becomes the final stone—cost paid on-page; causal chain (vision → promise → painted sequence → self-petrification) holds, though a micro-drag in mid-story reflection keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tidal bluff, sliding ocean, aurora-bruised gold, and the star-dust’s light-bending edge are filtered through Maren’s pattern-seeking gaze; the painted rocks function as micro-setting that literally anchors the world’s physics at the climax, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore friction or let the world drift—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each painted rock narrows her options toward self-sacrifice; the final placement is the irreversible turn that forecloses escape, cost legible in her petrifaction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic pattern vs. individual mortality emerges through spiral imagery and the Fibonacci stones; no moralizing—final image of Maren-turned-rock reweights the premise: order restored, body forfeited, meaning left vibrating in the reader’s chest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s precognitive sensorium; diction (“collapsed star dust,” “borrowed dawn”) is textured yet consistent; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm swells then compresses into the final stone-click, voice intact under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; only one soft loop (“pattern” twice in four lines mid-text) and a single mixed metaphor (“aurora… closer than it should be”) slightly dull the edge; closure line is clean, no scaffolding, strong verb-driven momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frictionless apocalypse rendered through eel-herding and Fibonacci rock art feels genuinely fresh; star-dust-as-anchor and self-petrification twist genre tropes into mythic physics; risk-taking (lyric numerology, cosmic stakes in 700 words) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
