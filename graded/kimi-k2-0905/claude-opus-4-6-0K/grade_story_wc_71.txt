<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—her obsessive noticing vs her need to belong—drives every beat; the final resolve to surrender her own worn object is earned by the accumulating pattern of returns. Embodied emotion stays specific (hand flat against inhaling door, violet musk on linen). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible NA; micro-choices under pressure (placing, returning, deciding to come back) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses act in scene and the renunciation is causally paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is declared by repeating object migrations and holds to the end; closure is a Charged Poise—she will return with her own relic, path foreclosed with felt cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) satisfied by word 60. No plot amnesia; every displaced object is tracked. Persistent constraint: the house’s memory hunger shapes her next move. Meets 9+ quick test: cost is legible in final silence-blaze image and lens never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-filtered: cherry blossoms without trees, brass knob on fence, violet musk—each later re-weighted in closure. Micro-setting (porch railing, door under palm) directly constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography clean across single continuous scene. Environment does not merely echo mood; it accumulates devotional repetition that charges the ending. Meets 9+ gate: the orris shard and porch rail as recurring objects constrain choice and charge final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some houses breathe—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the house inhales after she returns the shard, forcing her stance crystallization (she will donate her own relic). Cost is visible on page: she accepts permanent loss of her daily-touched object. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. High-band cost legibility met; no secondary reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: sanctification via stolen repetition. Final reprise of “hush” reweights earlier daydream hour—conceptual cost is undeniable (her life will now be mined for ritual). Resists moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the house’s hunger is benevolent. No thematic echo violation. Particulars (orris, child shoe, doorknob) carry the thesis without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is synesthetic noticing (silence with texture, taste of salt-sweet night). Syntax modulates: longer cadences for walking meditation, clipped fragments at inhale beat. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets NA. Free indirect clean: “she understood then, inadvertently profound…” aligns with POV lexicon. Meets 9+ quick test: distinct noticing bias and rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diversify. High information density: single sentences do setting + metaphor + interiority (“brass doorknob appeared on a fence post… a stolen hymn”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“provisional,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within narrator’s capable lexicon. Artifacts do not touch closure; no 9+ disallowance triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: domestic gothic meets anthropological theology of objects. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specific bay, orris shard, daydream hour are integral. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in hush-blaze closure. No derivative premise penalty; not a template haunted-house tale but a meditation on memory-as-prayer. Specific detail (perfumer relic, three-quarter-mast flag) creates memorable texture.</comment>
