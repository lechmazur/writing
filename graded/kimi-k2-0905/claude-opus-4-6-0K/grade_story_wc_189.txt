<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured—jade cicada as touchstone, refusal to argue data—but the “warmly observant” trait is asserted, not embodied in a beat that costs her. Micro-choice at the molting crab is strong; still, her stake never tightens past refusal, so the endurance feels more stance than change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: lost funding → personal plea → joint watch, each step because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses appeal and invites Dao to witness—but the cost (no more grants) is stated, not newly felt on page; lens stays clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Grotto pools, starlight shafts, crab carapace splitting—all filter through Maren’s taxonomic eye and constrain her method: show, don’t pitch. Micro-setting (jade cicada handled twice, salt on boots) charges the final image; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—continue chronicle without funds—tightens once: she pivots from request to witness, narrowing her tactic to shared attention. Cost is legible (she accepts loss of grant path), though external pressure stays verbal, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “transition as the real text” emerges through molting crab, cicada, and the slack-water pause between bad news and renunciation. No moralizing; final image crystallizes the concept without naming it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s marine gaze: “stone mouth,” “kingdom unto itself,” perceptual signature sustained. Syntax breathes with tidal rhythm; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, rhythmic, double-tasking: “the tide was turning…ancient grotto breathing in” propels and mirrors stance. Only micro-loop: “she knew…she knew” sentence stem early; does not recur near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Academic-funding-crisis is familiar, but refracted through intertidal chronotopia and the molting image it feels specific. Risk is quiet—no twist, only stance—yet the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
