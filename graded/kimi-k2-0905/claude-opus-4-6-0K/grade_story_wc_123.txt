<question>1</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete, instrument-bound, and weather-scaled; her decision to braid the pigeon’s data into her ledger is the earned, visible cost that seals her arc. No head-count or relationship crucible here, yet her solitary stance crystallizes under pressure with full causal backing.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the moment she copies the numbers into the ledger, truth is irreversibly fused to her archive, foreclosing silence at measurable personal risk. Causal lens holds throughout; each beat slides laterally along pressure ridges, tightening options until the final image reweights the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The courtyard fountain, bench, and dying light are not backdrop but instruments—sound of water replaces dialogue, dusk angle times her decision, stone surface steadies the ledger. Micro-setting charges the final image: ink meets page while the sky’s last color equals the cost she accepts.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve evidence of industrial concealment—tightens once: the follower’s presence converts observation into endangerment, forcing the archival act. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity, accepts future peril; escalation is single but sufficient under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from data-integrity-as-selfhood: weather logs become autobiography, truth braided into truth becomes undeletable identity. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing—ink dry on ledger, fountain speaking for her—achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omni stays disciplined, colored by Maren’s meteorological perceptual signature: pressure drops, starling patterns, sulfurous note. No head-hop, no filter bloat; diction remains within her calibrated lexicon, rhythm tightening as dusk deepens and decision lands.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence moves story, character, or micro-setting. Metaphors are weather-native and coherent—“silence is pressure waiting to equalize” charges closure without figurative muddle. High density, clean syntax, read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Storm-recorder-as-whistleblower is fresh; coupling barometric logs to archival resistance against a fake quarantine feels inevitable only after it lands. Pigeon tube reprises with reweighted meaning, turning meteorological obsession into political sabotage—risk taken, coherence intact.</comment>
