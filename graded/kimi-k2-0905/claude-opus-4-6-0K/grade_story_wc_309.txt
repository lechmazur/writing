<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cael’s underachieving-mage identity is embodied in every beat: the quiet shame of unstrapping the keystone, the decision to mist-walk precisely because the engines cannot. Interiority stays concrete—“his fingers were clumsy,” “keystone pulsed against his ribs”—and the final drift is a credible renunciation with visible cost: he leaves the measurable world for the unsellable. No other characters appear, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the self-vs-system crucible is sufficient.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its pattern early—linger with light, attend to the overlooked—and reweights the stake through density shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Cael sat on the observation ledge”). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the keystone’s glow and lingering luminance re-weight the Consortium’s rule-set, proving attention itself is non-automatable currency; cost is felt in the irreversible exit from quantified value.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Icebound spire, mist, and keystone form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: only here can mist-walk exist, only this stone can serve as axis. “Light didn’t behave…photons had nowhere else to go” is filtered through Cael’s mage-biased perception, not tourist catalog. The final image—keystone brighter than stars—recharges the vine-patterned limestone with sacrality, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove human attention irreplaceable. Escalation is textural—the mist’s luminous density increases until it reweights meaning—rather than a causal turn. Agency is the surrender itself, foreclosing return to the Loom cities. Cost is legible: permanent exile from measurable achievement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: sacredness = unautomated noticing. The keystone’s vine pattern, the refusal to quantify light, the mentor’s decommissioning—all accrue into a Conceptual Reprice that makes attention a counter-currency. Final image offers non-literal answer: stars are outshone by a carved weed because someone still attends. No moralizing, only reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean psychic distance; diction—“frozen argument,” “diffuse, directionless light”—is POV-apt for a mage who thinks in spatial metaphor. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments at the step-off, mimicking surrender. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; voice is distinctively Cael’s: precise yet yearning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical inversion to fragment without monotony; “linger with it” reprise creates ear-worm cadence. Figurative layer—“mist received him the way a cathedral receives a whisper”—is patterned early and paid off. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphor; register stays within Cael’s lexicon. Minor −0.1 for two “lingering luminance” repeats in final third, but they serve closural echo rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of artisanal keystone vs industrial Loom is fresh; mist-walk as non-reproducible surrender inverts standard techno-magic race. Risk—the entire climax is a quiet drift—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Specificity of vine-patterned limestone makes the sacred granular, not abstract. Transformation test passes: swap stone for generic crystal and the thematic engine collapses.</comment>
