<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s “scientifically romantic” nature is shown through tactile detail—naming furnaces after constellations, compressing light with a lover’s care—so the trait drives action, not merely labels. The interior contradiction (precision vs. yearning) is dramatized when she risks failure by abandoning extraction, embodying cost. Cael’s off-page whisper is the fulcrum; because we only hear the advice, relationship pressure is second-hand, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine—“failed straight-line extractions → leave → collect shell → return changed” —delivers a decisive Conceptual Repricing: presence is bottled only after absence is folded in. Cost is visible in the sphere’s dense simultaneity and in the final kneel that concedes prior hollowness. The lens (Causal) is stable; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember nexus is not backdrop but thermal engine: vent-light rises through her fingers, guiding the spiral. Micro-setting (nautilus chambers) literally templates the compression flask, so environment constrains the final choice. Twilight inversion (light from below) is tethered to theme and stakes, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“capture presence or admit she’s never felt it”—intensify when the 17-mile walk forgoes immediate gain, trading time for possible meaning. One meaningful tightening: sealing the flask after the shell is inserted forecloses the old method; price is the years of failure compressed into the heavier sphere. Pressure stays causal and personal, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as presence = return, not arrival; the nautilus revalues each past chamber, mirroring the sphere that holds layered memories. Final image of stars as “someone else’s pocket-suns” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Cael’s whisper (“Just come back”) quietly reframes the entire alchemical quest, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is scientifically precise yet lyric—“reagents to the microgram… furnaces after constellations”—mirroring Maren’s bifurcated mind. Perceptual signature tightens under pressure: photons find “corridors through the curl,” showing mind-filtered physics. No head-hopping; compressed diction during sealing preserves clarity while heightening tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “ember-light rose through her fingers” advances action, atmosphere, and physics. One paraphrase loop—“she saw… and she saw… and she saw…”—dilutes the final image slightly but does not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates from reflective long lines to short pulses at the seal, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inversion of alchemy—from capturing light to capturing lived return—feels inevitable yet fresh. Pocket-sun tech, nautilus lattice, and volcanic nexus synthesize into a singular metaphoric system rather than ornament. Risk in structure (no antagonist, no dialogue) is embraced and pays off through lyric escalation, meriting the +0.2 risk bonus.</comment>
