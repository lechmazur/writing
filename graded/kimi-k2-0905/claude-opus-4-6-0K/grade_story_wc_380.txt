<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s obsession with “deleted memories” is visceral and embodied; the parallel between gravity wells and her mother’s erased mind gives every micro-choice stakes. She acts: lighting, kneeling, touching residue, brewing coffee, laying crystals beside flowers—each motion driven by the impossible want. Interiority stays specific (“gleaming silence felt architectural”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slack: we don’t feel her hesitate or fear failure, so the cost registers intellectually rather than somatically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The whale’s landing functions as causal trigger, the crystal chamber as single scene; orientation is immediate (“dock-side lantern lighter,” “Tuesday”). The climax—placing crystals beside pressed flowers—delivers a Charged Poise: options narrow to “maybe weight can become recognition” and the price (years of orphaned grief) is felt on the page. Causality is clean: because the whale beaches, gravity warps; because Maren reads coffee-ground rings, she exhumes crystals; because she matches them to flowers, remembrance coalesces. One hairline slip: the coffee-ground divination is introduced only at the critical moment, not seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, rusted stairs, encrusted halite, and the whale carcass are filtered through Maren’s technician-lantern gaze: she notices tilt, tension, scent of “brine and cognition,” never tourist excess. The salt chamber’s gleaming hush literally guides choice—crystals grow toward gravity wells she must harvest. Spatial choreography is clean: she descends, kneels, brews, climbs at dawn. The whale body on the waterline reappears at closure, re-weighted from colossal archive to empty husk, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—recover her mother’s memories—tightens the instant Maren links gravity pockets to the whale leak. The meaningful turn happens underground: she shifts from observer to “exhumer,” foreclosing the option to keep hunting forever; cost is the crystallized grief she must now carry home. Pressure is accumulative rather than multi-reversal, fitting the lyric lens. A slightly higher score awaits if we felt a live risk of failure inside the chamber.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as palpable equation: memory = mass = love. No character moralizes it; the whale, lanterns, flowers, and crystals keep iterating the same physics of loss. Final image—book “heavy with crystal”—reweights the earlier “gleaming silence” into portable, perilous hope. Ambiguity survives: recognition may never come, so the thematic answer stays charged rather than solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—“lanterns hang wrong,” “gravity shift around her ankles like water.” Syntax lengthens under salt-light awe, then shortens at dawn climb, mirroring stamina. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within coastal labor idiom except for one lyrical lift (“hush so bright it felt architectural”) that feels earned. Voice control justifies the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid anapests to staccato beats; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—“excavation” eyes, “architectural hush,” “tides in the air”—each image extends the gravity conceit without mixed-metaphor crash. Information density is high: one line often performs scene work, sensory grounding, and metaphoric reprise. Proofing clean; only nit is the late-introduced coffee-divination mechanic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The whale-as-memory-hard-drive isn’t new, but coupling it to fluctuating gravity pockets that can be “farmed” by salt crystals is a fresh synthesis. Using dock-lantern craft, coffee-ground tasseography, and Victorian flower-pressing as memory-tech makes the speculative feel artisanal, not borrowed. Conceptual risk—lyric accretion instead of plot reversals—pays off in the final hush. Transformation is complete: remove any one image (whale, lanterns, flowers, crystals) and the entire edifice collapses.</comment>
