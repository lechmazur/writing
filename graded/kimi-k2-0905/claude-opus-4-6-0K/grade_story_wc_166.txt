<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ereth’s interior contradiction—flight from erasure vs hunger for remembrance—is embodied in every slow dance; the glyphs’ burn on skin makes the cost visceral. Anchor-dissolution at the end is earned by the garden’s patient tuition, not epiphany. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flaw: “obsidian grace” is diagnostic label-speak in the climactic beat (−0.4).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density until the final glyph reweights exile into ascension. Orientation clean by line 5; violet hour and basin teach the pattern early. Closure is Charged Poise—she rises, garden darkens, tide weeps—cost legible in the dissolving anchor and last reflection held by stone. One micro-turn: anchor → fledge; no causal contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Garden’s perpetual dusk and star-drained basin constrain her only possible choreography; environment literally partners her dance. Micro-setting (granite basin) becomes the mirror that keeps her final image as proof. Sensory hierarchy favors starlight, rainwater, moss—each filtered through a dancer’s kinesthetic bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stone path to basin to sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve selfhood under ban on nostalgia. Pressure escalates through accretion of glyphs—each speck a visible criminal trace that could still doom her. Final ascent forecloses return: the cost is irreversible exile from human coastline and garden alike. One deepening, no false reversals; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: remembrance as metamorphosis, not indulgence. Gaps-as-grammar motif shifts from observation to vehicle of transcendence, reweighted in final ascension. No moralizing; the tide’s anonymous weep is the unstated ethical remainder. Image of basin holding her reflection “not as nostalgia but as proof” crystallizes the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains dancer’s kinesthetic diction—“coaxing a harbour into stillness with the slow grief of her hands.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for oceanic memory, clipped fragments during glyph ignition. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains anchored to Ereth’s proprioception. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—taught early, paid off in star-dance. One paraphrase loop: “not because she decided to, but because her body refused to go further” immediately restated as “spontaneously anchored” (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-dancing as mnemonic resistance, exile as astrophysical metamorphosis. Ban-on-nostalgia world rule is simple yet generates non-obvious stakes. Risky upward fledge avoids safe return-to-sea trope; garden-as-launchpad reconfigures plateau tropes. Specificity of glyphs on skin makes cosmic verse tactile, not abstract.</comment>
