<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her tactile weighing of the corpse-flower seed crystallizes both obsession and risk. The phone-call beat, however, arrives without visible cost or contradictory impulse; trust flips too cleanly, blunting the earned arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: seeds → mapped cities → saved comment card → recognition of sender → decision to call. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she crosses from defensive isolation to decade-long collaboration—though the final beat could sharper embody the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The creek’s post-storm hush and the lamp-lit pine table ground every cognitive turn; water’s continuous flow becomes an audible metronome for her risk calculus. The seed’s weight and rarity are not described but felt, forcing the final yes. Environment is leveraged, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Central stake—protect her artistic autonomy vs. gamble on a stranger’s decade-long puzzle—tightens the moment she deciphers the Savannah link. One meaningful escalation: the corpse-flower dare converts abstract admiration into concrete temporal cost, foreclosing the safer path of continued refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of patience-as-innovation emerges through seed botany and pop-up room history, never sloganized. Final image of listening beside flowing water quietly reweights “escape” from instant solution to lifelong cultivation, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Lena’s perceptual filter—orthogonal thinking, synesthetic seed heft, storm-born silence—creating a distinct cognitive texture. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments at recognition. No head-hop; voice stays taut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, scaffold-free; each sentence either advances puzzle logic or anchors sensory moment. Occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized possibility”) flirts with register drift but remains within Lena’s design lexicon and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Using rare botanical clues to stage an artisan’s emotional escape-room is fresh synthesis; the corpse-flower as temporal dare reframes franchise pressure into living art. The concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious, risking real time and reputation for both character and reader.</comment>
