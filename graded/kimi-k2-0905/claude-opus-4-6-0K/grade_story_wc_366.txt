<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s watchful reticence is embodied in every beat: she “catalogues suffering not to exploit it but to understand where tenderness might be quietly inserted,” then proves it by choosing to haul oil alone. The pocketed sea-glass warms against her ribs—tactile proof that her mercy has a cost. Her final cairn is a micro-choice that forecloses the path home; she is now the keeper of someone else’s grief. Only the absence of on-page error keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each discovered cairn thickens the pattern until the lantern’s re-ignition becomes a Resonant Reconfiguration—light reweights the tower’s meaning from haunted to shared vigil. Causality is lyric but coherent: because Einar’s ghost stacked “remember me,” therefore Maren answers “I am here,” and the cost is her biweekly lifelong sentence, felt in the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern room is rendered through sensory triage—brine, iron, fractured lens-suns—each detail filtering Maren’s professional eye. The sea-glass recurs as micro-setting: pocketed, warmed, finally re-set in her own cairn, constraining her to return. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her climb, her kneeling on iron, the deliberate placement of three stones. Environment directly guides the closing choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the dark at bay—tightens with each unread cairn; the pattern’s ache escalates from mystery to shared obligation. The midpoint fracture of the lens into “a thousand tiny suns” crystallizes the pressure: light itself is endangered. Maren’s agency is the manual re-priming; the visible price is the unspoken lifelong contract sealed by her own three stones. One more beat of external resistance (weather, maritime bureaucracy) would have pushed this to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety is a communal artifact that outlives the keeper’s body. The stone lexicon shifts from elegy to covenant—meaning is re-priced when Maren’s final cairn repurposes the same grammar to promise continuity. No moral is declared; the lamp’s steady glow and the unanswered letters offshore let the reader feel the cost of silent stewardship. Resonance is inseparable from the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual signature—“light seen through water,” “color of a held breath”—without poetic overflow. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens during the two-hour relight, mirroring physical effort. No dialogue appears; absence is apt for a woman who “learned that most words dissolved.” Voice remains coherent and pressure-responsive, missing only the finest knife-edge control required for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “the darkness that filled the lantern room was not empty” launches stakes and metaphor in one blow. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler; every sentence advances image or action. The single clause “humming grief that was almost beautiful” risks softness but earns its keep by naming the story’s tonal core. Closure line “The lamp never flickered out again” lands with monosyllabic finality—zero artifact, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing ghost story with maritime stone-code feels inevitable yet fresh; the trope inversion—haunting as plea, not threat—grows from Maren’s specific reticence. Detail like gulls avoiding the western face roots the supernatural in observable ecology. Risk-taking is present but safe; the piece could have pushed the stone-language further into plot mechanics. Still, the synthesis of keeper lore, bereavement, and quiet heroism is memorably particular.</comment>
