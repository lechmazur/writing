<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s reversed-aging paradox is vividly embodied (smooth child-hands, ninety-three-year eyes) and her decision to withhold the lesson until Cael sees the interference pattern is a textured micro-choice that costs patience and authority. Cael’s grief is surfaced only at the end; until then he is a generic seeker, so the dyad never fully becomes a crucible. The final transfer-of-seeing lands with cost for both, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Cael’s grief is reframed—”they are the peak where the flat water sent its energy”—with unmistakable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the pond pattern first mirrors, then re-weights, the emotional stake. Only nit-pick: the grotto’s magnetic star-bending is introduced late yet used for the final beat, a hairline world-rule convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, iron-veined grotto, and star-spiraled light are sensuously filtered through Lira’s magnet-tugged sternum, guiding her heartbeat and the lesson’s timing. Every descriptive stroke doubles as instruction—”slow spirals that rose and lapped at the floating rock’s underside”—so environment constrains pedagogy. Spatial choreography is clean; the platform’s slow rotation is tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—”teach vanishing to appear”—is signaled early and tightened once: when Lira forces Cael to watch the canceling rings, the option of passive mourning is foreclosed. Cost is legible: Cael must re-allocate grief-energy into a new perceptual stance. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices for 600-word Accumulative track.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image shift: interference patterns = grief redistribution. No moralizing; the final line lets the stone fall “to somewhere new,” leaving the reweighting implicit. The withheld explanation enacts the very lesson it delivers, fusing form and meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at lyric middle distance, sycamore-hush cadence sustained without monotony. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the trance breath-line. Only dialogue is the sparse instructional exchange—each sentence pursues pedagogical goal and carries sycamore stillness, so voice remains singular and un-contaminated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “a sound like a single syllable of truth” does triple sensory-conceptual work. No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language appears <40% of peak beat and is pattern-taught. Minor hedge: “appears to have vanished” could lose “to have,” but compression is already near-optimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reversed-aging mentor + magnetic star-grotto + wave-interference pedagogy synthesizes into a fresh grief-metaphor unavailable in stock templates. The withheld-lesson structure risks workshop familiarity, but here it is ontologized by Lira’s backward life—she literally cannot give the answer too early. Risk heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
