<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—her claimed acceptance of impermanence vs. her compulsive need to “map” the vanishing words—drives every beat; the embodied shiver when she hears her mother’s forgotten word is sharply particular. Yet the moment she names the ache, the prose slips into diagnostic shorthand (“the unlearning was not an ending”), letting abstraction steal the cost that had been accruing in her fingers and lungs. The final chalk glyphs are a credible renunciation, but the interior flash that earns it is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early—language erodes like rain on glass—and holds: each new ring of sand thickens the density until the tile flake breaks the pattern. The closure is a legit Charged Poise: the hush is reweighted from ominous absence to “achingly full,” and Sable’s chalk smudges crystallize the trade-off (she can keep meaning only by abandoning permanence). Orientation is clean—grotto, mist, tile acoustics all anchored by line 60. Only niggle: the mother-word is revealed via found object, not earned choice, so the cost is felt but not self-propelled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto itself functions as the micro-setting that constrains every tactic: sound spirals redirect her movements, the lilac mist literally colors her final palette, and the tile flake supplies the only viable “ink” for her new alphabet. Tourist-ruin details (ceramic scallop, abandoned coin box) are filtered through her chalk-trained eye for impermanence. Spatial choreography stays crisp: sand rings expand outward, flake drifts to exact center, chalk smudges ascend wall—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she keep meaning alive as language dies?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates as each ring of sand records another lexical casualty. The midpoint tightening arrives when the tile flake delivers a word she cannot pronounce; that micro-turn forces her to speak back to the grotto, narrowing her options from observer to participant. Cost is visible: the mandala’s sand trembles, re-patterning itself beyond her control—her cartography is overwritten by the very silence she sought to map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of entropy: what looks like loss is actually molting into a deeper lingua franca of gesture and hush. The lilac shift in mist color and the chalk shapes that “make you feel the way a lullaby sounds” enact the conceptual repricing instead of explaining it. No moral is stated; the final image of “one beautiful smudge at a time” lets impermanence become the carrier of permanence, a paradox that lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Sable’s perceptual signature—sound arrives “altered,” color is judged like chalk pigments, verbs such as “ricocheting” mirror her sidewalk art’s ephemeral bounce. Syntax lengthens during mandala work, then fragments when the tile hums, matching respiratory rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; the final neologistic glyphs are presented as sensory fact, not authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric clauses mimic whisper circulation, then staccato fragments when the flake drops. Information is dense—“spirals that suggested laughter, geometric voids that felt like grief” does triple duty (setting, emotion, theme). One metaphor mis-step: “compressed into a frequency just below hearing” is physics hand-waving, but it occurs pre-climax and doesn’t obscure the final image. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “language unlearning” premise feels freshly synthesized from real linguistics and street-art transience; the mandala-as-seismograph is an organic invention rather than borrowed trope. Risk is taken by making the climax a hush, not a shout, yet coherence holds. Minor echo of “Hush” tropes (Buffy, The Haunting) but transformed through chalk poetics and iridescent acoustics.</comment>
