<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s gentle meticulousness is embodied in every beat—cataloging, cross-referencing, climbing with burned fingers—so the trait genuinely constrains action and earns the ending’s quiet triumph. Interiority stays concrete (“precision was a form of prayer”) and avoids label-speak. The only limit is scope: no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested, so the arc is more confirmation than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the matched vow flares, warms her skin, and re-weights the world’s dying language; cost is felt in the translucent shelf she must leave behind. Causal chain—slide → sampler → match → descent—holds without ellipsis breaks. Orientation is swift: frozen library above clouds, no doors, nine-day climb, all inside 120 words. One micro-turn (opaque shelves → single chime) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library itself acts as a micro-setting that constrains every move: quartz hush presses eardrums, rungs burn, crystallized pages must be read before they opacify. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s archivist priorities—she notices translucence, resonance, thermal trace—so description never stalls momentum. The shifting corona on the slide reappears at the end as warm light against skin, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove one promise survived”—is signaled early and tightened when every shelf returns silence except the single chiming match; that narrowing constitutes meaningful escalation under an Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: the vow endures, yet the library continues fading, so her proof is only a stay, not a save. No reversal or opponent is needed; the fade itself supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is not restored wholesale but momentarily located in one fragile resonance that outlives its speakers. The luminous vow’s final soft flare reconfigures the premise—language can survive oblivion if measured with reverence—delivering Conceptual Repricing. No moral is preached; the warm light against skin is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“quartz hush,” “thread of vapor”) is specific to an archivist-poet who experiences cold as data. Syntax lengthens during cataloging, then shortens under the climb, mirroring breath control. No dialogue appears; voice stays coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “shelves of crystallized parchment rose into a vaulted ceiling lost in frost and pale light” performs three jobs—image, scale, mood—in one breath. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; figuratives stay physical (vapor like punctuation, hush like deep water). Occasional elevated register—“luminous vow,” “architecture of the dissolving world”—is justified by concept-driven stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Frozen library above the clouds” housing every vow as crystallized waveform is a fresh synthesis of archive and apocalypse tropes. The Dissolution—language evaporating upward like heat—reverses the usual entropy metaphor and charges every beat. Risk lies in the abstract premise, but specificity of the sampler’s copper rings and the warming corona grounds it.</comment>
