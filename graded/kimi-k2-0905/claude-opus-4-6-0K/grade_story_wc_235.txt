<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid (“jealous of the woman on the ridge”) and embodied; micro-choice (closing eyes to re-enter dream) aligns with motive. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Memory-scramble trait stays consistent, but final renunciation drifts to summary rather than dramatized cost, capping earn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scroll-making → dream ingestion → grave return taught early; closure lands with Charged Poise (final image of simultaneous living selves) that reweights prior chaos. Orientation clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Cost legible in “the bark would hold the dream… permanently,” though slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Birch bark, cabin gaps, and Elkhorn Peak act as micro-settings that filter choices (writing surface, wind intrusion). Tool/body constraint met: headlamp circle vs. scroll curl mirrors narrowed focus. Sensory economy tight; weather and spatial anchors persist without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—impose narrative order on collapsing memory—signaled in para 5. One deepening: seeing the grave → barricading + writing; no further tightening. Agency is accumulative (each scroll adds density) rather than a decisive turn; cost felt abstractly. Sufficient for length, but lacks visible price that alters next tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “jaded wonder” emerges through image sequence (modest grave, bark rot, feral nostalgia) rather than statement. Final image crystallizes ambiguity: simultaneous aliveness/death without moral. No echoic thesis line; resonance built from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ranger lexicon, topographic-map memory, synesthetic “smell of pine pitch and mouse droppings.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long clauses for nostalgia, blunt fragments for grave fact. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; free indirect clean, filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences deliver sensory, emotional, world data without pad. Two adjacent “had” clusters in memory paragraph but pattern teaches retrojection, so waived. No mixed metaphors; final image (“air would hold them”) precise. minor scaffold: “the wind shushed” repeated; does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—encountering own grave then chronicling dreams on bark—feels fresh; lucid-dream trope repurposed as archival compulsion. Specific ranger ecology and bark-rot metaphor prevent generic overlay. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; not derivative. Could push further if grave’s physical detail offered stranger irrefutability.</comment>
