<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (breathing as key to memory release). The camera-obscura choice externalizes her stance: receiving, not interpreting. One decisive micro-choice—staying to expose the print—unlocks the stored grief, but the cost (acknowledging centuries of buried tenderness) is felt more than dramatized, keeping her shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (scent, humidity, inverted image) tightens the stake until the print’s extra teardrop reweights the premise. Closure lands as CR—the bead’s “unused love” concept is repriced by the print’s un-asked-for flare. Orientation clean by 120 words; one shard, no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Viaduct, wisteria, and camera body act as micro-settings that constrain movement and frame the final image. Moist air and twilight directly affect exposure time, marrying atmosphere to craft. Tool-as-setting qualifies and charges the final image; specificity is high, though spatial choreography is lightly skimmed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving stored, unspent love—tightens once: the breathing beat releases the memory and forecloses denial. Under Accumulative lens, density (scent, humidity, inverted light) escalates until the print’s anomaly crystallizes cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The theme emerges via imagistic accumulation: inverted light, calcified compassion, the teardrop flare. No explicit thesis; final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost—unused love now visibly breathing in silver. Resonant without moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—brass fittings “catching copper light” is hers, not scenic. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then shortens on intake of breath, mirroring aperture and diaphragm. No head-hop; patterned diction (“pilgrim of sparks”) taught early and reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with emotional aperture; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous at its edges but soft at its center”) flirts with purple yet stays tethered to POV’s lyrical bias. One mixed moment: “breathing jagged, shallow, wrong” stacks adjectives but stress justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing pinhole photography with bardo-style storage of love is fresh; the camera’s literal inversion mirrors karmic reversal. Risk taken in near-total interiority pays off via breath mechanics. Not radical, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
