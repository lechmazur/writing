<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation as “patchwork navigator” is concrete through her scavenging, chart-pinning, and final packing of tools; the filial motive surfaces early and drives the midnight vigil. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory, so we feel commitment but not simultaneous opposing urges. The closing decision to leave the station is telegraphed, yet the emotional cost—“raw and necessary homecoming”—lands cleanly. Character earns a solid upper-band mark, capped by limited on-page interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren steps onto the broken road, antenna left looping for strangers—an image that crystallizes her shift from mapper to migrant under a charged poise. Causality holds: every beat (hydraulic failure, call pattern, decoding, moon pacing) funnels to this irrevocable exit. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words; transitions (station → road) are legible; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence—“raw and necessary homecoming”—cementing high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is rendered through signal-station debris, frozen dish, and star-thick sky that “looked like static,” each detail filtered by Maren’s salvage mindset. Copper wire, cat-scream generator, and bronze paw act as micro-settings constraining her build and later choice. Contamination zones and drowned Colmar are sketched rather than toured, keeping economy. Only minor lapse: coast-to-ridge spatial relations remain approximate, preventing the top sliver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the drowned town and mother—tightens as moon calls accumulate; each decoded coordinate removes the option to stay neutral. No external antagonist is needed; tidal signal itself supplies rising pressure. Final exit narrows her world to one south-bound footpath with antenna abandoned, paying visible opportunity cost. Sufficient escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “geography of loss” emerges through salvage charts, reverse migration currents, and Maren’s eventual self-exile, never sermonized. Subtextual echo between bronze paw and missing maternal foot quietly reweights belonging. Final image reframes her prior cartography as merely prelude to personal surrender, offering resonant ambiguity. Avoids tidy moral, though paw symbolism runs close to overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-scavenger (“stitching together routes,” “hand-crank generator screamed like a cat”). Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “called it” for cadence. No dialogue to test, yet narrative idiom stays character-locked. Minor elevation toward lyric closure is earned, not forced.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “sky so thick with stars it looked like static” performs double duty. No synonym loops or scaffolding; sentence variety supports momentum. Occasional poetic compression (“starlight and stubbornness”) risks register drift but stays coherent within Maren’s mythic tone. Clean mechanics and sharp paragraph cuts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-climate-collapse tropes are refreshed by reverse-migration concept and moon-phase phone cartography. Antenna built from a frozen dish plus lion-foot censer fuse tech and talisman in an irreplaceable way. Risky lyric finish pays off, making homecoming feel earned rather than sentimental. Specific detail throughout prevents swap-out test failure.</comment>
