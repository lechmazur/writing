<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulse—ritual self-punishment versus forward-looking release—plays cleanly in-scene via the pocketed drawer-pull and her refusal to delegate the unbinding. The final “forward” command crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost: she absorbs the moral weight Sorin’s question forces on her. Micro-choice beats are present, but the emotional range is narrow (stoic-professional only) and no secondary character applies live pressure, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated imagery (mist, brass pull, moon) intensifies meaning until the closing “wait for the waning” reweights Maren’s stance with lingering cost. Orientation is established by word 60, beats accumulate density, and the final image delivers a resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sorin’s “Where do I go?” reframes the exchange into existential stakes. Closure is clean but not causally irreversible, capping it at 8.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Parapet, mist, and drawer-pull form a micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the charged final image. Sensory selection (wind-tugged coat, crumbling stone) filters through Maren’s hyper-vigilant gaze, supporting the tone. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the simultaneous prisoner approach. Environment does not alter tactics beyond symbolic framing, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren’s moral obligation to deliver two souls safely—tightens when Sorin confronts her with statelessness. Agency is the act of untethering and the imperative “forward,” which forecloses her option to offer personal sanctuary. Pressure is textural, accumulating through mist, moon, and the drawer-pull memory; it forces stance crystallization rather than external reversals. Cost is felt but not materially persistent, keeping it just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the transmutation of guilt into forward motion: the drawer-pull mistake becomes the command “Same as all of us.” Subtext resides in Maren’s tactile unbinding and the moon’s indifferent witness, avoiding moral summation. Final line reweights prior moon imagery into an inevitable waning—an earned, non-literal answer. No thematic drift or explicit thesis statement occurs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Maren’s perceptual filter: “wind pulling at her coat” mirrors internal drag. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful sentence variety that breathes during the fog-covered approach. Dialogue is minimal but natural—Sorin’s two-line query and Maren’s imperative carry subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; voice stays cohesive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, backstory, or beat. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“jaw clenched against the valley”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the single micro-turn is cleanly rendered. Occasional adjectival uplift (“furrowed hush”) is earned by tonal consistency and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The moon-phase exchange protocol and neutral parapet refresh familiar war-trope territory with ritual specificity. The drawer-pull as guilt-engine feels intimate and non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than set-piece twist—but execution remains coherent. Could push further into unexplored moral granularity to reach 8.5+.</comment>
