<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the moment she “discarded assumptions” shows contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice—pocketing the crystal that re-starts the city—carries visible cost in her tears and the gorge wind retuning itself. Competence is balanced by genuine uncertainty until the waveform completes. One hairline slip: “fantasy practicality of someone who repaired miracles” edges toward label-speak, but it’s brief and doesn’t taint the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lunar perigee → corridor opens → shard meets hush → carrier wave completed → city un-paused. Each beat tightens options; the hush arrival is a clear reversal that rewrites the sign-off as a key. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Vireska’s paused state ends, bridges sway to the new frequency, Maren leaves carrying both beginning and end. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop; the swaying bridges and rusted antennae constrain every move and re-tune at closure. The star fragment and tuning console function as micro-setting that literally shapes the final choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s professional gaze—frequency needles, oxidized copper—never tourist catalog. One 9+ gate met: the tower’s physical resources enable and limit the tuning action that resolves the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the corridor or remain in static failure—is signaled on page 1. The midpoint thinning of static is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the “no-signal” option and forces the hush encounter. Cost is legible: the city’s suspended state restarts, Maren shoulders an open-ended transmission she can’t yet name. Under causal lens, escalation is driven entirely by her tuning choices; coincidence complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—every ending is a paused beginning—emerges through the waveform completion and the bridges’ retuning, never stated. The hush-as-signal and star-fragment reprise at closure reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: tears while fingers stay steady. One hairline deduction for the phrase “fantasy practicality,” which momentarily nudges toward thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively Maren’s—technical precision braided with lyric compression (“a shard of hush”). Perceptual signature filters every image through signal theory without jargon overload. Rhythm modulates: long sentences climb the tower, clipped fragments mark the hush arrival. No head-hopping or register drift; the final line’s quiet play crystallizes under her POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences advance goal or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“chandelier no one remembered” sets tone without clutter. One minor scaffold: “every gauge needle trembling like a compass finding north” slightly repeats the already-shown reactivation. No loops or mixed metaphors in the closure beat; the final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystallized broadcast shard + lunar hush synthesis feels fresh and inevitable; no trope catalog offers this exact waveform romance. Risk—using a “pause made of silence” as plot engine—pays off when the gorge itself retunes. Specificity of obsolete network signatures and perigee physics anchors the concept. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the idea is inseparable from Vireska’s rusted towers.</comment>
