<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s exhausted conviction is embodied in the way she handles the shard and covers mirrors; her poetic reflex (“wrote in verse because prose felt inadequate”) is active, not asserted. The final renunciation—letting her own reflection wait—caps her arc with visible cost. Interior contradiction could be sharper in the storm beat; the emotional plateau is slightly too calm for someone watching a species die in light. Still, she is irreducibly particular, not a type.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each mirrored covering and shard projection layers density until the closing image reweights solitude into custodial continuance. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses public vindication, choosing instead “verses held their shape,” a cost legible on-page. One micro-turn suffices at this length. The opening 120-word orientation is taught via baroque stone and defunct revolutionary label—deliberate disorientation that pays off in the final amber wash—so Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<comment>The asteroid’s mineral volutes aren’t backdrop; they determine mirror placement, light behavior, and ultimately the method of reading the shard. Micro-setting of the chamber—mirrors, cradle, storm viewport—constrains every beat. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a geologist-poet’s eye: arabesques, amber braids, golden sorrow. Environment charges the final image when time-light “gilding everything” reprises the gold vein motif with reweighted mourning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the civilization existed—tightens when storm projection offers momentary confirmation; her choice to stay hidden afterwards forecloses academic redemption, a visible price. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens: each draped mirror and projected figure deepens the cost of solitary custodianship. No external antagonist needed; dismissal by “Academic Council” supplies off-stage counterforce. A hairline slip: the beat where she “watched one figure hold something…recognized mourning” tells recognition rather than showing bodily jolt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—creation outlives its creators—emerges through recurring gold/light imagery shifting from ornament to elegy. No explicit thesis; final line’s “amber of what had been” reweights prior mineral glitter into sorrow without moral. Subtext of political failure vs. cosmic stewardship is implied in “defunct in every sense that mattered” beside alien mourners. Complexity survives: her life’s insurgency is not redeemed, only repurposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers at poetic distance yet stays anchored to Maren’s sensory filter: “time-light…braiding together like the hair of some ancient god.” Syntax elongates in calms, fragments under storm surge. No head-hopping; diction (“pareidolia,” “iambic pentameter”) belongs to a self-taught scholar-poet. Voice remains distinct under pressure without artificial compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus causal cue (“uncovered mirrors reflected…corrupted her readings”)—maintaining momentum. Figurative language is dense but patterned: mineral/gold/light triad taught early, paid off in closure. No synonym loops or template cadence; occasional elevated phrasing (“burnished sorrow”) is earned by POV. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid opening to clipped final extinguishing of lamp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of baroque asteroid, visible time-currents, and failed-revolutionary archaeologist is fresh synthesis; removal of any pillar collapses the story. The shard-as-cinema premise sidesteps clichéd alien artifact trope by requiring storm, mirrors, and poetic transcription. Risk in lyric structure pays off: no conventional confrontation yet stakes feel final. Minor proximity echo to “amber waves” trope is transformed through mineral specificity.</comment>
