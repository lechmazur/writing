<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marguerite’s contradictory devotion to her father’s memory while accepting his moral failures is concrete; the nib-as-talisman and logbook-reading are embodied micro-choices. The final decision to publish both diaries and documents is credibly foreshadowed and costs her filial myth. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; “solemn playfulness” is shown, not stated. No relationship crucible on page, hence not quite 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: phone call → ascent → logbook discovery → Crane’s documents → proof-by-contraduction → decision to publish. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she knowingly destroys her mother’s memory and risks the Gazette. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Persistent constraint: the nib pressed to her pulse literalizes the price she’ll keep paying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory above clouds is not postcard scenery; its isolation and stack of logbooks directly supply the evidence that forces her choice. The rosewood nib operates as micro-setting: handled twice, glows in mountain light, finally against her heartbeat—charging the last image. Spatial choreography clean: staircase, console, stone ledge, telescope positions track. Weather/clouds open/close the valley as visual correlative without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—family name vs. paper’s integrity—signalled in paragraph 2. Escalation: each logbook entry tightens moral pressure; Crane’s documents make abstraction visceral. One meaningful tightening: the March 1995 line naming Margaret (her mother) collapses filial loyalty into complicity. Cost legible: she forfeits protective lie and invites public shame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: complicity of privilege, journalism’s collusion, the ethical uses of public shame. Subtext carried in object-handling and silence (Crane “reading her face”). Final image of clouds parting then closing offers resonant non-literal answer: truth momentarily exposed yet future remains obscured, cost accepted. No sermonizing or thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marguerite with selective, character-particular diction: “newsprint heiress,” “vestigial,” “cathedral abandoned by its god.” Syntax mirrors her recursive scrutiny—long sentences for logbook grief, clipped fragments at decision. No head-hop; Crane’s dialogue subtextual, distinct cadence. Perceptual signature consistent: she sees world through investigative metaphor (“proof by contradiction”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety avoids template cadence. High density: “telescopes still pointed at constellations that had long since drifted” does world, theme, irony in one clause. No mixed metaphors; figurative language purposeful rather than ornamental. Minor scaffold: “the orbits of regret” phrase repeated twice—slight loop, not closure-touching. Pronouns, tense, sequencing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar bones—corrupt dynasty, child inheriting sins—are re-animated through observatory-as-confessional and proof-by-contraduction conceit. Rosewood nib as lasting relic of guilt feels particular, not token. Risk taken by making protagonist choose public matricide of memory; complexity embraced without false balance. Could swap place-names with minor edits, hence not 9.</comment>
