<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s motive—restore vanished names—drives every beat; her claustrophobia is embodied (steady countdown, wall-press) and compounds risk. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final “weight of the unremembered” crystallizes endurance with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test, yet micro-choices are mostly forward motion rather than irreversible forks, holding her just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren’s resolve is re-weighted by the golden codex pressed to her spine, ocean whispering—undeniably costly under Accumulative/Textural lens. Single continuous scene, orientation anchored by word 60, slack-tide clock tightens once. No lens ambiguity; causality holds: “found name → entered → retrieved proof → exits with burden.” Minor slip: eighteen-minute deadline is stated, not exploited to foreclose any option on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Facility breathes—salt crust, rust bloom, oscilloscope faces—each detail filtered through Maren’s spelunker eye and time stress. Tide-as-metronome constrains choice, charges final climb. Spatial track clean; no white-room patches. Micro-setting (warped codex, gold flecks) used as tactical object, qualifying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue names from erasure) is signaled in para 2 and intensifies when anomalous signals suggest deeper erasure of meaning. Slack-tide window supplies single deepening that reweights stakes—from family duty to planetary memory. Cost is conceptual (she carries proof the world tried to erase) but not yet viscerally personal; hence stops short of higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—attention as resistance to institutional forgetting—emerges through concrete acts of photographing, whispering names, and the illuminant gold that marks what bureaucracy ignored. Final ocean whisper reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Ambiguity (are signals sentient or projection?) lingers productively. No echo statements; particulars carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Maren’s body and sensory hierarchy; no POV leakage. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, fragments under pressure, mirroring breath. Salt-and-rust lexicon consistent; no register drift. Perceptual signature—steady geologic/tidal imagery—distinct without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tidal cadence; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Figurative layer dense but patterned early (“facility breathed”) and repaid at exit. No scaffold, loops, or contradictory metaphors. Information density high; nearly every line performs double duty. One overripe clause (“altars to an abandoned faith”) nicks top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rescues Cold-War ghost station trope by fusing it with manuscript illumination and unknown oceanic syntax—synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Gold-fleck marginalia as scientific notation re-enchants mundane tech logs. Conceptual risk (slack-tide communication) commits fully, paid off in final image. Not quite paradigm-shifting enough for 9+.</comment>
