<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s fear-driven silence and Jonah’s grief-propelled stalking are credible, contradictory, and embodied; the lens hand-off crystallizes a visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak, but “transparency doing its slow and irreversible work” is slightly performative, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: lens failure → silence → cryptic doodles → eavesdrop → apology → lens transfer, each because/therefore link shrinking options until shared honesty reconfigures the relationship. Closure is a Charged Poise: the warm lens in Jonah’s palm reweights all prior light imagery with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Crystal forecourt’s chimes and wet stone constrain acoustics and timing, forcing whispered honesty; the lens-as-micro-setting refracts literal light and metaphorical truth. Selective sensory detail mirrors emotional glaze without overwriting; one more tactile beat would hit 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will they break the silence—tightens once when Maren voices the apology; honesty forecloses further evasion under the causal lens. Cost is legible: the lens, once failed tool, becomes gift, carrying their mutual vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: honesty as shared light that can both fail and refract. Subtext in doodles and withheld footsteps accumulates; final image of breathing constellation offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Close third adheres to Maren’s quiet registrar precision; perceptual signature filters environment through bureaucratic care (“meticulous handwriting”). Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to the final short, breath-held clause. No head-hopping; minor register lift in “transparency doing its slow and irreversible work” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, varied, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“half-sound, half-silence”). One paraphrase loop—“whispers carried… came to listen… left with nothing but the sound of water and crystal”—slows momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Grief repaired through a projector lens in a singing crystal plaza feels specific and non-obvious; doodles-as-cipher transforms typical reconciliation. Risk resides in near-silent plot, but coherence justifies it.</comment>
