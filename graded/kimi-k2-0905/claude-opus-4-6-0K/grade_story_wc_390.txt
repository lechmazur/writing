<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s embodied, emotionally specific interiority (throat buzzing with dissonance, tears freezing) credibly fuses scientific training with reverence; the micro-choice to “become consonant” with the dying stone cleanly externalizes the “logically emotional” trait and scales the cost to a single throat-raw kneeling beat. Absence of secondary characters keeps status/relationship bullets moot; no unmotivated knowledge leaps or label-speak. Closure renunciation (she sings the fracture closed) is fully earned by prior causal beats and carries palpable somatic cost; could nudge into 9-band if a contradictory impulse were held in scene longer before synch occurs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure delivers an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration: the marina’s cracks seal under a shared third voice, reweighting the premise from “force the stone” to “match the breaking.” Causal lens holds throughout—because Maren hums the dropped frequency, the ice therefore stabilizes; cost is visible in her raw throat and trembling knees. All anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5 and persist; no prop or information teleporting. The key’s identity as tuning fork is planted early enough to pay off cleanly in the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen marina platform, crypt carved into ice shelf, and resonant stone function as micro-setting that directly constrains action: the shifting ice groans dictate the 20-minute countdown and the stone’s sonic properties supply the solution mechanism. Sensory hierarchy honors Maren’s engineer gaze—she notes tuning marks, harmonic decay, frost-slick walls—yet filters through flesh (vibration in teeth/sternum). Environmental detail evolves: cracks propagate, then still as frequencies lock. Spatial choreography is spotless; no anachronisms; the azure coat and iron key re-anchor without name clutter.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—keep ice intact—introduced within first 120 words and tightened by visible countdown; “frequency window closes forever” sets a live clock. Escalation is causal: each micro-tone raise narrows options and increases vocal pain until frequencies lock; the marina’s groans externalize the rising cost. No coincidence required; the reversal (stone drags her upward) is driven by her sustained agency. Could edge 9-band if a secondary loss (e.g., permanent vocal damage) were textually foreshadowed to deepen the final price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of sympathetic resonance as communal healing emerges solely through action: she matches the stone’s fracture in her own body until a shared third voice mends the ice. No explicit thesis stated; final image of “flesh and frequency indistinguishable” offers conceptual repricing that reweights the opening physics premise into spiritual endurance. Ambiguity lingers—will she have to re-sing daily?—without confusion. Particulars (tuning marks on key, throat buzz) keep universality anchored; avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-meets-mystic—“calculate harmonic decay to the decimal” beside “ancient in her marrow.” Syntax lengthens under awe, compresses under timer pressure; no filter-verb clutter. Free indirect bursts (“She was an engineer…”) are clean and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; therefore dialogue bullets ignored. Elision of technical exposition is taught early and paid off by the guided tone-shift mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence lengths mirror breathing cadence; stacked metaphors (“molten gold,” “warm water through flesh”) are purposeful and non-contradictory. High information density—each sentence advances goal, sensation, or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Minor −0.1 because two adjectives (“fleshly and ethereal”) sit adjacent in climax; still under allowance. Closure line lands clean with sonic after-echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Engineer-saving-town via acoustic empathy is fresh synthesis of cli-fi and archaic mysticism; the “key = tuning fork” etymology twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity. No derivative premise drag; avoids trope checklist. Risk in lyric escalatory structure pays off through coherent closure. Could rise into 9+ with one more lived-detail invention (e.g., idiosyncratic lighthouse ritual) to deepen world particularity.</comment>
