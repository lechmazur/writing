<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s pacifist-refusal trait is dramatized through her eleven-year tuning ritual and the climactic choice to open the diary; her micro-choice to “let the town’s hush tune her” embodies contradiction between hunger for silence and fear of maternal silence. Embodied emotion (“felt it in her sternum,” “wept with theatrical sincerity”) keeps interiority concrete. The only bar to 9+ is that the diary-reveal itself happens to her more than it is chosen; she reads, she doesn’t enact a further fork-strike or sonic ritual that seals the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each tuning-fork strike layers a “scaffold of pure tones” that culminates in the diary opening; the final silence re-weighting is a textbook Charged Poise (“warm like a hand almost touching”) with unmistakable conceptual cost—she can never unread the maternal quiet. Transitions are legible within the single continuous scene; the fireworks countdown gives a living clock. No orientation debt; causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The roofless workshop, star-grid, and dust-layered instruments are not backdrop: the open sky literally allows sound to escape and returns the final tuning-fork tone to the stars, charging the closure image. The diary-as-micro-setting is handled twice—locked clasp click, then pressed to chest—each time altering acoustics and emotional posture. Spatial choreography stays clean (fork, bench, chest, sky). Enough specificity to reach 9-band gate, but the brief hospital/child cues elsewhere are slightly less tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the uncatalogued silence”—tightens when the town’s collective hush becomes the final specimen and the diary threatens to overwrite her prior taxonomy. One meaningful deepening: she realizes the silence she hunted was always maternal love, narrowing future options (she must re-write every notebook entry). Cost is legible: the fireworks break her private listening forever. Meets 8+ bar; just shy of 8.8 because the external world (rocket) supplies the burst rather than a further active tuning choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete inversion: the listener discovers she was the one being listened to. Subtext lives in gesture—the untouched hand in the dark—never in thesis statements. Final image reweights every earlier silence entry without moralizing. Complexity intact: maternal silence is both failure and fierce devotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter: “constellations pulsed,” “static, the universe adjusting its antenna.” Lyric syntax mirrors her tuning ear—long vowel-rich sentences that literally slow breath. No head-hopping; diction stays within her instrument lexicon. Tiny shift to theatrical sincerity at the end is earned by prior “grandly, generously” self-tag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm controlled: sentence length modulates with fork decays. High density—“pressed cotton, faintly copper-tasting” does three jobs (texture, taste, medical sterility). One mixed metaphor risk—“crystallized final moment where options and stakes are made legible” (evaluator language, not story) is external, but no such slippers occur inside the prose itself. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; fireworks line varies cadence cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustics-as-emotional-forensics meets maternal silence; not a trope parade. Risk in basing climax on reading handwritten pages pays off because the diary content is delivered as sensory fragments, not exposition. Specificity of “dandelions like dignitaries” makes the image unforgettable. Could push 9+ with a slightly less expected final beat than weeping under fireworks—already a lyric standby—but transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
