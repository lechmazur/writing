<grade>8.1</grade>  
<comment>Maren’s contradiction—erasing memories while hunting the origin of pain—is vivid and embodied; the spiral notation scene crystallizes her obsession. Yet her single micro-choice (logging the void) is cumulative, not causal, so the 9-band “earned cost” test is only half-met. No relationship crucible is on-page, so secondary-pressure bullets are waived. Interiority is specific, but the final poise is more observed than paid for in immediate flesh.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>  
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the last image of Maren “waiting, stylus ready” reweights the premise—each erasure simultaneously funds her map and deepens her own void. The accumulative/textural lens holds: every absence logged is a stitch in the sail that keeps the library aloft. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered. Causality is present but operates at the level of pattern rather than event, satisfying the lens without a decisive physical act.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>  
<comment>The glass orchard, bottled moonlight, and obsidian tablets are not backdrop—they constrain every move: the floating library demands erasure as parole, the moonlight fills the incised spiral, the tablets literally carve identity. Micro-setting (the spiral groove) charges the final image. Sensory economy is flawless; no filler lines. Weather and spatial anchors remain stable within the single chamber.</comment>  

<question>4</question>  
<grade>8.2</grade>  
<comment>Dominant stake—map the origin of pain via absence—is signaled early and tightens through each logged lacuna; the spiral entry marks a cadence shift that raises conceptual cost. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the accumulating map itself. Agency is intellectual (continue logging) rather than physical, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: every tablet she sells widens her own unknown wound.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>  
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that forgetting is the only remaining way to remember the first wound. Subtext lives in gesture—Maren touching her own wiped wrist while filling another’s void. The final spiral glowing with moonlight reweights the entire inventory: origin is not a seed but a swirling absence. No moral is stated; resonance is purely imagistic and undeniable.</comment>  

<question>6</question>  
<grade>8.8</grade>  
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is exact—“dust did not exist here above the clouds,” “lacuna seven syllables wide.” Syntax modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for action. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Compression like “glimmering parole” is taught by context and paid off in the wrist-glow.</comment>  

<question>7</question>  
<grade>9.1</grade>  
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, atmosphere, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“void with motion” marries spiral and cloud. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines bookend the obsession with mirrored light/void imagery.</comment>  

<question>8</question>  
<grade>9.3</grade>  
<comment>The premise—erasure-as-cartography to locate narrative birth—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the glowing spiral. No genre templates or famous echoes. Conceptual integrity is absolute: the floating library, parole bracelet, and absence-logging form an inseparable system.</comment>
