<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her grief over lost astronomy and her tactile obsession with refracted light feel lived-in. The micro-choice to polish each shard and test its placement dramatizes her hierarchy of values; the final extinguishing of the lantern is a credible renunciation that costs her the last vestige of professional identity. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, however; the conflict is largely nostalgic rather than active, so the arc is gentle, not galvanic. Still, the Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: she trades telescopic distance for intimate, ground-level constellations.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern dies and the grotto’s self-lit “constellations” bloom—an undeniable reconfiguration of her life’s mission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each placed shard tightens the visual pattern until the final extinguishing flips the value of light itself. Causality is internal but coherent—because she polishes and arranges, the grotto can “breathe back” starlight. The only slack is the late arrival of the visitor announcement; it doesn’t alter tactics and thus feels tacked-on rather than causal.</comment>

<comment>The grotto is never a postcard; its wet ribs, calcite shelves, and breathing mist actively constrain how light can travel and where Maren can stand. The sea-glass fragments evolve from cloudy refuse to lenses, a micro-setting that dictates the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless—lantern angle, shelf height, and mist density are tracked beat by beat. The final image of a “captured piece of sky” inside stone is irreplicable without this exact environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and deepens through tactile beats; each polished shard is a micro-investment whose payoff is the blue arc in mist. Escalation is incremental, not decisive: the pressure is aesthetic rather than existential, so the cost feels gentle (loss of professional telescope light) rather than punishing. The final tightening is the lantern-off moment, but it reweights meaning more than it forecloses options. A sharper external risk (will visitors ruin, mock, or steal the light?) would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the universe’s grandeur can be re-scaled to fist-sized glass and still retain awe. No character lectures us; the insight arrives via the final image of “memory itself made visible.” The refusal to moralize keeps the resonance raw—light as gift rather than possession. Counter-readings linger: is this consolation or retreat? The ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is stellar: Maren notices like an ex-astronomer—angles, periodicity, “exquisite time.” Syntax lengthens and softens under the grotto’s humidity, then tightens into lapidary precision when she polishes. No filter-verb clutter; light “blooms,” mist “holds,” glass “throws”—verbs are kinetic yet precise. The lyric compression in “zephyr of illumination” is earned because the pattern of breath and refraction has been taught beat by beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Every sentence pulls double duty: polishing motion recalls telescope tracking, salt residue evokes stellar dust. Rhythm breathes with the grotto—long exhalations for mist, staccato taps for grit. No mixed metaphors; the rib-cage metaphor is extended, not swapped. The only micro-loop is “light does not need to burn to be shared” echoing the prompt line; it feels intentional rather than scaffold, but still keeps the piece a hair below flawless.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis of closed observatory + sea-glass constellations is genuinely fresh; the premise would collapse if transplanted to another backdrop. The inversion—stars underground—re-prices what “celestial” means without gimmickry. Risk is taken: a quiet, contemplative arc in under 800 words, yet the final lantern-off moment lands with photographic afterglow. The concept commits fully; no late rule changes or safety hedging.</comment>
