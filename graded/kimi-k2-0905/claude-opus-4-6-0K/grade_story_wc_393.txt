<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elda’s knuckle-bite, micro-choice to wind the spring, and the cost of tomorrow’s visit crystallize her arc with felt cost; Marcus remains off-stage, so his motives are relayed, not embodied—within scope but short of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lullaby emerges, Elda’s whispered “tomorrow” locks her into a path with undeniable emotional cost; causal lens holds from first broken spring to final golden blaze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shop’s ticking chorus and the storm-light slices actively mute/ignite the moment; the clockwork heart itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the repair choice and charges the final image—gate satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single tightening—Elda’s decision to repair—forecloses the option of refusal; cost is legible but scaled to a quiet story; no rising external antagonism beyond internal dread, so escalation stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of mediated forgiveness emerges organically through the mechanical heart’s song; the lullaby reprises as non-verbal apology, reweighting prior guilt without moralizing—resonant, oblique, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Father Tomás, perceptual signature filtered through clerical patience and chiaroscuro light; subtle free-indirect traces of Elda’s diction (“you’re the chaplain”) keep voice distinct without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, symbolic work; metaphor trains never clash; final golden blaze is precisely seeded by storm-light motif—clean, propulsive, musical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Music-box-as-confessional is fresh; chaplain-as-courier rather than savior reframes clerical role; storm-light as emotional barometer reweights cliché; synthesis feels particular, though premise edges close to “gift that absolves” trope.</comment>
