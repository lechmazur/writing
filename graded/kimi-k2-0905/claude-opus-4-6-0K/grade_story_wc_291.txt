<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s prosopagnosia and compensatory “manual empathy” are vivid, embodied, and drive every charcoal stroke; the forty-four-day ritual crystallizes into a credible renunciation that costs her the ability to ever “recognise” her own finished love. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-help speak—and the final weeping is earned by accrued micro-choices. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, capping the high band. Still, the arc of building love without facial memory is individuated and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the completed portrait re-activates a cold case, making “indifference impossible,” with the quarry’s mist as visible social cost. Causal chain holds—each mirrored charcoal deduction leads inexorably to the precinct revisit—and the ribbon fragment’s tremor signals the decisive change on the page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (face-blindness) shapes every tactic and the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry walls, pooled mist, and the frayed violet ribbon function as micro-setting that literally constrains Maren’s process: the granite echo swallows sound, forcing her inward, and the water’s edge is the only place the portrait can be “witnessed.” Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she notices bone angles, not faces. The ribbon’s final tremor recharges the opening image, meeting the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “still green water” is the only non-POV color cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy for the forgotten dead—tightens once when the portrait coheres and she weeps, foreclosing the option to remain merely methodical. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each mirrored stroke increases density until the cadence shift (“she realized she was weeping”) reweights cost. No external antagonist is needed; the internal blindness vs. empathy conflict is sufficient and visibly priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: attention itself is love, and justice is a by-product of sustained, unrecognisable care. The ribbon’s reprise and the quarry’s faceless mist reconfigure the stakes in the final image—an unspoken answer to how the forgotten can be reclaimed. No moralizing, only charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—geometric, shadow-obsessed, synaesthetic (“mist pooled like milk in a stone bowl”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long cadences for ritual, staccato deductions for structure. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her taciturn, spatial lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causality—without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop (“the evidence had disappeared, and with it, the department’s will to continue”) costs the final 0.1. Otherwise, propulsion is flawless and the closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portraitist who draws the dead by mirroring absence is a fresh synthesis; the quarry-as-studio and ribbon-as-relic transform familiar noir tropes into lyric ritual. Risk—relying on pure accumulative texture rather than plot twists—pays off because the final portrait reweights the entire premise. No echo of famous scenes; specificity feels inevitable.</comment>
