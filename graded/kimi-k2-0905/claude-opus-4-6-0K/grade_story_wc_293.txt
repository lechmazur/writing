<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vanishing-hitchhiker trigger is accepted as situational inciting pressure; Cora’s cataloguing response keeps her agency alive under shock. Interiority is concrete—“calcified likeite in a pipe” shows embodied contradiction—but emotional progression leans therapeutic (“sculpt possibility from ashes”) rather than raw. Micro-choice to drive toward the coordinates is clean, but no persistent flaw or cost is attached to the decision on the page, so the arc flirts with safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the engine turns over and the fiddle case vibrates, crystallizing the new path with felt opportunity cost against the word “never.” Causality is situational—pressure comes from the impossible vanish and the glass shard, not because/therefore chains—acceptable under the lens declared. Orientation is swift: who, where, when anchored by mile 120. One minor causality wobble: GPS coordinates scratched into fragile collodion would flake away with handling, yet the text treats them as legible without remark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—warm vinyl, ether-silver, struck-match sky—filters through Cora’s practiced attention. The pullout’s smoke-blue layers double her internal haze, integrating landscape with state. The scaffold-wrapped bridge is only a photograph, never entered, so setting constrains choice conceptually rather than physically; the final image is the truck cab, not the gorge, capping intensity just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the frozen vow “never again”; the glass shard forces a single tightening—will she re-enter the music?—and the decision to drive reopens the path with visible social/emotional risk. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under situational lens; no reversal but the deepening is sufficient for 750 words. Cost is implicit in the resurrected self-image; a more palpable forfeiture (fuel money, time, public exposure) would push 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented self-amnesty emerges through glass, scaffold veil, and the “photograph still developing” line—never sermonized. Pixel metaphor risks jargon but is localized and repaid by the final “shard you assemble yourself.” Ending image of luminous disbelief offers non-literal reconfiguration without moral tag; complexity holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent psychic distance; diction—“weathered cedar,” “snaps and flutters”—carries Cora’s sensorial bias. Rhythm breathes: longer reflective sentences contract into “She catalogued. She catalogued.” No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture; the lyric lift avoids purple through specificity. Filter verbs minimal; one POV slip: “someone had painted symbols” infers knowledge she can’t verify from a torn photo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density, with purposeful metaphor clusters that reweight rather than overwrite. No loops, no scaffold; only one mixed image—“calcified likeite in a pipe” is technically backwards (lime, not likeite) but reads as idiosyncratic coinage rather than error. Opening line anchors stakes; closing line recharges the fiddle motif. Occasional elevated register (“pixelated amnesty”) momentarily lifts above Cora’s vernacular yet fits the conceptual turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing vanishing-hitchhiker folklore with wet-plate photography and scaffold cartography feels fresh; the pixel/amnesty concept literalizes emotional restoration without tech gimmickry. Transformation test fails—core arc is “catastrophe → artifact → return”—but specific occupational detail (bridge-song fiddler) and the synesthetic glass shard make the remix memorable. Risk is moderate; payoff clean.</comment>
