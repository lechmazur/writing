<comment>Maren’s protective drive and curiosity are clear, but interior contradiction is told (“She hadn’t meant to be heroic”) rather than enacted; the moment she breaks protocol to speak into the channel is credible yet the embodied cost (shaking hands) feels gestural. No opposing impulse is dramatized in scene, so the choice reads as single-note instinct rather than clashing values. Still, the micro-choice to steady the child’s pulse with her own heartbeat is specific and stakes her body, earning modest lift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: mist → hearing-aid pickup → double pulse → rule breach → child saved. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the living heartbeat displaces the dead signal, leaving Maren with tremors that register price. Orientation is swift; conservatory, twilight, and job are anchored by word 80. One minor causality fuzz: the photograph is grabbed and repinned without showing what new knowledge it provides; hence not quite 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Glass-roofed conservatory, weeping condensation, and analog hearing-aid static interleave with action; the fog functions as both ceiling and congregation, pressing spatial and moral pressure. The photograph micro-object is handled twice but never yields new visual intel, so it constrains no tactical shift. Still, the moist green hush pervades every beat and the final image of breath on glass recharges the mist motif, meeting the 9- gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—shield a child from emotional contagion—is signaled within 200 words and tightens when the second pulse appears. Agency manifests as the forbidden vocal intervention; success costs her calm (hands shake), foreclosing future complacency. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under causal lens; no additional reversals needed. Cost is visible but brief, keeping it just below the 8.5 band that would require a persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges through action: curiosity-driven protocol breach saves a stranger, not self-conscious valor. Final image of the hearing-aid set down “like something sacred” crystallizes the idea that empathy is a fragile instrument. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the quiet contrast between bureaucratic title and lived risk. Slight deduction for the administrative label “incidental heroism” appearing in narration near end, half-step toward echo.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s sensory filter: bruised hour, warm distortion, sub-whispers. Syntax lengthens under tension then fractures into short clauses during the rescue, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through perceptual signature and rhythmic control. One register wobble: “emotional contagion” reads diagnostic amid otherwise imagistic diction, but it occurs early and is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; sentences rarely repeat structure. Figurative language is selective—fog like congregation, pulse like bird—each image advances stakes. No mixed metaphors or filler stacks. Minor scaffold: “She hadn’t meant to be heroic” is abstract summary immediately after the beat; trimming would heighten immediacy. Otherwise clean, read-aloud rhythm intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” via 1980s hearing-aid is a fresh speculative twist that grows organically from analog frequency logic rather than gimmick. Emotional core—protecting kids from predatory nostalgia—reverses usual ghost-story appetite. Risk is quiet: breaking silence to offer living heartbeat, not weapon or spell. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious; piece would collapse with digital tech or generic medium. Edge short of 9 only because foster-home detail is stock adjacent.</comment>
