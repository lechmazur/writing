<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Miriam’s contradictory obedience-to-truth impulse is dramatized in the tunnel through tactile note-taking and palm-on-wall; the final choice to carbon-copy the report is earned by the Underground-Railroad memory graft and costs her the protection of silence. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (“felt memories that were not her own...through her bones”). Competence and flaw are balanced: she knows evidence rules yet has complied for years, so the turnaround feels weighted. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV interior conflict meets the 9- gate for contradictory impulses in scene.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the unredacted report sent to two masters irrevocably forecloses her former complicity and carries the visible cost of career peril. Causal chain holds: lantern witness → entangled memories → report choice; each because/therefore step is on page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never break. No lens ambiguity; causality drives every beat to the final ladder climb.

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel’s rust-sweet groundwater, sparking cable, and star-punched lantern are filtered through Miriam’s investigatory gaze; each detail either pressures choice (missing guard, illegible sign) or charges the final image (lantern left warm to “go on witnessing”). Subtle mirroring: city drinking rain parallels Miriam drinking buried truth. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment constrains the final act—she photographs the sign by lantern/flash clash—meeting the 9+ gate.

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break free from complicity—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens exactly once when she decides irreversible dual submission of the report, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; each observed hazard raises the cost of silence. No reversal, but the single meaningful tightening satisfies length default. Visible price (career safety) is legible in the imagined phone call with Hargrove.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited complicity emerges inductively from frayed cable / ignored complaints braided with Underground-Railroad residue; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext operates in lantern left “not as a shrine but as a witness” and in rain soaking pavement after drought—images reweight complicity without moralizing. Final image of “unbearable and necessary openness” offers resonant CR. Avoids tidy binaries; authority guilt and historic oppression stay entangled.

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“mineral sweetness of fresh groundwater”) is investigator-specific, sensory-anchored. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences early, clipped report listing mid-scene, open vowel cadence at ascent. No dialogue on page, so voice contamination absent. Diction stays within Miriam’s plausible lexicon; no corporate register drift.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract under flashlight sweep and lengthen during memory bleed. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory data, backstory cue, and foreshadowing (“drought had widened”). Metaphors are coherent (train vibration “through her bones”) and limited; no mixed clusters in peak beats. Minor paraphrase risk in “softening reports...cost her something” but does not recur; closure sentence crystalline.

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusion of preventable-death probe with Underground-Railroad lantern and entangled memories is fresh synthesis; stakes feel specific to Fulton-Street tunnel rather than generic whistle-blower arc. Historical graft rewards re-reading yet does not hijack Miriam’s agency. Transformation test fails if moved to another city—tunnel’s documented way-point status is essential. Risk is present but controlled; no gimmickry.
