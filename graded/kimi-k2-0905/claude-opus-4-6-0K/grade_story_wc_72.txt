<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s refusal to simplify is credibly seeded by the grandmother’s earlier inability to act, and the final choice carries the cost of forever bearing unresolvable guilt; yet her interiority occasionally drifts into thematic self-explanation (“I don’t want to simplify it”) that flattens embodied contradiction at the crucial beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stained light reframes both garden and lineage, cost is palpable; the Causal lens (revelation therefore stance shift) holds cleanly, though the grandmother’s Senate origin is revealed late, slightly diluting fore-causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden coral and silted lamp-light constrain movement and supply the final refractive image; specificity is disciplined to what Maren’s goal-directed gaze needs, charging the closing glow without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single tightening beat—take or leave ampoule—narrows options under coherent pressure; the price of permanent moral ambiguity is visible, though escalation is intellectual rather than visceral, fitting Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of un-simplifiable complicity emerges through particular generational choices, not statement; the violet scatter across stone reweights prior images, delivering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—architectural precision mixed with aqueous softness—remains consistent; telepathy is taught early and paid off, no filter-verb clutter, rhythm modulates with revelation breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—every sentence advances image or knowledge; one paraphrase loop (“cascading revelations…each one restructured…”)轻度削弱尾段锋利感, otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Drowned garden performing forgotten beauty, architect-mind in basalt, and confession-as-light feels inevitable yet unforeseen; synthesis is specific to this voice, not modular swap.</comment>
