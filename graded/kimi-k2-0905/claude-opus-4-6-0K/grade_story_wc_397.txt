<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—tumor shimmer, coin-over-well grip—and her micro-choice to ignore the clinic call grows believably from tactile labor and the parasol-tip trigger. The contradiction between seeking death and persisting in salvage work stays embodied, not declared. Yet the men remain functional silhouettes, so relationship/status crucible is absent, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forgoes the scheduled death with visible cost—the missed call, the brass spoke clicking like a ticking option now refused. Accumulative lens holds: each debris haul layers density until the parasol-tip re-weights “endings” from abstract silence to plural, bearable sounds. Causality is lyric-not-linear, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but tool: splintered docks, black water, and groaning piers constrain every reach and footstep. Frost on lace and the brass shadow on ice charge the final image that crystallizes her stance. Cold is rendered through breath-second skeletons and epoxy flash-freeze—selective, urgent, POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when salvage labor replaces clinical countdown. One meaningful deepening: the parasol-tip reframes death from singular clinic room to plural environmental cadences, foreclosing the original path without external rescue. Cost is palpable in the ignored call and the click of brass against button as she walks back to indefinite labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from lace relic vs. tumor: both fragile filigree, yet one survives by surrender to ice, the other by human schedule. Final image reweights “endings” from private euphemism to shared, ongoing creaks—resonant without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: tomorrow she may still die, but now the choice is lived, not booked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—shimmer halos, coin-grip reality, windborne hymns. Syntax lengthens in calms, fractures in chill; no head-hop. Brass-click diction (“spoke against coat button”) is hers alone, cementing voice-prose fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “cold became a second skeleton” compresses physiology and metaphor in four words. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to trawling staccato. Only micro-slip: “modern sculpture” feels editorial beside the otherwise pristine Arctic idiom, but it never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Euthanasia tourist meets disaster-relief dock without cliché; the parasol-tip twist converts heritage kitsch into ontological pivot. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-twist, satisfying the freshness test.</comment>
