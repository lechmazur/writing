<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to self while hosting another—drives every micro-choice from sneaking to drumming; the final Earned Stasis (“every breath belonged to her”) costs Davi’s presence and is fully earned by the causal chain of night-time drumming that fuses then releases him. No stock phrasing; body and memory collide in specific, embodied beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon dissolves but warmth remains, severing the intrusive loop at visible cost (“a drummer finally set down his sticks”). Causal lens holds—because she drums, therefore the frequencies release him—tightened once through the garden duet; no orientation debt; garden spatial anchors drop by line 6. One minor ellipsis: we never see how she first learned the garden responds to rhythm, but the payoff is already weighted enough.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystallized frequencies, low stalactites, honey-warm water—three selective, POV-filtered strokes—constrain tactics: only tapping them lets Mira weaponize sound to unpick entanglement. Final image of warmth “in her bones” recycles the lagoon’s gold into body-as-setting, meeting the 9+ gate. One micro-slip: “facility ceiling” is generic amid bespoke acoustics, but it never re-appears at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim self from Davi’s memories—tightens when drumming shifts from habit to deliberate exorcism; the reversal (“the memories settled… tenants, no longer intruders”) costs the dream-lagoon itself, price paid on-page. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no outside coincidence; one meaningful deepening suffices at 750 words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of porous identity emerges through sonic metaphor and fusion-custody of memory; no overt thesis. Final reweighting—shared dream becomes hers alone—lands via image, not assertion, inviting counter-readings about mourning and creative appropriation. Complexity is embraced: the dead drummer is both savior and colonizer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains Mira’s percussive perceptual signature—cadences mimic sticks on skin, attention gravitates to vibration, silence “between midnight and whatever comes after.” No head-hop; diction stays within her plausible lexicon even under lyric lift; filter verbs are scarce and voice-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density—almost every sentence twins sensory data with emotional stakes; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (sound = gold = water = body). One mixed cluster: “auroral sorrow… beauty that exists only because it is breaking” edges toward purple but is saved by its tie to closure timbre. No loops, no scaffold, rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Neural grafting and acoustic botanic tech feel fresh because they serve a non-obvious emotional need: giving the dead a place to rest inside the living. The lagoon-dream is re-synthesized through sound crystals—specific, un-stealable image; risk in lyric escalation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
