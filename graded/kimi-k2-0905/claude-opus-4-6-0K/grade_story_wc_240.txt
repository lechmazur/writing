<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to control while longing to let go—are embodied in every beat: she kneels into the mesh instead of recoiling, deletes “compromised” for “never the point.” The spatial gift is more than label; it enables the final, wordless surrender. Cost is legible in the tremoring hand and the deleted line—her professional armor cracked open.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each fungal signal passes through a barrier → Maren re-perceives her own walls → final edit forecloses the old professional stance. The Orient-test waiver applies; disorientation serves closure. Closure image (“light pass through her… without asking permission”) costs her entire prior identity with a single, irretrievable shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground farm is not backdrop; its humidity curtain and mesh physically constrain the final choice—she can feel the filaments only because the screen is permeable. Blue-green pulses mirror and then reweight her interior state. Removing the farm collapses the stakes and the tactile closure; the setting charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep armoring or let permeability in?—tightens once: laser pointer triggers fungal answer → she kneels into the mesh → deletes the old report, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible in the shaking hand and the professional language she abandons. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of permeability-as-connection emerges from fungal signals, barrier tests, and the final self-edit; no character sermonizes. The closing image reweights every prior wall—her marriage, her job—without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: is surrender strength or dissolution? The story refuses to choose, letting the reader feel the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV stays tight third; diction (“felt weather changes in old fractures,” “quiet wildfire”) is unmistakably Maren’s perceptual signature. Compression (“She did not pull away”) amplifies pressure without losing clarity. No head-hop; psychic distance narrows to skin-level at climax, matching the shift from observation to permeability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job, memory, and fungal cue. Rhythm accelerates into the single-line paragraph “She did not pull away,” then exhales into the birdsong coda. Figurative language stays coherent—mushroom light as “star too close to touch” charges the final surrender without mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing intrusion-detection tech with fungal biocomputing yields a fresh conceptual lens on heartbreak; nowhere else could this plot fit. The “familiar strangers” motif is inverted—Maren recognizes her own estranged self, not Tessa. Risk in lyric quietude pays off: the ending lands harder than a shouted breakup scene.</comment>
