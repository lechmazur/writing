<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vael’s contradictory impulses—yearning to leave yet re-weaving her prison—are rendered in embodied, image-rich micro-choices (trimming the wick, turning the guilt-hand). Her final Earned Stasis, “she had long ago woven it into the pattern,” carries explicit cost under the Accumulative lens and is fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early (starlight + lamp = layered hush) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry pulsing with redistributed weight reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props or causal breaks; closure holds under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight triangulate to constrain every orientation decision; the lamp’s tongue-width flame literally enables the fractal-reading angle that lets Vael work burdens. Final image of layered silence recharged by prior “shingled hush” satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent mountain-splitting calcification—tightens once when dawn threatens irreversible hardening; Vael’s agency (threading each burden) visibly forecloses her own exit, paying the price under Accumulative escalation. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges recursively: freedom-as-burden is woven, not stated. Final image reweights premise without moral—her “boundary-lessly trapped” stance crystallizes as conceptual cost. No echoic thesis; resonance arises from lamp-governed particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person adheres to Vael’s fractal perception: syntax layers sub-clauses like spirals, diction stays metallurgical and textile-specific. Rhythm breathes with whalebone reverie, then tightens when the wick is trimmed—taught pattern paid off at closure. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphor vectors stay coherent (copper ribbons, whalebone ribs). High density—“starlight bent into copper-colored ribbons that swam”—advances both atmosphere and plot. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) do not cluster; zero loops or mixed vehicles in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fractal-weaving grief into starlit bronze is a fresh synthesis; nowhere else could this renunciation occur. Risk-taking compression (“shingled hush”) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity absolute—no retreat into generic mountain shrine.</comment>
