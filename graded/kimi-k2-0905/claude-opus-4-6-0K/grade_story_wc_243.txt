<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s solitary ritual and the locket moment embody contradictory devotion and abandonment; the final offer to “start with what you remember” crystallizes her hierarchy of values at visible cost. Elise’s off-stage choice to leave and on-stage return supply credible pressure, but her interiority is only implied, capping depth. The earned stasis—covenant regrown, not restored—lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ink-steeped ledger and reopened pen physically foreclose the option of forgetting; cost is legible in the phrase “write down the world before it forgot itself.” Causal lens holds throughout—each husk, letter, and footstep because/therefore advances the possibility of regeneration. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The copper basin, clematis-wrapped pilings, and umber ink constrain every micro-choice; the jetty’s between-state geography mirrors Maren’s suspended grief. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—salt smell, darkening liquid, scallop-edged photo—guiding the final collaborative act. Environment is not backdrop but medium; without it the covenant could not be resteeped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve small moments—tightens when the letter arrives: Elise’s return forces Maren to risk reopening the record and herself. One meaningful deepening: “haunted euphoria” crystallizes the cost of restarting. Agency sits with Maren offering the pen; option to refuse is foreclosed by eleven years of ink already poured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the slow stain of husks: memory as stubborn vegetal growth, not nostalgic artifact. Subtext in Elise’s rougher voice and the shared silence while writing implies repentance without sermon. Final image reweights “small moments” as the only durable history—earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Maren’s perceptual signature—ink darkness equals emotional palette; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and softens under grief, then tightens at Elise’s arrival, mirroring suspense. Dialogue is minimal but voice-distinct: Elise’s rasp versus Maren’s archival precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from liquid cumulative clauses to clipped final exchange; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained to ink/wine/flora continuum, avoiding mixed metaphors. Every paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge; no filler between “footsteps on the planks” and the pen offer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Walnut-ink archivist” and regenerative covenant feel freshly sutured to coastal decay; trope of returning lover is subverted by collaborative re-inscription rather than reunion kiss. Risk in slow lyric accumulation pays off when the ledger—not the relationship—becomes the love object. Specificity of tannin timing and scallop-edged photo prevents generic swap-out.</comment>
