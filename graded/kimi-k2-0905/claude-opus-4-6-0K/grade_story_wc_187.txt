<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sabel’s interiority is textured—her “pre-emptive nostalgia” is embodied in the way she tracks shadow-length like a pulse—but the moment of conjecture itself is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice, so the final pivot feels slightly pre-announced rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ledger page becomes a Decisive Change that reweights her role from neutral scribe to active author; the cost—she is now complicit in the identity she archives—is legible in the final crackle of ink. Accumulative lens holds: each murmur-layer thickens until she chooses to sculpt, not merely transcribe.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Crystal forecourt and solidified fog are not backdrop but instruments: the tiles trap voices she must later betray, the fog presses physically on the walls the way archive-pressure presses on her. Micro-setting wins—quill, ledger, shadow-angle—each constrains timing and tactic, charging the final inscription with site-specific inevitability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stake (“archive’s identity vs her integrity”) is signaled early and tightens when she admits selection = creation; the single meaningful turn is her decision to conjecture openly, foreclosing the safe path of neutral transcription. Cost is visible: she seals her complicity in ink before storm-swallow, no reset possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between faithful recording and inevitable authoring; no character lectures us—meaning accrues through the audible layering of whispers and the shadow-clock that counts down her tenure. Final image reconfigures the archive as living palimpsest rather than static record, resonance achieved without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice owns a consistent lyric tilt—syntax stretches like storm-light without breaking clarity; perceptual signature is sharp (“bruised violet glow,” “cold mineral weight”). No dialogue, so no convergence risk; free-indirect stays anchored to Sabel’s mineral attentiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: rhythmic variation mirrors the rising hush, no scaffold loops, metaphors stay physical (“voices braided into a single trembling note”). One hairline slip—“particular ache she had come to recognize”—leans slightly diagnostic, but it’s brief and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological archive where fog solidifies and voices are quarried like ore; archivist as reluctant identity-sculptor reframes memory-work as artistic betrayal. Risk—lyric accumulation over plot—pays off because the final inscription retroactively charges every prior whisper with new culpability.</comment>
