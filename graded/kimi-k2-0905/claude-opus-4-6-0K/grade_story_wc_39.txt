<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pell’s contradiction—madness versus archivist—drives every micro-choice (sealing the jar, writing on the gas bill). The moment he “understood what it was playing” fuses memory to mission, giving credible interior pressure. No external status clash is on-stage, but the solo portrait is specific, embodied, and stakes a generational debt with visible cost in the final hush.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn fusion of sea-wind and broken lullaby reweights the premise, sealing an audible future the reader senses even if invisible. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each jar, the corroded comb, the new label tighten the archive’s burden. Orientation is clean by line 4; no prop or rule breaks occur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The salt-warped loft, sand-pierced floorboards, and corroded music-box teeth act as micro-setting that literally filters sound and choice. Pell positions the box “beside” the open jar on the sill—environment constrains acoustics and seals the payoff. Sensory selection is POV-slanted toward rust, wind, and ink, never touristic. The final image could not occur without this acoustic shell.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save vanishing sounds—tightens once: the ruined lullaby forces Pell to attempt the dawn “sweetening.” That single escalation is meaningful and irrevocable; the sealed jar forecloses redoing the take. Cost is the audible gaps he must live with, now frozen in wax. No antagonist needed; pressure is entropic loss made personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of inter-generational translation emerges from the corroded lullaby, the eleven prior jars, and the new label “For Whoever Comes After.” Subtext resides in the silence inside glass—absence as inheritance. No moral is stated; resonance is the felt hush after sealing. The motif shift from “grief” to “dawn” reweights the archive toward hope without tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Pell’s sensory filter: “ink-stained down to the knuckle,” “particular silence after a wave withdrew.” Syntax is lyric yet controlled, with purposeful repetition (“slow burial… slow rescue”) that mirrors dunes vs. poet. No head-hop or register drift. Voice differentiates itself from tourist-boardwalk diction through scrounged receipts and bread crusts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Every sentence layers job: sensory, metaphoric, forward. No loops, no filler; “the dunes shifted in their sleep” opens with charged personification that teaches texture. Metaphors stay physical—“chewed the staircase banister into lace”—and do not crowd high-pressure beat. Final line cadence shortens to match sealing click, showing ear control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “sound-archive in jars” core is fresh yet inevitable; it literalizes salvage anthropology without steampunk garnish. Risk lies in conceit that could feel gimmicky, but grounding via the real, broken lullaby and single-scene jar creation keeps it human. Transformation test fails if Pell is swapped with generic collector—his inked knuckles and grandma song are particular. Stakes feel non-obvious: acoustic extinction, not treasure.</comment>
