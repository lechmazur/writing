<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—yearning for closeness while practicing guarded detachment—remains vivid in her tactile reading of oak and silent decoding of weather logs; the final palm-to-grain moment crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is the forever-untaken step toward him. Motivation is consistent and scaled to length; micro-choices (opening the logbook, tracing grain, pressing palm) track her feather persistence without slipping into diagnostic self-talk. No second character on page, so relationship dynamics waived; occupation (corn-maze legacy) seeds thematic pressure rather than operational detail and is allowed at this length. The only trace short of 9 is a thin dramatization of the “butterfly-effect” quarrel—summarized, not scened—so the emotional rupture is inferred more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the CAVOK entry re-weights every prior weather code into a quiet avowal of distant vigilance, and the palm-on-oak beat makes the cost of irreversible distance undeniable—an earned stasis under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught, not defaulted: “terrace drifted” opens with deliberate dislocation that pays off in the spectral refraction of the final image. Causality is associative—logbook → memory → grain-reading → insight—but the pattern is foreshadowed and coherent; no prop or knowledge teleport. The −0.1 keeps it below 9.5 because the triggering quarrel remains off-page, a slight softening of the causal keel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its moving spectra literally fracture sight, enforcing the difficulty of true perception and mirroring the daughter–father refraction; the oak table’s tight grain becomes the tactile anchor that counters the floating instability. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Maren’s professional eye—weather codes, wood rings, refracted light—delivering economy and specificity. Spatial choreography is seamless; no floating props. The only minor slip is “light split and reformed” repeated with near-paraphrase inside two sentences, a microscopic echo that nicks the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: comprehending/accepting paternal distance; pressure escalates through pattern accumulation—each weather code adds retrospective weight until CAVOK forces a final recalibration of meaning. Cost is conceptual but legible: the realization that their separation is permanent and architected. No causal antagonist is required under Accumulative lens; escalation arises from density, not reversal. Held off 8.8 because the middle lacks a visible tactical trade-off; the conflict stays interior and the price, while felt, is not dramatized through forfeited action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the architecture of distance—emotional, spatial, temporal—without authorial commentary; every motif (terrace adrift, maze ethos, weather watched from afar) circles this idea and converges on the final image of unbridgeable clarity. Subtext resides in silence: the father’s love is proved by absence and meteorological notation, a restraint that reconfigures the reader’s understanding of abandonment. No explanatory paragraph intrudes; wisdom stays implicit. The after-effect is a hush in the reader identical to the “fractured hush” of the terrace—an earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“featherly determined,” “spectra fractured”) is idiosyncratic yet internally consistent, reflecting an architect’s daughter who reads patterns for meaning. Rhythm modulates—from long reflective sentences to the clipped CAVOK entry—mirroring her move from uncertainty to crystalline insight. No dialogue, therefore no voice-convergence risk; filter verbs are minimal and character-justified. The lyric elision (“Silence came in pieces”) is patterned early and paid off at close, meriting high-band credit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge (e.g., discovering the father logged her birthdays). Figurative layering is high but coherent—prism/terrace/maze all serve the central metaphor of refracted paths. One mixed metaphor—“distance compressed into a single step” versus “architecture of distance”—is minor enough to sustain the upper band. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; the only bar to 9 is a single near-paraphrase on “light split and reformed,” a micro-slip that slightly dulls the closure sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The corn-maze lineage and weather-code logbook deliver a fresh angle on parental estrangement; the terrace-as-drifting-prism is an inventive externalization of emotional unmooring. Synthesis feels organic rather than engineered: maze → loss of direction, pilot codes → distant watchfulness, spectrum → fractured communication. Risk is taken with the associative structure, but pattern is taught and closure remains legible. Could edge higher with a sharper dramatized moment of the originating quarrel, the one beat that still feels template-adjacent.</comment>
