<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic gift is vividly embodied in every beat; her decision to climb the glacier is driven by a clear vocational wound. The “sculpted hush” moment forces a visible internal reversal—she weeps at proof that wonder is structural. Micro-choices (pressing palm to ice, humming into the aurora) align with her perceptual signature. Cost is legible: she carries silence home, cathedral’s fate left hanging—“oscillating repose” is earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: every aurora ribbon adds density until silence cracks. Closure is a Charged Poise—cavern becomes bell, sky burns, aldermen struck dumb; cost is conceptual (irreversible visibility of wonder). Orientation anchored by ~120 w. Amber sheet alignment is causal trigger; no teleport. Grandmother’s map line telegraphs rule early; pattern taught, closure paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as micro-setting: ridges mapped by amber sheet, aurora ceiling becomes resonating chamber. Body-tool-object triad met—amber sheet handled twice, ice formation touched, lantern tracks spatial arc. “Vaulted ceilings of blue-white ice” is selective, not catalog. Cold narrows perception to color-sound synesthesia. Final image of sky burning above cathedral re-weights environment as broadcast medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—signaled in paragraph 4. Tightening occurs when aldermen’s vote triggers glacier quest; second tightening when sculpted hush offers literal silence that must be broken. Protagonist agency drives both: she sings the aurora, unfetters hush. Cost is civic—cathedral future uncertain—but felt in her weeping, oscillating repose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: bells, resonance, silence, architecture. Statement “wonder is not ornamental but structural” is dramatized, not asserted. Final sky-burn re-prices municipal aesthetics without sermon. Subtext in “amber music sheet” as both map and heirloom ties personal lineal memory to public art. Ambiguity lingers: will cathedral survive? Theme benefits from unanswered question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure—“ringing like a bell” sentence fragments echo actual toll. Diction stays within lyric-mystic register justified by vocation. “Prismatic crystal,” “spectral light,” “oscillating repose” are coinages that feel native to her cognition. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature—passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences climb, fragment cracks at hush release. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—silence as knot, cavern as bell. Opening line is arresting; final line cadence reprises “bell toll” without cliché. Minor uplift: “irreversible visibility of wonder” could compress, but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthesia-bell-ringer + aurora-as-score is fresh synthesis. Amber topographic sheet transforms map into musical notation—specific, irreplaceable. Sculpted hush reverses expected trope (silence as absence) into presence with weight. Risk in lyric escalation pays off: cathedral sky-burn feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails if bells are bronze—here crystal prisms change physics of resonance. +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
