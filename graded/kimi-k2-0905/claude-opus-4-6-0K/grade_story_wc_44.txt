<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s “quietly deliberate” trait is shown through the meticulous unlocking ritual, but interior contradiction is muted; her final transformation reads more as cosmic coronation than costly choice. No competing want vs. fear is dramatized, so the arc feels inevitable rather than struggled-for. Still, the embodied rune-work and key-handling keep her idiosyncratic and grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Maren becomes the “place shadows return to,” a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is internal—each seal rewrites her perceptual rules—so the because/therefore chain is logical within the fabulist frame. The Orientation Test is waived; deliberate disorientation pays off in the final image. If a sharper external obstacle or risk had surfaced, the cost would feel sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The floating nocturnal observatory is sketched with selenite veins and brass instruments that double as tools of discovery; space folds at noon, turning setting into mechanism. Sensory hierarchy is rune-scholar—light, geometry, mineral glow—keeping detail selective. The seventh-seal chamber acts as micro-setting that directly enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes are legible early: find vanished shadows. Each unlocked seal tightens the conceptual cost—memory-storage, flat-space, doorway—so pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist or ticking clock raises physical jeopardy, keeping escalation cerebral; the final unfurling of stored shadows is a beat of revelation more than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge is not discovered but inhabited—understanding rewrites the seeker. The recursive shadow/light loop refracts this without sermon. Final image of seven shadows at once reweights prior glyphs into bodily consequence, achieving resonance without moral statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction skews technical-runic (“selenite prisms,” “symbolic loop”) yet remains lyrical. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long cadence for study, staccato for seal activations. No dialogue, so voice is carried through tactile description and keyed gears; perceptual signature is distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—world-rule plus sensory hit—without scaffold. Metaphors (“curling spacetime like soft metal”) are controlled and brief; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“each time… each time”) but it occurs early and does not obscure causality or dull the final unfurling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent reality hook is playful yet immediately justified by the noon-shadow anomaly. Rune-locked knowledge-as-physical-transformation feels fresh, and the recursive key-as-glyph closure is inevitable in hindsight. Risk is conceptual rather than plot-risk; still, the synthesis of epistemic mystery and bodily cost is memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her rune-decisions drive every seal-opening beat; removing the scholar identity collapses the entire causal chain.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Key handled in all seven beats, geometry changes with each turn, and its silhouette becomes the final glyph—irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings dictate the story’s ritual structure; each seal rewrites perceptual rules and narrows options.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Deliberateness slows her pace, visible in seventeen-notebook prep and obsessive tracing; the trait costs time and keeps her isolated.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Relearning is the explicit action of every seal—dismissing paradox, reweighting shadow—culminating in her self-redefinition.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closing loops is the physical method engraved in stone and enacted with the key; mechanics matter at every turn.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nocturnal observatory supplies sole access to noon-light aperture and sealed chamber; setting enables the unfurling climax.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bent-reality timeframe creates the vanished-shadow anomaly, but no inner clock or deadline pressures choices; functions as premise more than ticking clock.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quest to locate missing shadows is stated early and re-asserted each seal; final discovery fuses with her body, paying off the desire at cost.</comment>
