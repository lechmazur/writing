<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Maren’s want-to-capture-time trait is cleanly planted; her shift to letting go is dramatized in the walk-down. Interiority can tilt toward abstraction (“luminous ache”) and moments like “she understood, finally” are declared rather than embodied. Still, one contradiction—fixer forced to accept unfixed—drives the arc and the final gesture costs her her exile, so motivation mostly earns its turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure achieves Charged Poise: open dome + spinning clock reweight the premise with felt cost—she loses refuge. Orientation is clear; causality is loose but acceptable under lyric mode. The earthquake is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. One soft spot: “she understood, finally” narrates the insight just before the image that should carry it alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Observatory, cloud-sea, and ruined dome are sketched with spare, evocative strokes; telescope ribs and spinning hand provide micro-setting that focuses attention. Sensory range is narrow (mostly sight and metaphoric sound) yet selection mirrors Maren’s lens-polisher eye. No spatial confusion. The setting directly shapes the last choice—open dome—so it constrains closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: freeze moments vs. release them. Tightening occurs when quake smashes her capture-tools; choices narrow to rebuild old way or embrace un-capture. Cost is legible in shattered lenses and exile abandoned. Escalation is single bump, not growing chain; agency is mostly reactive, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of relinquishing control emerges through ruined instruments and the surrendering last image, avoiding explicit motto. Subtext resonates in spinning hand = liberation, not malfunction. Final “speed of letting go” lands as conceptual re-pricing. Some lines risk mild profundity (“escape velocity of hours”), but complexity holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s instrument-centric diction; rhythm swells and contracts with quake. Filter verbs minimal,隐喻密度高 yet patterned early so legible. No head-hop. Occasional elevated phrasing—“escape velocity of hours”—skirts register drift but fits her tech-poetic mind. Voice distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion: sentences multi-task, paragraphs lean. Metaphors occasionally layer three-deep but pattern is taught and doesn’t clog peak beats. Tiny loop: “same sunrise… same cloud layer… same silence” reads intentional echo. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance cleanly. No typos or pronoun drift. High density almost throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Blending camera-repair sage, unfixable clock, and open-air observatory yields fresh amalgam of familiar motifs. Core insight—accepting unfixable motion vs. frozen capture—is non-obvious and felt. Could transplant to new names with some survival, but specificity of lens language and lunar altitude gives local friction. Risk present but moderate.</comment>
