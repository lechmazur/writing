<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“felt it in the marrow of her wrists”), obsession drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned. Flaw: no contradiction in-scene—she never wavers—so pressure stays intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence page layers density until the final glyph reweights the world. Closure is a Charged Poise—the map completed as the last star dies—cost legible in flaking gold and permanent darkness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-grooved stones, horizontal rain, ink-black valley: every detail filters through her narrow attention. The booklet’s flakes catching the final starlight directly charge the last image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the endless night”—tightens once: from collecting silences to drawing the terminal glyph. Agency is attention, not action; the cost is cosmic yet abstract, so pressure feels faintly academic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: structure within annihilation. The spiral/asymptote glyph reconfigures prior silences into corridors of deeper quiet—conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays close to her sensorium; diction (“ambered hush,” “resin closing around an insect”) is consistent and patterned. Rhythm swells then thins with the vanishing star, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops, metaphors grounded in her craft; occasional poetic elevation (“tender than she had imagined”) skirts purple but remains in-character. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mapping silence onto an apocalypse of extinguished stars is a fresh synthesis; the gold-leaf codex makes the abstraction tactile. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final image.</comment>
