<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—yearning to inscribe while refusing ink—grounds every beat; the final stillness costs her immediate triumph and is earned through prior micro-choices. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped. Interiority remains concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Competence balanced by genuine intellectual risk; flaw (over-caution) directly enables the charged poise of the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren’s renunciation of inscription at the last second reweights stakes with felt opportunity-cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Anchors (who/where/when) clear by 120 words; no orientation penalty. Causality intact: every flight of reflection loops back to the inkless nib, sustaining tension. Persistent constraint—the Convocation’s inevitability rule—shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and lake-ice parchment literally constrain method (cold preserves potential ink) and charge the final image (spire dawn-lit, shadowless). Selective sensory detailing—iron air, translucent vellum—filters through Maren’s cartographer priorities. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—birth of a new science under prohibition—signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: model confirms convergence, foreclosing option to wait; cost is tomorrow’s public exposure. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: density of aligned variables escalates toward stillness. No reversal needed; stance crystallization suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation as listening, not rebellion. Kingfisher dive reweighted in final image—ink color of prophetic water-breach—offers non-literal answer to thematic question. No moralizing; complexity preserved (constraint both stifles and refines). Epiphany earned through iterative modeling, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction calibrated to Maren’s scholarly precision without academic drift. Syntax grows shorter under pressure—“The model held.” Distinct perceptual signature: noticing blank spaces, vibration convergence. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Pattern-taught elision (“She did not write. Not yet.”) paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances character, concept, or atmosphere. Figurative language selectively deployed; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato declaratives at peak. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; occasional elevated noun pairs (“charged silence,” “conceptual repricing”) remain within POV lexicon and serve theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—cartography of ignorance—feels fresh and non-obvious. Constraint-driven innovation angle subverts usual rebellion trope. Kingfisher-feather nib and lake-ice vellum are specific, irreplaceable objects. Final image synthesizes all elements so that substitution would collapse meaning. Risky lyric stillness chosen over conventional triumph, heightening coherence.</comment>
