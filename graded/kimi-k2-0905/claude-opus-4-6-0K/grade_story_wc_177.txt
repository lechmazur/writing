<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—being trapped between temporal horizons yet craving the present—is vivid and embodied. Micro-choices (touching the seal, pressing it) dramatize her shifting hierarchy of values. The final renunciation costs her the safety of detached vision and is earned by prior beats. Only minor shortfall: no secondary pressure since she is alone, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: she completes the sentence, becomes the walking, costs herself her detached vantage. Causal linkage holds: seal activates directives, floods her with archive experience, collapses temporal buffer. Orientation is taught early via bunker cues and repeated “yesterday/tomorrow” signals; no penalty owed. One tightening beat suffices; no structural drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete bunker/vine mesh constrains movement and supplies sensory immediacy; storm’s barometric drop forces the final act. Environmental layers breathe without stalling momentum. Spectral data-archive “setting” counts as tool that reweights choice. Could edge higher only if spatial choreography were stress-tested by more than one body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing the present without annihilating self—tightens once when the terminal shrieks and the seal becomes the last live option. Escalation is singular but sufficient; price (loss of safe omniscience) is legible immediately after. No external antagonist needed. Meets 8+ threshold for causal pressure forcing stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: only by relinquishing omnitemporal vision can agency exist. Subtextual irony—decay erodes authority but frees her—reconfigures premise without moralizing. Final image reweights “monitor/record” into embodied walking. No abstract thesis clutter; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distorted lyric cadence taught on line 1 (“foresight hindsight only”) and sustained: clauses layer like moss; verbs germinate. Perceptual signature sticks to POV; no head-hop. Syntax modulates under storm stress—sentence fragments mimic breathlessness—yet clarity holds. Registers never drift into academic filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences often twin-load imagery & causality (“vines threaded…breathed audibly”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates into storm without drumbeat monotony. One mixed vehicle (“fist made of sky”) is forgivable at this pressure and does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Temporal seam-walker trope is refreshed by collapsing archive language into ecology, making decay literally vegetal. Directive that forgets itself while teaching the lesson is a playful inversion of AI trope. Final fusion of bunker, storm, and body feels inevitable yet unwritten before. Specific diction (“wafer seal…communion host”) prevents swap-ability.</comment>
