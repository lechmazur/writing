<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marina’s longing to “learn the rhythm of belonging” is anchored early and visibly governs her choice to stay past curfew; the burnt-feather talisman externalizes her private need and is handled twice with meaning. Interiority is concrete (“felt like a foreign body the facility was trying to reject”) and her micro-choice to share the charts with Kosta shows values in hierarchy. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict is stated more than enacted, and the final shift to belonging is gentle rather than costly—still earned, but barely staked. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared exhale under the plankton “fireflies” crystallizes belonging without declaring it, cost felt in the anonymity of dawn that can’t be seen. Causal linkage is light—she stays because she wants connection—but the accumulative pattern of staying-up / sharing language / witnessing bloom holds. Orientation is complete by line 20; no lens ambiguity. The ending image reweights the premise, meeting 9+ test, yet stakes remain low-grade emotional, not irreversible. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drowned Pavlopetri is evoked with tactile specificity: pressure-treated glass, silted courtyards, current shift before dawn. The facility itself—creaking under pressure, lights simulating unseen dawn—functions as a micro-setting that constrains action (can’t leave, must share airlock knock ritual). Visual dominance is justified by observation-domes, yet acoustic and kinesthetic details (cup of reconstituted coffee, feather’s lattice catching biolum-light) widen the palette. Final image of city glowing through dome glass charges the closure, satisfying 9+ gate for setting-into-image. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“will she belong?”—is signaled early and tightens only once: she chooses to stay past lights-out and open her private language to Kosta. That act forfeits solitude but no tangible resource; cost is atmospheric, not consequential. Escalation is thus a single soft deepening rather than irreversible narrowing; pressure stays situational and low. Meets short-form allowance of one meaningful turn, but lacks visible price that alters later tactics. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as luminous respite emerges through image pattern (feather, plankton, fireflies) without explicit thesis. Subtext carries in gesture—offering coffee, setting feather between them—so final shared breath reconfigures isolation into communion. No late moralizing; the insight is earned. Complexity is modest: no counter-argument or moral ambiguity, so resonance is warm but not unsettling. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tertiary-limited POV stays locked to Marina; perceptual signature is consistent—“sprawl of collapsed temples read like constellations,” “softly ingenious shorthand.” Syntax flexes with emotional intensity, no head-hop. Kosta’s dialogue is minimal and indistinct, but within tolerance for a two-page scene. Voice never drifts into explanatory overdrive; compression is purposeful. High-band gate met. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths vary, openings avoid mechanical “She… She…,” sentences carry double duty (ex: “She set the burnt feather on the console between them like an offering, its dark lattice catching the plankton light.”). Minor overworld metaphors (“ galaxies,” “fields ignite”) are sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One scaffold echo—“belonging”/“rhythm” repeated—dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Fusion of landscape astrology with underwater archaeology feels fresh; burnt feather as fire-in-water talisman is specific, not symbolic convenience. Premise avoids token quirk by tying chart-language to needed plot beat. Risk is moderate—lyric rather than dramatic—but coherence justifies the choice. Not transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight, hence stays below 8.5. </comment>
