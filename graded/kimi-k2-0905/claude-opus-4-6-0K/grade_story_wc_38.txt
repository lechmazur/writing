<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory drive—prove bureaucrats wrong vs. embrace the very “unreliability” they condemned—plays out in embodied micro-choices (each pirouette decodes). Cost is legible: she seals the airlock on the only world that ever validated her. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; the final renunciation is earned. Hairline slip: “recognized in her bones” skirts cliché edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ascending bubbles re-weight all prior beats—she descends no more. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (“trusting the structure…”) crystallizes options with felt cost (lab abandoned, surface skepticism awaits). Causality intact: dice roll → dance → cipher unlock → ascent. No orientation debt; anchors clear by sentence four.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains every move—rusty cable, wet steel floor, trapped air pockets determine gait and breath; bioluminescent algae become the ceiling she dances against. Specificity filters through Maren’s professional eye (“barnacles had not yet claimed”). Final silver bubbles echo algae glow, charging the image. Micro-setting (puddle reflection) hosts the self-recognition beat—setting as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: vindicate intuitive encryption before institutional erasure. One tightening: decoding the dice via dance finalizes the method, foreclosing anonymity—she must surface and risk ridicule. Cost visible: abandoning the only habitat that honors her. Agency drives every increment; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: vulnerability encoded becomes unbreakable armor. Journal line “refusal to need armor” re-prices prior rejections. Image of luminous algae outlasting flood answers thematic question non-literally. Complexity intact—no moral scolds reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: “green-black water,” “trembling aquamarine” mirror her oscillating doubt/defiance. Syntax lengthens during submerged pirouette, compresses on ascent—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No head-hop; diction within poet-cryptographer lexicon. Final spider simile reprises opening cadence, tying bow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided; “silver bubbles… caught the last green light” precise. Occasional elevated diction (“continental shelf,” “kinesthetic memory”) justified by POV expertise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Emotional-encryption-via-dance is non-obvious; sunken research station as classroom feels inevitable in hindsight. Trope of dismissed genius flipped: she weaponizes the dismissal itself. Spider-web motif bookends without gimmickry. Risky lyric structure paid off—closure legible, stakes personal.</comment>
