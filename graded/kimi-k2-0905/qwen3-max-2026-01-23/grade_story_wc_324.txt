<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete (“her curiosity a steady anchor”) and her micro-choice—pressing the hearing aid to her ear—embodies both trait and stake; the renunciation of credit at the end (“without intention or fanfare”) lands as earned cost. Only the near-perfect emotional calibration when she addresses Lily keeps this from 9+.

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mist’s pearlescent glow and rising chorus reweight the premise, showing Elara’s single assurance to Lily amplifies every waiting voice. Causal chain holds—tracing pulse → deciphering message → delivering assurance → ambient echo—each step visible on the page with felt cost (her anonymity, the fading twilight hush).

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist-clad atrium, marble veined like frozen rivers, and the white-rose arbor are selective, POV-filtered, and return charged in the final glow; the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrains every action. Spatial clarity tracks cleanly from archway to shelves; only the social-worker entrance feels slightly telegraphed.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect Arthur’s last whisper—tightens once when the pulse resolves into the precise key/rose message; Lily’s visible straightening shows the cost has landed. No secondary reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—“heroism as cumulative small kindnesses”—emerges through the final pearlescent chorus, reweighting the atrium’s silence without moralizing. The white rose reprises as courage rather than symbol grafted late; ambiguity lingers about how many voices still wait.

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—“veined like frozen rivers,” “rhythmic vibration straining against oblivion”—syntax lengthens then compresses with her focus. No head-hop; social worker remains externally observed.  
</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from violet-tinged lyric to clipped “She did not mention the hearing aid,” propelling without scaffold; only one soft loop (“fragile” twice in four lines) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure.

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is fresh, yet the piece’s real ingenuity is sonic archaeology—extracting love from corroded circuits—made inevitable by tactile specifics. Risky lyric elevation pays off when the ambient chorus answers Lily’s smile.
