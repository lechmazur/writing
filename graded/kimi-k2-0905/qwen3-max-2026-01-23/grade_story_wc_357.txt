<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motive (save the groves) is clear and constant; the arrow-tip’s warming gives tactile micro-feedback that keeps desire embodied. Interiority stays rooted in sensory cues—water ribbons, phantom rain—so emotion never drifts into label-speak. The final renunciation (“not to harvest, but to protect”) is credibly earned by the pool-test with the twig, showing cost on the page. What keeps this from the 9-band is the absence of live contradictory impulse: once the arrow glows he follows without hesitation or temptation to exploit the source, so pressure never complicates his identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mission pivots from extraction to guardianship and the cost is the foregone “trophy,” legible in the final image of empty hands carrying “only certainty.” Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous vein, echo, and accelerated blossom adds density until the covenant is revealed. Orientation is anchored by word 26 (“Veridia’s gravity inverted”) and the inversion clock keeps time; no penalty applies. The single minor warp is the late introduction of the “Cradle Arch” moments before it becomes the decisive location—still, the water-stream map has prepped the reader, so the beat lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s engine: inverted gravity, floating stone arches, and upward-flowing water create spatial rules that actively steer the skiff and shape the climax. Selective sensory triage—silver bark, luminous ribbons, “forgotten stone tears”—keeps description lean yet otherworldly. The orchard itself supplies the final constraint: the pool of radiance that re-grows the twig, fusing environment and choice into one image. Only the mossy landing-pad coda feels generic, a minor drop from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the western groves—threads every beat; each new wonder (real-time fruiting, echo-sensations) intensifies the question of whether Kael will take or tend. The meaningful tightening occurs when he dips the withered twig: the instant renewal proves the source’s power and simultaneously forces the ethical fork—harvest vs. reverence—so options narrow with visible price. Agency remains one-directional; once the arrow vibrates he never seriously considers exploitation, so pressure plateaus rather than compounds. Still, the single fork is credible and on-page, satisfying short-form escalation.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as “resilience is remembrance tended by reverence,” distilled through the gathering of echoes rather than stated until the final paragraph. The broken arrow-tip’s shift from compass to listening-device reweights its meaning without authorial nudging. Subtext resides in silence: the absence of engine noise mirrors the refusal to exploit, letting quiet itself become the moral stance. A hair below 9 because the last sentence articulates the theme outright, slightly dampening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptions; diction (“rootward toward the sky,” “liquid veins”) carries a lyrical cadence that differentiates the piece from stock SF adventure. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; sensory filters (“phantom weight of ripe fruit”) keep psychic distance close. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for wonder, clipped beats at the climax (“He had discovered…”). The voice never breaks character or drifts into exposition, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences advance either navigation or revelation. Figurative language is selective—“stone tears,” “living map”—and avoids purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the arch labyrinth. A single mixed metaphor (“covenant” after “heart”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band in reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour orchard with upward-flowing water as a navigation system feels fresh, and tying resilience to ancestral auditory memory rather than a resource-extraction MacGuffin upends typical quest logic. Specificity—“woven-willow skiff,” “silver-barked trees”—grounds the wonder in tactile detail. The synthesis of ecological ethics with inverted physics produces an inevitable yet non-obvious closure image. Risk in structure and concept pays off without obscuring clarity, sitting at the edge of exceptional.</comment>
