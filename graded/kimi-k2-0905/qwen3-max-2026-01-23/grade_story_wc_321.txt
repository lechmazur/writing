<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-choices—keying the mayday, humming the shanty—so motivation stays embodied. No interior contradiction or flaw complicates him, so the arc is flat; the cost is paid only as external spectacle, not as personal change. Still, his steady seamanship under fracturing reality feels individual and keeps the piece afloat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty hourglass flipped, the warm pulse in his palm, the city noise re-anchored—cost is the permanent transient burden he now carries. Causal chain is thin (how does humming + star-pattern = fix?) but the accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density tightens until the mandala fuses. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight ferry, spectral grotto, and sideways-clock are sketched with sensory economy; star-lit stone walls and spinning bridge clock constrain tempo and tactics. The empty hourglass becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the dissolves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore everyone to normal reality—is signaled early and escalates through sensory dissolution and radio echoes. One meaningful tightening: the empty hourglass appears, forcing Leo to intuit the flip gesture that fuses timelines. Cost is cosmic, not personal, so pressure feels abstract in the final third; still, agency remains with Leo throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of quiet guardianship emerges from Leo’s unnoticed labor and the commuter bubble; the permanent transient idea reweights the ending without moralizing. No motif is forced; star patterns and hourglass accumulate meaning through use. Subtext stays in gesture—turning an empty glass—avoiding platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Leo’s perceptual filter; diction is maritime-plain yet lifts into lyric register when reality frays. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during flickers, longer cadences in grotto calm. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; voice remains distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“patterns swirled, flowing like liquid mercury”) is minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Clean copy, clear sequence, strong momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-ferry trope is refreshed by treating it as accumulative pattern fracture rather than horror jump-scare. Empty hourglass as reset key feels non-obvious; star-map radio tuning marries celestial and nautical. Risk in lyric cosmic scope pays off without losing clarity.</comment>
