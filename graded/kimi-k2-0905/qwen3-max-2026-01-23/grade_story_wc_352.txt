<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s prism-mind is vividly interiorized through sensory synesthesia and micro-choices (tracing moss, tears cutting dust). The decades-long quest is embodied, not declared, and the final “latent blaze” crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: doodle → decoded grotto → inversion window → threshold step → sequences harvested. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the combinations are living seeds she must now replant, cost etched in memory. Orientation, lens, and cost all land on the page; no leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist, salt, chronometer, gravity-flipped stalactites—every environmental note constrains movement or marks time. The grotto’s bioluminescent moss is both map and timer, charging the final image. Micro-setting (her grandfather’s chronometer) literally dictates the sixty-minute window; removal would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased ancestry—tightens into three concrete vault codes revealed only if she risks the inversion. The sixty-minute clock visibly narrows options; failure cost is foreshadowed by her prior “minutes-late” scar. Price is felt: tears, soft landing, and the new burden to replant seeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as cultivated vigilance—emerges through the living moss “seeds” rather than assertion. The ending reweights the doodle from idle curiosity to generational responsibility without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: whose histories, whose silence? Resonant, non-literal, and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s synesthetic lens: “prism-mind fractured reality,” “cool as silk.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under time pressure. No head-hop; diction stays within her arcane-archivist lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature holds to the final “clandestinely luminous smile.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “water droplets ascending like liquid stars.” No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. High information density with rhythmic variation; final line lands as cadenced release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inversion-window + bioluminescent Fibonacci moss feels fresh yet inevitable inside archival-fantasy. The “seeds of vigilance” trope is inverted from moral lesson to living mnemonic technology. Risky physics accepted because taught early and paid off. Specificity (739/284/516) prevents generic puzzle-box déjà vu.</comment>
