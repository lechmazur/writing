<comment>Elara’s “gentle meticulous” trait is repeatedly asserted but never complicates her choices or exacts a cost; interiority remains abstract (“burned with quiet urgency,” “felt warm with purpose”) rather than embodied under pressure. The final image of her turning to the next slide crystallizes Earned Stasis, yet the stakes feel intellectual rather than personally costly because the vow’s loss is external to her life.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each sampled frequency tightens the visible decay, culminating in Charged Poise when the projection dies. The before/after is legible—living illusion becomes archived data—and the cost is the irreversible erasure felt in the sensory blackout (“Then, silence.”). No causal break; the Orientation Test is waived because the library’s disorientation is taught early and serves the closure’s hush.</comment>

<comment>The frozen library, ice-bench, and analyzer are not backdrop: they constrain access, demand gloves, and force the precise calibrations that consume the slide. Micro-setting of the lantern slide itself acts as “setting-in-hand,” guiding every micro-choice. The quartz hush is more than mood; it literalizes the soundless vacuum in which meaning must be soldered by data.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue meaning before final fade—is signaled immediately; agency is the measured sampling that progressively strips the vow to numbers, tightening the cost from vivid garden to zero amplitude. One visible price: the slide goes permanently blank, foreclosing any future re-projection. The escalation is textural rather than causal, but the deepening sensory loss reweights the stake effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s transmutation from living illusion to abstract data is enacted, not preached. The final image of Elara turning to the next slide reframes the entire enterprise as endless, quiet rebellion—an anthem without trumpets. No thematic echo articulates a moral; the reader is left to feel the elegiac cost of preservation itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV remains tightly interior to Elara; perceptual signature is scientist-poet (“quartz hush,” “750 terahertz held firm”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with the scanning rhythm, mirroring her meticulous pulse. No head-hopping; diction stays within her calibrated lexicon, and the lyric cadence is pattern-taught early, paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet luminous; metaphors (“mathematical elegy,” “midwifed meaning”) extend the midwife/scientist fusion without mixed-vehicle collisions. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for slow decay, fragments at blackout. Minor loop risk in “gentle meticulous” repeats, but the cadence serves ritual, not filler. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The concept of a frozen cloud-library that archives dying light-vows feels fresh, yet its emotional engine—preservation as loss—is timeless. Specificity of terahertz numbers and the garden-sensory flash prevent abstraction from eclipsing intimacy. The synthesis of hard-SF measurement with lyric elegy is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
