<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her shift from “interrogate stone” to “understand soul” lands via embodied beats (tracing wax, cup warmth). Yet the dead tutor remains off-page memory; Mrs. Davison functions as gentle oracle rather than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is soft. Still, her micro-choice to accept the seal carries visible cost of stewardship. Final renunciation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the seal transfer crystallizes new responsibility and reconfigures her stance toward the building. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (steam, jasmine, meteor light) deepens emotional truth until the agreed-upon lie reframes history with mercy. No orientation debt; transitions clean. Cost is legible in the final weight of the key.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, meteor shower, and wax-seal micro-setting all filter through Elara’s biased attention, constraining her final acceptance. Brick parapet resolving into penitentiary arch is a precise, stake-tilting image. Sensory selection mirrors internal shift without catalog excess. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across teacup, table, seal, door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to listen compassionately—tightens when archival facts are shown to be hollow against living memory. One meaningful deepening: cornerstone date exposed as compassionate fiction reweights her method and forecloses pure excavation. No external antagonist needed; internal vs external conflict fuse neatly. Cost is felt in her renunciation of interrogation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy in history-keeping, beauty grown around scars. Subtext resides in gesture (tracing grooves, closing fingers over seal) rather than statement. Final image reframes prior scratches as song—resonant, non-moralizing. Agreed-upon lie motif recurs with escalating significance, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—selective attention to brick, scent, warmth. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer lyrical coils calm, short clauses under meteor flare. No head-hop; Mrs. Davison’s voice distinct in soft page-turn diction. Free indirect merges seamlessly.</comment>

<comment>Prose maintains high density—every sentence advances character, image, or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled (“meteors scratched ephemeral lines”) without purple drift. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts tight. Final line offers soft punctuation that echoes gate creak—craft precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: architectural empathy via compassionate historiography, conveyed through rooftop tea ritual. Agreed-upon lie reframes familiar “old building secrets” trope into ethical stake. Seal-as-offered-key feels inevitable, not gimmick. Specificity of 1881 penitentiary stones anchors novelty. Risk-taking modest but coherent; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
