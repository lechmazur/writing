<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her stained fingers, spatial mapping of emotion, and the final “hushed thunder” peace all feel earned. The contradiction between her psychometric gift and her need to physically cradle the film shows an active, costly micro-choice. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is a solitary renunciation that lands with visible cost. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic label-speak (“symphony of sorrow”) but it is quickly buried in sensory detail, so the quick-test for 9+ is almost—but not quite—met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the film strip’s secret reweights the premise—unused love lives in negative space, not vaults—delivered in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density of sensory fragments builds until the busker’s lyric reframes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 21 (“vintage movie palace projection booth”) and the taught pattern of memory-ingress pays off at the end. Persistent constraint: the strip must be returned to its can, sealing the renunciation; cost is legible in the transformed silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting: the green-shaded lamp, dust motes, and creaking stairs constrain every move and filter perception. The film strip itself evolves from prop to charged object—cool against her heart, then warm after transfer—directly powering the closure image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms or impossible positions. One hairline slip from 9+ only because the wartime London shard is described more than enacted, but the bench-bound present frame remains primary and decisive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—is signaled in line 12 and tightens once: from seeking a location to accepting it resides in negative space. The renunciation (returning the strip) forecloses further search with visible cost under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the quest. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering until the busker’s lyric triggers the culminating reframe. A hairline short of 9+ only because the escalation is single-wave rather than compounding, but cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and event: celluloid grains, unsent letters, negative space. The final Conceptual Repricing—“archived in the mercy of release”—offers resonant, non-literal wisdom without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (trembling kiss sealing envelope) and silence pooling like water. No thematic echo or platitude mars the ending; the insight feels discovered, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet always legible; syntactic parallelism (“hills of joy, valleys of sorrow”) is taught early and paid off in the final spatial map. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices texture, temperature, spatial voids—never head-hops. Rhythm swells with the busker’s melody then subsides into acceptance, mirroring pressure. One negligible filter verb (“she felt”) is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective (“tear stains blooming like tiny maps”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif flawlessly. Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses crystal-gazing with celluloid psychometry—fresh, non-obvious, yet inevitable in hindsight. The “spatial negative” answer reweights familiar wartime-love tropes through specific cinematic ontology. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss, heightening thematic coherence. Removing any shard (busker,Developer fluid, lacquered box) would collapse the lattice; synthesis is total.</comment>
