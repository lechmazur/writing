<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet radicalism is vividly embodied—her mending of stones, the cobalt shard in her pocket, the deliberate kneel to brush ash. Interior contradiction is alive: the same object that triggers traumatic flashbacks becomes the tool of reclamation. The final release is earned: pressing the tessera into wet mortar literalizes her shift from trapped witness to architect of mercy. Minor slip: “aberrant mercy” is named twice in summary voice; dramatizing the elders’ scorn through a single shouted line would have pushed this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every descriptive layer (ash, chipped tesserae, steel beams) accretes meaning until the renaming act crystallizes the new emotional economy. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “Sanctuary of Echoes” reweights every prior absence into invitation. Cost is felt—the trapped memories soften, foreclosing her old identity as perpetual mourner. One hairline slip: the laughter of children arrives as off-stage coincidence rather than caused arrival, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shattered sky, powdered-bone ash, and the cobalt shard form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move. The plaza’s negative-space mosaic literally guides her reading technique and final inscription; without its chipped bird-and-seed silhouette the renaming would lack motive. Steel beam’s “warm coldness” is touched at the exact moment of internal thaw, fusing body/tool/climate. Gate met: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the plaza will remain a tomb or become a teacher—tightens once: the act of renaming forecloses the elders’ ideology of forgetting. Pressure is textural rather than causal: each sensory layer (ash, fractured sky, laughter drifting closer) deepens the cost of remaining frozen. Aberrant mercy is the visible price: she risks civic scorn to offer compassion a foothold. No visible resource loss (tool, stamina, coin) but the softening of traumatic memory is an undeniable internal forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from negative-space literacy: absence can be reread as invitation. The final image—sunbeam igniting the embedded shard—replies non-literally to the elders’ “dangerous folly” charge: mercy is not fragile but refractive, able to split light into future color. No explicit moral; the children’s hesitant laughter lets the plaza itself argue the case. One echo of prompt language (“aberrant mercy”) keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: ash “whispered,” sky “shattered into permanent fractures,” steel carries a “warm coldness.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short clauses under memory flashes, mirroring her cognitive stutter. No head-hopping; the children’s laughter is reported as exterior sound she notices, not interiorized. Voice modulates with pressure yet retains cathedral-quiet diction throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences (“to cradle empathy…”) give way to staccato fragments at the renaming beat. Figurative language is selective—one sky metaphor, one bone-ash simile—avoiding density overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” and “resonant reconfiguration” are evaluator meta-terms, not story diction, but they appear only in this rubric, not on the page itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban-planning as trauma therapy, cartography of absence read through mosaic negative space. The retrocognitive-flash trope is repurposed as civic design problem—she rebuilds the city so the flash becomes compass instead of trap. Children’s laughter as first post-fire sound turns cliché edge into earned payoff because the ground has been literarily prepared to receive it. Risk taken: no antagonist beyond collective memory, yet pressure sustains.</comment>
