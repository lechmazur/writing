<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserve truth vs. wilt near lies—are dramatized in her trembling brush and steady final hand; the child’s candor and neighbor’s confession give embodied pressure that turns the trait into action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The earned renunciation of archival obsession costs her the fantasy of a vault and lands as visible steadiness, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the absence of on-page relationships keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map becomes a mirror, the basin is empty yet full of living breath, and Elara’s new vocation is sealed with gold leaf—cost is the forfeiture of the vault fantasy and the perpetual vulnerability of wilting. Causal chain holds: map fragment → coordinates → slot → chamber → realization → transformed art. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (greenhouse workshop, toxic sky). No lens ambiguity; pattern of accumulative candor tightens once. Meets 9+ cost proof test on the final gold leaf stroke.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—gilded leaf trembling, ochre bruise sky, thorny jasmine—filters through Elara’s truth-seeking attention. The greenhouse glass and dry basin function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice: no water, only breath. Spatial choreography is clean from workshop to market to arch. Environment charges the closure image by forcing candor to become the new medium instead of water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—tightens when the basin reveals they live only in candid breath; this forecloses the archival path with felt cost. Pressure escalates accumulatively: merchant lie → wilt → child’s confession (micro-turn) → elder’s rain grief → zinc warms → chamber empties. No coincidence resolves; final renunciation is active. Could use one earlier visible tactical loss to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth is not stored but transmitted in vulnerable exchange. Subtext lives in silence after the neighbor’s shame—no moral stated, only orchids accepted. Final image of gold catching light reweights the opening gilded leaf from preservation to offering. Avoids thematic echo; child’s line is repurposed as inscription, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person stays inside Elara’s perceptual sieve: “humidity warped,” “zinc grooves revealed.” Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during chamber entry, then exhales into short final sentences. No head-hopping; diction remains within her artisan lexicon. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “toxic sky stained the glass domes ochre” anchors setting, tone, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Figurative language is patterned early (gold, wilting) and paid off. One mixed metaphor—“permanent bruise”—survives because it is taught in the same sentence and does not recur under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher who wilts near lies + postal plate + candor as waterless oasis. The inversion of map-as-mirror rather than destination feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric compression is taught by line 3 and sustained. No trope recycling; even “toxic sky” is grounded in local drought causality.</comment>
