<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—needing truth yet fearing its weight—drives every beat; the shift from accusation to compassion is micro-modeled in her breath-choices and palm-pressure on the shard. Emotions are embodied in shudders, grit-in-boots, vacuum-leached air; no diagnostic labels. Her cyclically spontaneous ability is not merely named but enacted: the tide overtakes her, recedes, then forces her to recalibrate intent under threat of oblivion. Final endurance—accepting the weight as foundation—costs her the clean grief of blame and is earned by the prior resonance failures she viscerally maps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she seeks Kael’s truth, therefore she rides the shard’s resonance; because the weave turns volatile, therefore she redirects intent, collapsing all possible universes into one sacrificial image. Orientation complete by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure is a crystallized CR: the shard re-priced as “crystallized essence of his sacrifice” re-weights every prior sensory map. Cost is felt—she will now weave maps of grace, never again of decay—legible in the final line “tucked the green glass shard into a pouch over her heart,” a compass reforged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The derelict bay is not backdrop but instrument: grit under boot, vacuum-leached air, and phantom light constrain her breathing method for alignment. Shard-as-micro-setting charges the final image; its edges “catch phantom light” echoes in the slanted beam at exit. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible body shifts during tri-dimensional transitions. Sensory selection obeys her mapper profession; notice hierarchy (rust scent before engine roar) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus comfortable blame—tightens when the weave threatens to eject her; agency is her decision to redirect inward intent, narrowing options from pursuit to acceptance. Cost visible: the shard cools, the cyclical tide stabilizes, she forfeits the moral simplicity of sabotage. Escalation tracks because/therefore: each jump intensifies sensory overload until internal recalibration becomes the only remaining move. No coincidence; even the volatile turn is seeded by “unseen cosmic rhythms” established early.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice mistaken for betrayal—emerges from image pattern: absence maps, redirected flow, crystallized weight. No lecture; the insight is earned through sensory dissonance she alone must metabolize. Final silence replaces murmur: reader left to feel the after-resonance of love heavier than truth. The shard’s re-pricing supplies conceptual repricing without moral statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Elara’s mapper brain: catalogued scents, chill metrics, resonance equations rendered in lyric cadence. Syntax scales breath-length to universe jumps—long clauses for roaring past, fragment shards for star-flecked void. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly within her sensory filter. Diction stays inside her professional lexicon; “permacrete,” “durasteel,” “conduits” are handled, not displayed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mimics cyclical surge—repetition of “shift” and “cycle” taught early and paid off when the pattern stills. No filter-verb stacks; every clause either advances spatial transition or interior recalibration. Metaphors are self-consistent: “forgotten prayers” for skeletal ships fits vacuum mysticism. Final line cadence slows to match earned silence, no drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weaving-between-worlds via breath-aligned shard-walk is fresh synthesis of portal fantasy + sensory mapping; trope is inverted—travel is not conquest but witness. Sacrificial-collapse-of-loom twist is seeded by resonance-flaw concept, not retro-fitted. Voice and world logic specific enough that swapping names would break the mapper vocabulary and cyclical tide mechanic. Risk: lyric compression could have blurred causality yet remains legible under causal lens.</comment>
