<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recluse’s quiet endurance is credibly embodied, but the interior contradiction between “astonished” and “habitually tranquil” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final acceptance lands as gentle stasis yet feels lightly earned because the earlier beatwork is almost entirely observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant reframes from chain to bridge via the stained-glass reflection beat, and the soft click of the lid supplies audible cost under an accumulative/textural lens; causality is coherent, orientation clean by line 4, and the single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: the box’s mirrored surface triggers the climactic recognition, and the skeletal apiaries narrow the recluse’s physical choreography; lavender ghosts and dust patterns are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered, though the wider wasteland remains a static backdrop rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stake—“preserve unspoken weight”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies once, when Elias’s ghost turns gaze onto the recluse, reweighting the keeper’s duty from passive vigil to completed bridge; the cost is the lifelong solitude now crystallized, meeting the single-deepening bar for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting glass light: silence as generative, not vacant. The final image of moonlit colors “whispering what words never could” offers a non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in gesture (hand-over-heart) carries the apology, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable distance; diction (“tranquilly perceptive,” “mute eloquence”) is patterned early and pays off in the closing cadence. Syntax modulates—long breaths for calm, fragment-like twitches for ghost flickers—without monotony; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm variably paces the meditation; sentences carry double duty (image + emotional tilt). A few near-adjacent “dust” references flirt with loop, yet figurative logic stays coherent and never obscures the final click. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ghost-apology via stained-glass keeper is fresh; transforming the box into a mirrored bridge for forgiveness avoids genre cliché. Specific apiary detritus and color choreography feel particular, though the broader wasteland frame is familiar; the quiet Conceptual Repricing of silence-as-grace supplies an authentic inflection.</comment>
