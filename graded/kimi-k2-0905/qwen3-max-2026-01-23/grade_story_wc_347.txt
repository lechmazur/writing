<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant caretaker status, blood-oath, and “offhandedly exact” precision are dramatized through micro-choices (plucking the nut, turning it exactly three-quarters). Internal contradiction—instinct to flee vs. duty—acts live in scene, embodied in gravel-grinding boots and pocketing the blueprint. Closure’s “stubborn grace” is earned by prior causality with visible nightly cost. Single-POV keeps interiority concrete; no dialogue dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: every beat is a because/therefore link (missing nut → search → find → assembly → rescue). Orientation anchored by word 26; no prop or rule teleports. Closure: Earned Stasis—she foregoes escape, pockets device, walks back into frost—with felt cost (“every instinct begged her to flee”). Persistent constraint (tomorrow’s ritual) shapes final image; no amnesia or soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cliffside orchard, brass birds, and Sentinel Tree are filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze; every detail (thorny shadows, ticking wings) pressures her ticking clock. Micro-setting of the moss altar and pea-sized nut constrain assembly moves. Final frost crystals on cursed branches mirror her frozen resolve, charging closure without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“guide travelers before frost”—is signaled early and tightens with visible countdown (twilight, first crystals). One meaningful deepening: finding the nut turns impossible rescue into executable plan. Cost is legible: she trades her own escape for strangers’ safety, tomorrow’s ritual now harder. Escalation driven solely by her agency; coincidence absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: blood-oath duty vs. self-preservation, grace found in crude functionality. Final image—rusty birds ticking against cold—reweights “graceless beauty” without moralizing. No symbolic late harvest; the blueprint, nut, and birds accumulate meaning through use. Ambiguity lingers: orchard still cursed, grace still stubborn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction—“offhandedly exact,” “luminescent trails”—is disciplined, within caretaker’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with twilight, breathes after rescue. No filter-verb stacks; sentence variety supports pressure. Voice modulates from grim diligence to exhausted poise without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“ticking like metronomes”). No register drift; “brass-threaded” is precise, not thesaurus-itis. Final line’s “quiet promise kept against the deepening cold” is read-aloud musical without purple prose. Scaffolding stripped; information density high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Familiar tropes—cursed orchard, mechanical birds—are re-forged through caretaker’s exacting pragmatism and the “graceless beauty” frame. Fresh inflection: rescue achieved by leaving luminous absence, not heroic conquest. Risk-taking in compressed lyric causality pays off; closure remains legible. Could not swap nut, blueprint, or frost rules without breaking logic.</comment>
