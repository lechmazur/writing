<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices (soldering, pocketing the censer foot) that externalize contradictory impulses—cling vs. release—until the final wire joins memory to present. The “reverse migration” motive stays legible and intensifies; the earned renunciation (she keeps the broken station) carries visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak; scarred fingers, rosin scent, and moonlit quartz give us a body thinking. Only the phone voice remains off-page, so status dynamics can’t complicate further; still, the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden tableau flickers out, leaving the station still broken yet re-homed inside her. Causal chain is tight—each midnight call → fragment assembly → moon-phase constraint → final circuit—so the lens holds. Cost is incontrovertible: the station stays dark, the calls cease, and she carries the weight forward. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“three nights ago”) and never wavers; no teleporting props or retro-patches appear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The signal station’s cold console, broken dome, and star-crowded sky act as both cathedral and laboratory, constraining her ritual layout and mirroring internal fracture. Micro-setting (the censer foot in pocket, solder smoke in moonlight) repeatedly guides hand placement and timing. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: navigator notices star angles, metal conductivity, incense residue. Final image—moonlight silvering the dish—recharges the opening “indifferent stars,” turning them into witnesses, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim love’s essence through grief’s terrain—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: “Complete the circuit” forces the final solder joint that forecloses denial. No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-moon-phase and accumulative-memory. The price is the irreversibility of loss—station remains broken, calls end—made legible on the last page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; escalation coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative handling of a single shard: bronze foot as compass, mortar, and finally permanent wound. No character moralizes; the resonant reconfiguration is the silent tableau that replaces explanation with image. Ambiguity lingers—will steady hands stay steady tomorrow?—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete. The refusal to fix the station enacts the theme that endurance, not repair, honors what remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains a lyrical yet precise register—“patchwork navigator,” “ geography of loss”—that stays within Elara’s lexicon without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: celestial references, metallurgical verbs, olfactory memory. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at climax, longer cadences during memory tableaux—demonstrating purposeful stylistic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “Soldering a filament to the lotus carving, the scent of rosin summoned Kael” fuses action, sensory trigger, and memory in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and precise. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. One hairline slip—“raw solace” is repeated as label twice—but never in the closure beat, so 9+ remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of analog tech (rotary phone), space-frontier isolation, and incense mysticism feels specific rather than checklist eclectic. “Reverse migration” reframes grief-work as circuitry repair, a fresh angle on the familiar bereavement tale. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist, yet coherence never wavers. If the concept were stripped, the emotional arc would collapse—evidence of non-swappable originality.</comment>
