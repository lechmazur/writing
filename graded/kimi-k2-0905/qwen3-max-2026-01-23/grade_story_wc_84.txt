<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s isolation and need for “belonging” are anchored early and embodied in the tremor when he slots the chip; Elara’s perpetual wonder is shown through gasps and softened tears, not just labeled. The final hand-clasp is a credible, earned micro-choice that dissolves his solitude, paying the emotional cost on the page. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drone triangulation → stone shift → orrery ignition → shared gaze. The reveal of the hollow beneath the flagstone is a decisive physical change that reconfigures both the quest and Kael’s interior void. Cost is legible in the humming floor and his tremoring hands—belonging is no longer abstract. Minor waver: Elara’s arrival is slightly convenient, not causally seeded.</comment>

<comment>Observatory at dusk is more than backdrop: the meridian line and specific flagstone constrain the drone’s final hover, while the brass orrery socket literally shapes the closing image. Sensory economy is tight—amber light, gritty stone sigh, cool chip weight—filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze. The setting’s mechanical logic (star paths, gear tolerances) is learned through action, not dumps, nudging toward 9 but capped by micro-repeat of “brilliant dimness.”</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the orrery’s hum makes the abstract visceral. One meaningful escalation: the drone’s chime shifts the quest from search to recovery, narrowing options to a single stone. Cost is felt in body (tremor) and social risk (sharing the moment with Elara). No secondary reversal is needed at this length.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges prismatically: star charts, crystalline chip, brass gears all refract the same longing without once naming “loneliness.” The closing image of “a home he’d been searching for” in Elara’s eyes reweights every prior sky-chart reference. No thesis statements; the orrery’s golden reconfiguration is the non-literal answer. Only hairline slip is “frequency of belonging” edging toward prompt-echo.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Kael’s tracker gaze: “sharp eyes,” “tablet glow,” “cool weight felt like destiny.” Syntax lengthens under awe—“starlight onto metal type”—then compresses at the click: “A deep hum.” No head-hop; Elara’s interior is inferred through Kael’s perception, maintaining distance control. Voice is distinctive enough for 9-band but keeps one foot in familiar lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm variegates: paratactic drone telemetry gives way to sensuous clause chains, then the staccato “He inserted… click.” No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are spare—”scattered diamond dust”—and physically coherent. Information density high: one sentence can do setting, tool, and emotional tilt. A single tiny repeat of “brilliant dimness” is the only blemish preventing 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Type foundry matrix chip that imprints starlight” is a fresh techno-poetic fusion; the orrery-as-healing-tool reframes steampunk into emotional prosthesis. The pilgrim-drone duo and celestial orrery form a constellation not seen in genre templates. Risk is moderate—lyric tone plus hard sf artifact—but coherence stays intact. Doesn’t push into 9+ because core emotional arc (lonely finder completed by witness) is familiar beneath the gleaming surface.</comment>
