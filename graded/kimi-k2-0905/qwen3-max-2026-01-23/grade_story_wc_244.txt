<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness and jocular-mask are sharply embodied; the shift from crisis-jetsetter to stillness is credible. Only the decisive renunciation of the “cure” motive is slightly rushed—one more micro-choice would lock the cost. Still, interior contradiction and embodied emotion hold under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: passing the stone crystallizes the new mission and forecloses the old. Causal chain is lean but intact—rumor summons → encounter → renunciation → beacon. One transition (memory shard) is cleanly bracketed. Cost is felt in her relinquished talisman and open-ended wait.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station doubles as externalized psyche; cracked clock and mossy bench constrain where bodies can sit and speak. Moon-rock micro-setting anchors two beats—pocket rub, palm transfer—charging closure. Sensory triage fits a logistician’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean in a single-scene window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Loneliness-as-stake is signaled early and tightens when the stranger appears; the act of passing the stone is the visible price that narrows Elara’s future path. Pressure grows under Situational lens: isolation collides with offered connection. One meaningful deepening suffices. Could use one more external obstacle beat to hit 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges through gesture, not sermon: stone-circulation equals care-circulation. Final image reweights ivy from decay to resilient life without moralizing. Subtext in silence after laughter dies carries ache. Avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle-distance that matches contemplative stillness; diction (“ivy-choked silence,” “polite anarchy”) is authorial yet anchored to Elara’s gaze. No dialogue, so voice rests on rhythmic variation and selective metaphor—controlled, no purple drift. Pattern of fractured light / fractured time is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes between long sentence and staccato fragment; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density high—each sentence advances image or motive. One mixed metaphor (“time pooled like spilled ink beneath the frozen clock tower”) barely grazes clarity. Clean proofing, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Disaster-logistician-as-stillness-keeper is fresh; rumor-chain as plot courier inverts standard tech networks. Ivy-beacon station feels specific, not postcard. Risk of sentimental “pass-it-on” trope is offset by moon-rock’s prior history and earned renunciation. Lens stays situational, not gimmick.</comment>
