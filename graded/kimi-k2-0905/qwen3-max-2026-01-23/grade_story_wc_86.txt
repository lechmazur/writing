<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass-owl drawer pull gives Elias a tactile micro-choice in the first third and returns to charge the closing image; his interior contradiction—shame vs. resolve—is shown through grip, pocket-check, and final weight-shift rather than label-speak. The “quiet vow” is dramatized when he insists on moon-phase protocol, a beat that forecloses a faster political win. The only missed opportunity is Minister Kaela remaining a mirror rather than a second crucible; she never pressures his stance, so relationship dynamics stay flat. Still, the earned shift from relic-as-burden to relic-as-resolve lands with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the drawer pull is reweighted from failure-token to insight-key under the waning crescent, cost felt in the line “a lighter, steadier burden.” Causal lens holds—every beat either tightens protocol or softens memory because of Veridian. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (parapet, storm, neutral hour); no penalty. One minor looseness: moon-phase signal is declared philosophical but never shown constraining either side’s tactics mid-scene; still, the final image reuses it, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mist and granite are filtered through Elias’s need for “raw honesty,” not tourist catalog; parapet edges guide cautious foot placement and dagger work. The owl pull functions as micro-setting, its cold brass constraining his grip and later his gait. Weather (wind, shifting mist) times the reveal of Kaela’s delegation, so environment actively stages the exchange. Only nit: no sensory echo of salt despite “salt-stung silence,” leaving the promised taste unparsed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will tonight’s protocol fail as Veridian did?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Elias’s moon-phase rule faces the real-time risk of Kaela’s silent cooperation. One visible price: he forfeits political praise for slower celestial timing, a tactical loss shown, not told. Escalation is micro but sufficient: the mist lift exposes the delegation, forcing the nod that severs captives and, symbolically, his own chains. No second reversal, but the single deepening satisfies short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—recycling failure into guardianship—emerges through the evolving pull and the untethering gesture; no character sermonizes it. Subtext lives in silence: twenty wordless paces carry decades of blood-price, more potent than any apology speech. Final sky “washed clean” reweights the earlier “furrowed hush” without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: nations may still backslide, but the reader feels the cost of that possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elias’s perceptual filter—“furrowed hush,” “tactile anchor”—syntax lengthens for calm, shortens for dagger flash. No head-hopping; Kaela’s interior is withheld, keeping protocol tension. Some sentences flirt with lyric elevation (“aching liminal space”) yet stay justified by his reflective stance. Voice is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong verb choices—whipping, coiled, untether—propel without adverb clutter. One paraphrase loop: “mist coiled…mist-filtered moonlight” inside 40 words; minor, does not recur. Metaphors remain coherent (wind-whipped banner, pearl sliver). No filter-verb stacks; pronouns track cleanly through the silent exchange. Final line lands with crisp resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Taking neutral-ground trope and binding it to lunar synchronization feels fresh; the drawer pull as recycled conscience-anchor personalizes a familiar peace-talk frame. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric over thriller beats—but the piece commits fully. Could swap kingdom names, yet the specificity of weather-timed protocol and owl talisman prevents full template drift. Not groundbreaking, but distinctive enough for short-form elite venue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Negotiator status enables the moon-phase method and the final nod; without it, no authority to set protocol. Yet Kaela never tests his skill, so the role shapes only one visible beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Setup by paragraph 3, handled during dagger flash, and reweighted in final line; removal would collapse the memory loop and closure symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Designates the parapet and forces wordless protocol, shaping the entire staging; however, it never imperils the exchange—could be any border.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Trait justifies moon-phase insistence, costing him speed and political capital; shown, not labeled, in the refusal to rush.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Untether is the climax—ropes fall, captives walk, Elias feels “loosening of invisible chains”; story pivots on this dual liberation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Method is declared early and provides the immutable signal, but mechanics (how both camps watch the same clouded sliver) stay abstract; still, it times the nod and bookends the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Wind and mist choreograph the reveal and hide borders; parapet edges guide dagger placement; weather pressure keeps the scene tense.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Temporal frame is announced (“between apology and forgiveness”) but no ticking clock or deadline alters tactics; mood more than timer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Motivation drives insistence on lunar protocol and anchors the owl pull; final weight-shift proves wisdom is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>“Furrowed hush” permeates early beats and reappears as “quiet reverence,” modulating yet coherent; however, storm clearance shifts tone abruptly without intermediate gradation.</comment>
