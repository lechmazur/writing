<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting, shard handling, ink ritual—but the “death certificate error” backstory is delivered as label, not lived contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is waived; still, her choice to reassemble data lacks a visible alternative path, muting cost. The porcelain shard’s shift from pain to compass is cleanly dramatized, earning a modest arc. Micro-choices are present, yet motivation stays abstract (“wisdom from failure”) rather than pressing a concrete stake against her body or future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: ink patterns, snow, shard, and heartbeat layer into a crystallizing cadence that reweights the ghosted record. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the map of oversight becomes protocol—cost legible in “safeguarded” screen and her steadying 340-count. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One paraphrase loop (“snow continued…blank page”) is minor; it does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Opal dome, iron-gall ink, and porcelain shard function as micro-setting that constrains ritual movement; shard edge literally channels ink. Snow outside mirrors internal erasure but never overrules action. Spatial track holds: she pours, folds, pockets, turns. Observatory rules stay consistent—server hum, starlight fracture—without exposition dump. Environment supplies both tool and metaphor, charging the final map image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconstitute erased identity before system repeats error. Escalation is textural—each ink stroke thickens pattern density, narrowing possibility from chaos to blueprint. No external antagonist; pressure is systemic negligence made flesh in flickering server glow. Cost is conceptual but felt: the ghost dissolves into “safeguarded” protocol, foreclosing her anonymity. One meaningful tightening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ink map: data systems must remember the living. Subtext lives in shard-turned-compass, silver-dried ink, and 340-count heartbeat—objects re-weighted without sermon. Final image reconfigures premise: verification protocols now “honor the living,” a conceptual repricing earned by ritual labor. Ambiguity remains—will bureaucracy truly change?—but resonance lingers in the observatory’s hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors crystalline fractals, neural blooms, counted beats—distinctive without purple drift. Syntax lengthens during ink ritual, then contracts at closure, mirroring tension release. No dialogue to distort. Free indirect stays clean: “She knew her work extended…” matches her lexicon. Voice coherence holds under pressure; shard and ink metaphors accumulate rather than contradict.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; information density high—each line layers sensory, emotional, symbolic work. One paraphrase loop (“snow…blank page”) and one mixed metaphor (“ink bloomed like a neural map”) are minor, do not blur closure. Strong verbs dominate; nominalizations absent. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif. Zero scaffold or template cadence in final third; 9-band remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Digital ghost + bureaucratic erasure + ink divination fuses SF and lyric essay in a fresh configuration. Ritual defragmentation via porcelain shard re-tools familiar “correction of record” trope into tactile mysticism. Specificity—iron-gall chemistry, opal dome resonance—anchors novelty. Risk-taking (systemic failure met with ceremonial tech) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Not quite 9+ because premise could still transplant to another setting with minor edits.</comment>
