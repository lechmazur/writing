<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s dual lens—engineer’s precision versus empathic attunement—drives every micro-adjustment and is paid off in the tactile filing of the key. Interior contradiction is dramatized through bodily pressure (eyes, chest) rather than abstract labels, and the final earned stasis is visible when the warm key becomes a “living extension,” foreclosing further action for the night. Flaws are limited: competence dominates struggle, and the lineage motive is stated more than tested. A hairline slip: “logically emotional” is self-diagnosed rather than enacted in first beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stabilizer fail ➔ descent ➔ iterative tuning ➔ harmonic silence, each beat altering the next. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the Chime’s unwavering gold and the key’s residual warmth make the cost of sustained vigilance legible without exposition. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Only the “forgotten method” arrives late as off-stage knowledge, a mild causality wrinkle that slightly dims cost traceability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure source: salt-bleached coat, frost-thick crypt air, and ice-window vantage all constrain movement and amplify sonic stakes. The key’s shifting temperature—cold shard to warm pulse—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. For 9+ gate, environment directly shapes the tactic (vibrational matching) and final image, meeting the constraint requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the Chime—is signaled early and tightened when the harmonic stabilizer shatters, forcing a single live option: vibrational matching. Escalation is iterative rather than reversed, but each strike-listen-refine cycle narrows error and raises psychic cost until silence lands. Price is visible in bodily fatigue and the key’s residual hum. Missing a secondary loss (tool, time, social credit) keeps it shy of 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges through action: dissonance embraced, not destroyed, culminating in sacred silence that “felt earned.” No character moralizes; the concept is reweighted when the same beam that opened the scene now sweeps an absolved marina. Ambiguity lingers—harmony is temporary, vigilance perpetual—without tidy thesis. Avoids thematic echo penalties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays locked to Elara with perceptual signature attuned to vibration, starlight, salt. Syntax lengthens during tuning sequences, then compresses at silence, mirroring sonic expansion/contraction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Diction remains within plausible engineer-poet lexicon; only “fleshly” edges toward self-conscious lyricism, but pattern is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences do dual duty: “the artifact flickered desperately, its serene glow dimmed” marries internal and external states without paraphrase. Rhythm breathes—long clauses during resonance, stark fragments at silence. One scaffold echo: “this was vibrational matching / this was sonic absolution” risks thesis restatement but functions as ritual anaphora. No mixed metaphors or register drift; minor loop penalty forgiven because repetition serves liturgical cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse guardian trope is refreshed by sonic engineering mechanic and star-iron tuning fork keyed to emotion. Vibrational forgiveness as conflict resolution feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—the thumbnail filing of microscopic ridge—grounds the ethereal concept. Risk is moderate; could push further by letting harmony fail partially to raise stakes.</comment>
