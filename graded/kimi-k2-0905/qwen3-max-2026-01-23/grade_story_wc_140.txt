<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nameless archivist’s hunger for “texture of memories” is visceral and consistent; every micro-choice—smoothing the aconite label, layering fragments in the tin—embodies his trait. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation—accepting perpetual namelessness while anchoring another’s erased life—carries visible cost in the closing image. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density until the poison label reweights the stake, crystallizing the keeper’s purpose. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tide’s return and the foghorn reconfigure meaning without dissolving tension. Cost is legible in the final line: “ready to collect the next whisper” forecloses any future claim to identity. Orientation is taught by word 30; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop; its narrow canyons dictate stealthy movement, the moss-streaked crevice literally shelters the archive. The aconite label’s “ghost of earth and toxicity” is micro-setting that charges the final image. Salt-laced wind and rust stains are filtered through the POV’s synesthetic ear for “punctuation.” Environment constrains every beat; specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve erased histories—tightens when the poison label converts rumor into tactile evidence. One meaningful deepening: the shift from random collection to deliberate witness of Dr. Thorne’s true story. Agency is archival, not physical, but the choice to keep walking into the fog forecloses reclaiming his own name. Cost is felt in the ache of damp cold and the endless ebb he embraces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: erasure is countered by sensory fidelity. The aconite sketch reweights “dangerous beauty” from scandal to reverent agency. Final image of fog as “possibility” offers non-literal answer—memory work is infinite, not redemptive. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unspoken cost of perpetual anonymity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the keeper’s synesthetic filter; cranes “punctuate,” wind carries “fragmented sentences.” Rhythm swells and subsides like the tide, mirroring accretive structure. No head-hopping; diction remains within the wanderer’s self-taught lexicon. Compression (“He was their keeper”) lands as earned epigram, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is tidal—long rolling clauses break into fragment crests. Metaphors stay coherent: “steel cliffs,” “bruised dawn,” each image tethered to port physics. Zero paraphrase loops; every line adds pattern or sensory grain. One near-purple moment—“sorrow too vast for words”—is forgiven because it is immediately undercut by the tactile sketch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Port-archive of erased lives feels fresh; the keeper’s synesthetic archaeology is a perspective I haven’t seen. Aconite label as keystone flips noir poison trope into tender historiography. Risky accumulative structure pays off in the final foghorn note that reconfigures all prior fragments. Slight deduction for echo of “nameless man” trope, though here it is functional.</comment>
