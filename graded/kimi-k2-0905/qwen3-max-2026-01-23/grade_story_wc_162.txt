<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s featherly resolve is embodied through tactile micro-choices (tracing grain, closing logbook), but the interior contradiction promised by “lost child” never surfaces in scene; the epiphany is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “thresholds feel sacred precisely because of the necessary distances” reweights the logbook and maze legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (weather code → diversion → maze → absence → insight) holds; orientation is swift; the single reflective block is anchored to bench-touch and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Crystalline terrace, oak bench, and spiral grain function as micro-setting that constrains attention and supplies the final image; prism light charging the wood spiral is selective, tactile, and mirrored in internal state. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Elara’s trained eye; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understand sacred thresholds—tightens once when prism light reveals spiral grain, forcing recognition of “necessary distance.” No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates via pattern recognition; cost is the irreversible absence of the mother reframed as sacred distance, felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from grain-path / maze-path / flight-path parallels; final reweighting of absence as sacred distance avoids moralizing. Subtext resides in silent hush and mirrored spirals; emotional aftereffect is concrete—tear becomes blessing without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—wood whorls as flight paths, weather code as life metaphor—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long reflective sentences breathe, then tighten into crystalline final line. No register drift; prism light and “fractured hush” are voice-motivated coinages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or insight. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned (fractured hush, featherly resolve) and paid off. Occasional elevated lyricism stays within Elara’s trained gaze, never purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of aviation logbook, corn-maze architecture, and sacred-distance philosophy feels fresh and specific to this voice. The butterfly-effect aftermath is reframed as spatial theology rather than trite time-travel trope. Risk lies in lyric compression; coherence holds.</comment>
