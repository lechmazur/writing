<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and body-anchored; the parasol tip as tactile anchor works. Shift from suicidal curiosity to communal belonging is legible, but the final beat still leans on abstract summation (“peace,” “solace”) rather than a single irrevocable act that locks the change. Cost is felt yet not crystallized in an on-page forfeiture. Voice stays coherent; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: cadence of ice, net, wind, and breath layers until the closing image reweights “ending” as continuation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara’s renunciation of immediate death is legible, the price is the postponed clinic and the dawn-wait, shown in the porcelain bud glint. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; one soft transition (bunkhouse→skiff) is legible. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active grater of wood and bone; the parasol tip micro-setting constrains her grip choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Arctic urgency—sound of ice groan, hemp fibres, aurora shimmer—each filtered through Elara’s altered attention. Final image reuses the porcelain rosebud under green light, recharging it as compass, not relic. Spatial choreography across skiff, nets, fireside remains clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep the appointment?—tightens once when the net yields Lars’s father journal; knowledge that “ice remembers” reframes her own ending sound. Escalation is accretive: each sensory fold (patience, net, fireside) narrows isolation until belonging becomes the live option. Cost is opportunity: she forecloses tonight’s exit; price is legible but soft. No reversal beyond the single deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns—ice groan, parasol tip, wind song—so “ending” is re-priced as communal breath, not void. Avoids explicit thesis; final sentence offers Conceptual Repricing rather than moral. Subtext resides in Lars’s grief-shadowed whisper and shared stove-warmth. Emotional aftereffect lingers as quiet endurance rather than cathartic epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Elara’s perceptual skew: “grip on reality… like holding smoke.” Syntax lengthens under calmer folds, fragments when nets surface. No dialogue beyond two whispered lines—sufficient, subtext-laden. Voice remains distinct; no register drift; aurora-as-green-shimmer stays within Arctic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breath-sentences and clipped haul-shorts, mirroring net pull. No loops or scaffold; “windborne solace” is repeated with purpose, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent—ice as memory vault, parasol tip as compass. One mixed image: “fold in patience” is abstract, but anchored immediately in net-haul physicality, so clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Euthanasia-tourist trope is inverted: Arctic outpost chosen for legal death becomes stage for life-continuity. Fresh angle—disaster-relief netting as therapy—gives pragmatic texture. Ice-memory metaphor is familiar, yet woven through local journal fragment rather than lecturer speech. Overall synthesis feels particular, not checklist; risk is quiet, not gimmick.</comment>
