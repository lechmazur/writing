<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical patience and the decisive shift to guardianship are grounded in clear micro-choices (kneeling, re-burying), but the swing from “disprove everything” to “protect the lie” is stated more than embodied; a single tremor of visible hesitation or sensory recoil would have made the cost bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: discovery of box → reassembly → knowledge → renunciation, each because/therefore link visible. Closure is an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: she literally re-buries the truth, vines hiding the site. One minor causality stutter: the titanium latch is “brittle with age” yet opens without tool or struggle—an unaccounted blip, not fatal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Radiation suit hiss vs. orchard calm, ochre storm beyond invisible boundary, dew untouched by fallout—selective sensory triads anchor the stillpoint rule without cataloguing. The moss-patch depression guides her next action, so environment constrains choice. Micro-flaw: no tactile cue from the diamond itself at the end; orchard stays visually steady but could have sharpened the final image with one resonant sensory echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—truth vs. survival of sanctuary—tightens once the letters reveal the benevolent hoax. Agency crystallizes when she reburies the archive; on-page cost is the surrender of her lifelong identity as debunker. Pressure plate is solitary, no external antagonist, sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: the value of necessary illusion vs. corrosive truth. Subtext reframes “curse” as shield without speechifying. Final apple-drop image reweights premise—knowledge is replanted, not paraded. One soft line—“comfortable lie endured”—nears thesis-statement but is saved by immediate burial gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara, perceptual signature filtered through skeptic’s cataloguing eye: “sharply observant,” “methodical patience.” Syntax is controlled, lightly elevated but within a scientist’s lexicon; no head-hopping. One rhythm hiccup: triple adjective clusters (“fruit-laden apple trees, an impossible calm”) verge on drumbeat yet serve the hush contrast. Dialogue absent, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, image, radiation data—scaffolding minimal. Metaphors stay consistent (storm, stillpoint) and physics holds. Only loop: “comfortable lie” repeated twice within forty words near midpoint; trims easily. Otherwise propulsion clean, no filter-verb stacks; final line lands quietly without syntactic drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-apple oasis is familiar trope, but inversion of debunker-as-guardian-of-myth gives fresh torque; diamond as frequency regulator not MacGuffin but geobiological tool adds specificity. Stillpoint concept synthesizes geology + mysticism without hand-waving. Risk level moderate—no formal experimentation—but internal concept reframing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
