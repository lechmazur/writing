<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction and embodied cost—her “lovingly venomous” touch shows poison-as-nurture in one gesture. Motivation remains ancient-debt simple, but the micro-choice to pour her last essence into the Heartwood is earned and irreversible. Flaw: no second voice on stage limits relationship crucible; still, the single-POV arc is tight and credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms, Elias lives, and she dissolves—cost is the total erasure of her form. Causal chain (bead → resonance → bloom → cure) is lucid under Accumulative/Textural lens. One shard, no orientation debt; the deepening cadence at “wave of light cascaded” reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glasshouse, silverbark, venom-thorn, shadow-rose—each detail is filtered through ghost-perception and guides tactile action. The bead functions as micro-setting that constrains every resonance beat. Winter-cracked fields evolve from frozen hush to melting sigh, mirroring internal thaw; spatial choreography stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Elias via orchard awakening—is signaled in first 120 words. Single tightening at Heartwood: she trades her last flicker for bloom, foreclosing survival. Pressure is accumulative; each resonance beat heightens spectral drain, cost visible in “form dissolving.” No reversals needed; the endurance itself narrows options to one final note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as love-as-toxin-as-cure, never sermonized. The bead’s return in roots reprises centuries-old betrayal with transformed meaning—Conceptual Repricing achieved. Final image of “orchard thriving” offers non-literal answer: devotion outlives death. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the lovingly venomous paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, frost-bitten diction—“starless dome,” “ashen-veil,” “resonant song”—maintains ghost POV without head-hop. Compression taught early (“cumulative: 28”) and paid off in rhythmic cadence at bloom crescendo. Syntax mirrors spectral flicker: long clauses collapse into single-note fragment at climax. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world rule. Occasional modifier stacks (“profound hush of winter-cracked fields”) flirt with purple but stay in ghost register. No paraphrase loops; beat-level propulsion clean. One mixed metaphor—“lovingly venomous caress infused with chill of grave yet nurturing spark”—survives because it encodes core paradox.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ghost-orchard resonance is fresh synthesis; trope of spectral redemption is tilted through alchemical botany and sonic key. Specificity of bead-as-memory-storage and venom-as-life-spark prevents generic swap. Risk in lyric elision taught by numeric shards pays off in closure cadence. No close echoes to famous ghost bride arcs; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
