<comment>Elara’s vocation and empathy are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—polishing the brass weight, matching language to gear fatigue—so her decisive turn feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the cost to her is implied rather than embodied in a final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the re-ignited valley chorus reweights isolation into connection while the warm weight in her pocket keeps the price tangible. Causal chain is clean—dislodged weight → silence → linguistic repair → restored talks—held under a lyrical-accumulative lens. No orientation drift; stakes tighten exactly once when the flood-scarred elevator risks permanent silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Clock-tower micro-setting constrains every move: gear teeth dictate posture, rosewater scent marks ritual, star-beam spotlights responding silos. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s musical ear—brass timbre, vowel resonance—so environment and body fuse. The final projected beam across valley functions as expanded setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—valley silence versus communal voice—tightens when the Cherokee elevator’s hesitation threatens permanent fracture; Elara’s linguistic gamble forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: she finishes weary, pockets the once-cold now-warm weight as persistent reminder of fragility. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of polyphonic empathy emerges solely through juxtaposed languages and re-animated silo voices; no character moralizes. Final image of “vigorous tender chaos” reconfigures earlier isolation without tidy maxim. Complexity is honored: even the cracked foundation remains, now scaffolded by communal timber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s musical perception, diction waxing vowel-rich under calm, compressing to metallic clang during gear strain. Pattern of linguistic names is taught early and paid off in closure cadence. No POV leakage; every metaphor is filtered through her choral ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with task: long liquid sentences for Arabic vowels, clipped Anglo-Saxon bursts for gear catches. No scaffold or synonym loops; each image does dual duty (rosewater cleanses and perfumes, beeswax seals and honors). Only hairline slip: “vigorous tender” repeated twice, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of horological repair with multilingual resurrection of talking grain silos is sui generis; trope of broken clock becomes fresh conduit for communal linguistics. Risk of magical-realist mechanic pays off because brass weight’s re-attachment carries tactile credibility and social cost. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
