<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile grief and rhythmic memory practice are vivid and embodied; the contradiction between passive monitoring and active remembering is dramatized in her fingertips. The moment she reclassifies tapping as cartography (“not mourning… cartography for the intangible”) crystallizes a visible cost—her prior grief-work was mislabeled. Interiority stays concrete, but one slip into diagnostic summary (“she existed in a state of drifting moored”) slightly blunts the contradiction under peak pressure. Still, the final renunciation of witness-as-mourner to witness-as-mapper is earned and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the AI overlays the torn atlas with living routes, rewriting the premise that submersion was primary. The biometric key causally ties young Elara’s encoded rhythm to the present reveal; no retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (suit joints, viewport moon, station skeleton). One soft patch: the phrase “the rhythm was the path” edges toward thematic echo, but it is immediately reweighted by the tangible console tap that follows, keeping cost legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recycled-polymer station, salt-stiffened suit, and torn paper atlas are handled, not catalogued; each constrains action—salt jams joints, paper edge cuts thumb, console surface receives taps. The moon’s periodically eternal reflection on water is recharged in the final line as silent partner, mirroring the now-internalized map. Spatial choreography holds as Elara moves from viewport to console; no floating rooms. Missing smell of decaying reef keeps it from 9+, but tactile specificity is strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—tightens when ecological silence is revealed as the true eraser, not mere submersion. The midpoint micro-turn (AI overlay swapping land for life-routes) escalates pressure by reframing her life’s work from cataloguing loss to decoding silence. Cost is visible: the station’s purpose pivots in real time, her grief retroactively misaimed. No false cliffhanger; the final tap series forecloses passive monitoring and commits her to sonic cartography.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shift from drowned villages to silenced cues: extinction deletes navigational memory before land vanishes. The atlas page torn in 1978 acquires ironic charge—paper outlives the living guides it once depicted. Final image of moonlit sea “holding its breath” while internal symphony plays offers resonant, non-moral answer: remembrance is a tide, not a tomb. No sermonizing; the insight is earned by patterned taps that reassemble absence into sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—syntax mirrors her percussive thinking with clipped fragments and drum-like cadences. No head-hop; the younger self on video is external data, not interior intrusion. Register stays within a field-scientist lexicon; “biometric key” and “nutrient flows” feel like words she would use. Occasional elevated lyric (“periodically eternal promise”) is justified by moon-gaze habit and reframed productively at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high—each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One mixed metaphor cluster (“deep-water current” + “tapestry” + “symphony”) appears mid-scene but does not touch the closure beat. No loops or filter-verb stacks; the tapping verbs drive motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rhythmic-memory-as-archive concept feels fresh: eco-data stored in body percussion rather than cloud servers. Torn 1978 atlas page repurposed as biometric key transforms nostalgic prop into functional plot device. Risk of ecological-sentimentality is resisted by foregrounding silence-over-submersion causality. Synthesis is specific to this voice; swap coral for any other ecosystem and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
