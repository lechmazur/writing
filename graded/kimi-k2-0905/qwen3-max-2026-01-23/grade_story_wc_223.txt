<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—performance vs. preservation—animates every step; the benevolently ruthless trait is dramatized when she “gently but firmly” extracts others’ pain without pause. Embodied emotion is steady (“her boots silent on cracked stone”) and the final renunciation—placing the pawnless board—pays the cost of never again using trauma as mere material. The nomadic penumbra remain shadows, not crucible, so relationship pressure is thin; still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible. Closure earns stasis with felt price: she forfeits personal comfort to carry witness forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the spelled words pattern is taught by 25% and cadence intensifies until the final “remember” reweights the board’s emptiness into choral presence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, skeletal streets, post-crisis now). Closure is a Charged Poise: the living chorus reconfigures the emptiness as fertile ground with undeniable social cost—she must keep walking, silence gone. One transition (street → gallery) is legible; no causal break; cost is the lifelong burden of witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic curve actively enables the unbinding ritual—sound clings and returns, constraining her method. Micro-setting includes the chessboard whose empty squares “scream,” a tactile relic that charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (fractured light, dust as stars) filters through Elara’s archivist attention. Spatial choreography is clean: west arch → circuits → plinth; distances hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting private trauma into collective memory—tightens each time a new word is spelled, narrowing her option to stop. Benevolent ruthlessness creates internal friction that escalates cost: she must keep extracting even when it wounds. One deepening: the shift from solitary witness to vessels in the penumbra, foreclosing her anonymity. Price is legible—she forfeits rest and assumes perpetual custodianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via accreted gestures: absence becomes fertile, history resides in small kindnesses, not crowns. The chessboard’s vacant squares re-acquire voice through the gallery’s return, a non-literal answer that reweights loss as seedbed. No moralizing; the final warmth is felt, not asserted. Counter-reading persists: her archive may still consume her, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—geometry, fractured light, archival hunger. Syntax lengthens and contracts with circuit pacing; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“sacred geometry,” “varnished truth”). No dialogue, so voice contamination is nil. Patterned repetition of spelled words is taught early and paid off, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors ritual footfall; sentence variety high, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“dust motes like scattered stars” appears once, no clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed risk: “benevolently ruthless” is abstract, but the next clause dramatizes it, so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crisis-actor-turned-witness is fresh; combining choreographed spelling with acoustic archive feels inevitable in hindsight. The pawnless board repurposes a game of war into a memorial of civilian gestures—specific synthesis. Risk in lyric ritualism is balanced by concrete micro-stories. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
