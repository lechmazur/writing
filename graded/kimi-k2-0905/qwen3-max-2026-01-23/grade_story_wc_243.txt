<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied; the silver locket warmed by “skin and sorrow” shows emotion through object rather than label. Her contradictory impulses—clinging vs. releasing—coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. The micro-choice to press the locket into the damp paper crystallizes values and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gust + salt mist + ink impression visibly reconfigure grief into “seed packet of continuing joy,” cost unmistakable. Method (“proximate causes”) anchors every beat; no teleporting props. Orientation complete by line 4; single shard, one tightening, causal lens held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the blooming jetty’s salt mist literally kisses the fresh ink, altering the covenant’s fate. Sensory hierarchy obeys archivist attention—porcelain cup, lavender steam—constraining ritual pace. Spatial choreography clean; body, tool, and weather converge on the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release sorrow while preserving small moments—tightens once via the handwritten covenant; option to keep grief “as stones” is foreclosed by the wind-seal act. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, appropriate under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legible in the shifted chest-weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation: freezing a moment becomes the way to let it keep growing. No moral stated; final “seed packet” image reweights locket from anchor to bloom source. Particularity of two mugs’ steam vs. abstract “grief” keeps wisdom earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—ink “rich brown of earth and enduring promises” is her idiom, not authorial flourish. Pattern-taught elision (“steep it precisely three minutes”) mirrors archivist precision without breaking coherence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under “haunted euphoria” peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences lengthen during ritual, shorten at wind-gust climax. No loops or scaffold; “gently thorough” used once, justified by character trait. One mixed metaphor (“waterfall of pale blossoms”) but cleared by closure beat clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Concept of botanical archive as grief technology feels fresh; jetty blooming at twilight reverses usual memento mori. Risk in quiet ritual payoff succeeds because final sensory confluence reconfigures stakes. Could swap names but not the specific covenant mechanics without breaking logic.</comment>
