<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is repeatedly dramatized—cross-referencing logs, kneeling to sketch shadows, whispering translations—so the final choice feels inevitable. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse quickened,” “tears welled”) without therapy-speak. One contradiction beat is missing: she never doubts or weighs risk, so the climb feels friction-free. Still, the orb-restoration moment carries visible cost in solitude-turned-embrace, earning credible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb’s re-ignition reconfigures her identity from apprentice to “keeper of light” with felt cost of inherited solitude. Causal chain holds: starling shadows → cipher → phrasebook key → orb → engines. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“antique airship *Whispering Atlas* hung suspended…”). No teleporting props; hopscotch glyphs are pre-seeded. One minor elasticity: the deck compartment opens on the first try with no prior failure beat, but the emotional win overshadows the convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Airship body, phrasebook, and dusty hopscotch board function as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices. Selective sensory triage—slack silk, brass tarnish, starling wingbeats—filters through cartographer priorities. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves corridor → observatory → deck → bridge. The final orb-slotting image recharges earlier “stranded luminance,” meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Only the starling aerial scale drifts toward picturesque, not tactical, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the ship’s stranded light—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each cross-referenced pattern tightens possibility until only the 7-3-1 sequence remains. The decisive micro-turn is the finger-press that forecloses further search; cost is the solitude she must now carry as keeper. Coincidence (starlings happen to land in code) is introduced early and therefore allowed to complicate, not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-through-attention emerges from concrete acts—reading children’s chalk, polyglot marginalia, starling glyphs—never from exposition. Final notation “Discovery lies in reading the quiet maps…” is character-level summation, not authorial moral, so no Echo penalty. Ambiguity lingers: the ship’s future journeys are open, but her apprenticeship is foreclosed. Resonance is charged by the orb’s literal glow refracting through “stranded luminance” metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Free-indirect diction—“silken balloons slack,” “living tapestry”—stays within a map-apprentice’s perceptual lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for drift, staccato for click-of-compartment. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Distinct syntactic signature—compound sensual nouns, nautical verbs—differentiates the piece from generic antique-airship pastiche.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: 730 words with high multi-tasking lines (“amber light bled… living tapestry”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk (“sea of clouds,” “tapestry of synchronized motion”) is kept coherent by persistent sky-weaving motif. One density spike—“brass fittings tarnished and silk balloons slack, a majestic relic embodying stranded luminance both literal and metaphorical”—is earned as establishing compression. Final line varies rhythm, closing on forward motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines starling murmuration cryptography with hopscotch divination—an angle not seen in steampunk archives. The polyglot’s dog-eared verse acts as both talisman and cipher key, transforming a generic phrasebook into plot-bearing object. Risk is high—avian semaphore could read twee—but specificity of shadow-square sequence grounds it. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no template echo.</comment>
