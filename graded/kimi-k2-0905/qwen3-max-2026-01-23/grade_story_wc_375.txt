<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s gifted recall and charcoal-stained hands are vividly embodied; the decision to sketch on calcite is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc. The final beat—pocketing the new charcoal—shows a credible, earned shift from paralysis to renewed vocation. Lily remains off-page; no relationship crucible required. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave reveals Lily’s note, permanently reweighting Elara’s vocation. The broken-lock-as-key setup is foreshadowed by Lily’s childhood “3-1-4” etching, satisfying causality. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Single continuous scene, 780-word scope fits Track A.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Calcite panel and auroral crystals function as micro-setting: their glow literally powers the reveal of the combination, constraining Elara’s method. Sensory detail is selective (damp stone taste, charcoal grit) and filtered through an artist’s eye. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent. Cave description is woven through action, not static catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rectify creative exile—tightens when the empty chest fails, then narrows further to the single calcite canvas. Agency: she decides to sketch, triggering the crystalline response that exposes the numbers. Cost is felt: the act reopens grief yet simultaneously ends her exile. Escalation is accumulative density rather than causal reversal, fully valid under inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as living memorial, grief as renewable fuel. Lily’s note reconfigures the meaning of every prior charcoal mark—an earned, non-literal answer. No moralizing or echo. Subtext resides in the glowing numbers, the lock shard, and the untouched fresh charcoal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is painterly (contour recall, auroral light values). Rhythm swells intentionally toward the luminous reveal, then exhales with quiet hope. No dialogue, so nonevaluated. Free indirect thought is clean; diction stays within artistic lexicon. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“phantom limb,” “alchemized hope”)—never clogs the high-pressure reveal. Information density high: single clauses carry memory, gesture, and setting. No scaffolding, no filter-verb stacks. Closure line is crisp, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mnemonic hyperthymesia meets subterranean lithic screen. The lock-as-key inversion feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative premise penalty; cave-portrait trope is transformed through mnemonic science and maternal grief. Risk in lyric escalation is rewarded because closure stays legible.</comment>
