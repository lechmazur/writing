<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’ contradictory impulse—seeking freedom yet descending into confinement—anchors interiority; the grandfather motive is concrete, but the leap from “witness” to risking drowning feels slightly under-motivated. Embodied panic (knuckles, breath) is sharp, yet the final beat of serene renunciation arrives without an on-page micro-choice showing him override survival instinct. Still, the hierarchy of values (remembrance > life) is legible and costs erasure/life-risk, satisfying the 9− test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: gold fleck → console → phase array → message, each step tightening options; the tide supplies a hard external clock. Closure is Earned Stasis: he refuses to save the codex, pays with its loss, and the frozen star image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation rock-solid by 60 words; no teleport or amnesia. Minor quibble: “crystallize invisible cable data into light” is accepted speculative rule, not explained until late, but pattern is taught before payoff, so lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Facility breathes through salt, drip, frost—each sensory note filtered by Aris’ spelunker eye and tied to tidal stakes. The Phase Array is not just scenery; its brass contact and frost-growth literally constrain the final successful alignment, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Meets 9− gate: tool (array) + micro-setting (contact patch) directly shape the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“deliver witness before tide erases all”—is signaled early; each downward meter narrows escape margin, tightening pressure. Protagonist agency drives every beat: he turns the valve, stays to read, chooses to leave codex. Cost is legible: loss of relic + near-drowning. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal needed. Could edge 8.8 if a mid-scene complication (tool freeze, jammed door) had forced extra tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance vs. entropy emerges via concrete pattern: cables carry “whispers,” ocean carries everything away; the frozen star crystallizes that tension without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (hand on codex, final release). Final image reweights earlier “crashing hush” from void to vessel of memory—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Avoids tidy maxim; ambiguity (will anyone else see the beacon?) lingers. One clause flirts with echo—“I stand by the unremembered” repeated verbatim in message—but earns pass as grandfather’s own words closing the circuit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Aris’ sensorium; perceptual signature crisp (“concrete throat,” “serpent of claustrophobia”). Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed prepositional chains during descent, then shorter clauses in escape. No head-hop; diction stays within geologist-adjacent lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic control almost reaches 9, but one template cadence (“Water dripped… / The crashing hush…”) repeats without taught pattern, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: noun + strong verb dominate; adjectives rationed. Figurative layer (“cathedral of forgotten science”) is earned and brief, never clogging cryo-beat. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-stack. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths visually mirror descent/ascent. Copy clean; only typo-scan “illuminant” used consistently. Closure sentence unmarred. Meets 9− threshold with microscopic waiver on the single cadence echo noted in Q6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical phase-transition with undersea cable data-recovery feels fresh; premise is more than gimmick, reframes “listening” as literal crystallization. Grandson completing erased grandfather’s circuit is familiar emotional arc, but rendered through specific tech and tidal clock that could not swap into another tale. Risk in lyric compression pays off. Not quite 9 because core emotional pivot (witness > sanctuary) treads known ground, albeit with new instrumentation.</comment>
