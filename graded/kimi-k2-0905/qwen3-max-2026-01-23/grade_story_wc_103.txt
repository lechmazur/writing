<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-riven obsession is palpable in embodied micro-gestures (tracing the “nearly blank photograph,” the ivy-tightening chest). The retrocognitive trap is shown, not labeled, and her surrender to the garden’s geometry feels inevitable. One minor slip: “quaking reverie” edges toward diagnostic self-tag at climax, blunting the pure embodied beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photographs stabilize, time becomes habitable, and the cost is the irrevocable loss of the fragment and of Aris’s last frozen touch. Hyperbolic geometry is seeded early (“recursive folds,” “whispers traveling hours”), paid off when the halo unspools along geodesics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; pattern taught by 25 % and reweights the stake at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The living bridges, dew, obsidian pond, and mossy altar are not backdrop—they are the machine that bends time. Every sensory pick is filtered through Elara’s designer eye and used to guide the final placement of the fragment. Environment directly constrains the ritual; without the curvature peak at the nexus, the release fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation from retrocognitive prison—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the fragment begins to unspool, foreclosing the option to keep Aris’s moment intact. Escalation is textural: fading photos → ghost tactile presence → permanent tapestry; each layer reweights the cost of letting go. No external antagonist needed; the garden’s own geometry supplies the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of texture—velvet moss, cool mist, willow bark—until time itself is redefined as tactile forgiveness. Final image (“she’d spend her days dancing with time”) offers non-literal, charged poise without moralizing. One soft echo: “texture of time” is spoken aloud by Aris; the line is earned, but its explicitness keeps the score just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s synesthetic perception; diction (“supple willow,” “crystalline streams”) remains within her horticultural lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as the fragment disintegrates, mirroring the spiral geodesics. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; psychic distance compresses exactly when pressure peaks.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template stems or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor (ivy tightening, willow warp) recurs to reinforce time-as-organic. One near-miss: “sigh of release” is a mild auditory cliché, yet it passes because the garden literally exhales through leaves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Hyperbolic hedge-maze as time-engine is fresh, and the fusion of horticulture with non-Euclidean geometry feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The halo fragment’s dissolution into geodesic light-threads reprises the premise without late rule changes. Risky lyric compression pays off: the story could not survive replacement of any core image.</comment>
