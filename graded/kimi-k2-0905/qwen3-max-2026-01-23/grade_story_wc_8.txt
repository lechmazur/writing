<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “emotionally rational” trait is shown through calm parallel-drawing rather than eruptive feeling, but interiority stays abstract (“felt the precise moment,” “heart swelled”) without bodily contradiction; the vow is clear, the micro-choice (reading aloud, ribboning the letter) is present, and the cost (loss of comforting myth) is legibly felt, so the arc is earned if not viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the station shifts from tomb to sanctuary once the letter’s truth is voiced; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—ivy density and historical parallels reweight meaning rather than cause external change; cost is legible in the final image of “lighter satchel, clearer conscience,” satisfying the 9+ quick test; orientation is swift and the single shard holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-choked architecture is tactile and specific—moss-softened bench, frozen clock, amber light—while the letter’s gold-leaf vines echo the living ivy, charging the final image; environment constrains action (bench as altar, ivy as witness) and mirrors internal release, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring truth—tightens once the letter is read aloud: the comforting myth is foreclosed, stakes shift from secrecy to communal clarity; escalation is textural (ivy sigh, sunlight break) rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens; price is the loss of protective narrative, visible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through parallels rather than thesis: noble lies corrode even when kindly meant; the ending image of ivy covering “a chapter made whole” reweights the opening petal fall into renewal; no moralizing line intrudes, preserving subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Aris’s historian idiom—precise analogies, measured cadence, no head-hop; diction (“conceptual repricing,” “Veridian Peace Accords”) fits scholarly POV; rhythm modulates from dense reflection to final luminous release, remaining distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“emotionally rational to the end”) flirts with label-speak but occurs post-closure; no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality; minor scaffold in repeated “parallel” phrasing keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar trope—ancestor’s confession letter—gains freshness through historian’s non-confrontational method of parallel-drawing rather than exposé; ivy-as-manuscript metaphor is organic; risk is modest but execution is specific and memorable.</comment>
