<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses on the page—shame vs. open heart, discernment vs. warmth—each micro-choice (boxing the tail, sketching the latch) embodies the tension. Embodied emotion is acute: the “cold stone” breath-steals, shoulders physically unlock. The renunciation at 274-“guardian and healer were two wings” lands only after causal sequence of shedding beats, paying visible cost of fear and self-doubt. Voice never slips into therapy-speak; even abstract realizations stay moored to tactile workshop world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure effect is a crystallized Charged Poise: the corded box becomes an “earned talisman” whose weight forecloses naïve trust yet keeps the heart open—felt cost is the lifetime vigilance she now accepts. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each ‘shed’ layer intensifies interior density and reweights the stake until the final alloy is “flexible, resilient.” Orientation anchored by 38 words—who, where, when all pinned by sensory cues. One transition (doorway → stars → bench) is legible; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, hearth glow, and lavender scent braid through every beat, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the scarred oak bench, hidden latch sketch) constrains the reconstruction action in real time. Spatial choreography is clean: body → terrarium → doorway → bench track is impossible to mis-map. Final star image recharges earlier nebula comparison, tightening the cosmic framing around her synthesis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—balance compassion with self-protection—signaled at 110 and tightens through each shedding beat, culminating in the workshop redesign that costs her open-door ease. Agency is interior but visible: spoken words, visualization, and the physical latch sketch each foreclose prior openness. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational/internal yet coherent and escalating. Cost is legible: eternal vigilance replaces unconditional welcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chameleon’s tail—sacrifice for survival—refracted through Elara’s regeneration of trust. No thesis stated; meaning accrues via object, action, and starlight. Final image of “shimmering stillness” offers a non-literal answer: vigilance and compassion coexist like dawn mist dissolving into solid daylight. Ambiguity lingers—future betrayals remain possible—but stance is reweighted, satisfying CR criteria.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance, sliding seamlessly into free indirect when she whispers self-exoneration. Syntax grows leaner under pressure—short monosyllabic releases after cascading clauses—mimicking shedding rhythm. Diction stays within a healer’s lexicon—“remedies, talisman, regenerate”—never drifts into academic register. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Elara’s sensorium throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate yet varied; sentence length contracts in the shedding beats to propel momentum. Figurative language is selective—silver mist, cold stone, nebula birth—each image pays off in closure loop. No mixed metaphors, no template cadence runs. Minor hedge “quietly vivid” appears twice but serves as deliberate motif, not scaffold, and is thereby exempt from artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar betrayal-recovery arc is refreshed through chameleon autotomy metaphor made materially central. Specificity of wildlife-handler expertise grounds the piece; generic professions would collapse the beats. Reconstruction via “shedding layers” subverts typical armoring trope, choosing vulnerable refinement over hardened shell. While emotional arc is universal, tactile workshop detail and cosmic close-up create memorable fusion.</comment>
