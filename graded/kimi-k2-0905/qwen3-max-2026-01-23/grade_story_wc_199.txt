<comment>Elara’s interiority is lush, tactile, and consistent—seed-sorting fingers, “mossy delight,” grandmother’s laughter by the hearth. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. sacred search) coexist in-scene, not in summary. Final endurance/renunciation—accepting custodianship without external reward—carries visible cost as the moonstone dissolves; causality intact. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion carries every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of leaf → monument → light reweights stakes each cycle. Closure is Charged Poise: final leaf aloft crystallizes her eternal stance with undeniable cost (“serene gratitude” + dissolved moonstone). Orientation anchored by 3rd sentence; no teleporting props. One minor tighten: “moonstone cabochon dust speck” repeated verbatim twice could compress, but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Arbor-as-micro-setting constrains every move: seeds drift, moss receives monuments, moonstone reacts only here. Body, tool (twig-prod), and recurring leaf charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—gray-green light, cool parchment leaf, scent of old paper. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode leaf-messages to keep memory alive. Pressure tightens once: silver-veined hand-leaf arrives, foreclosing passive cataloging. Cost visible—moonstone lost forever, her lap empty yet palms open. Agency is attention/renunciation, not victory; suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated ritual: remembrance plants tomorrow’s forest. No overt thesis; final image reweights earlier monuments without moral. Subtext in silence—no child appears, yet future reader implied. Avoids “mossy delight” echo as crutch; motif accrues meaning each return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature sustained: syntactic parallelism mirrors seed-sorting rhythm; diction stays within arboreal lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression taught early (“thimble-sized cairn… lattice of frost-kissed twigs”) and paid off in final leaf-catch. Register never drifts into academic; “mossy delight” reads as idiosyncratic devotion, not tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence rises/falls with leaf spirals; sentence length varies. No loops, no synonym churn. Information-dense lines (“moonstone cabochon dust speck” packs four nouns yet scans). One micro-clip: “micro library carved from softened bark” could trim “softened” without loss. Metaphors internally coherent (leaf = clasped hand, veined like parchment). Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: seed sorter + skyborne arbor + micro monument ritual feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk in quiet ending—no antagonist, no twist—yet stakes stay intimate and earned. Folklore (star-weaver) is localized, not generic European. Transformation test fails if Elara is swapped with any archivist; specificity is high.</comment>
