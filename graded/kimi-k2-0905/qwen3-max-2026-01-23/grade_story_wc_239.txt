<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is consistently textured—"the weight of solitude, the love for what was lost"—and her micro-choice to speak "I am" crystallizes her arc. The final smile is earned, but earlier beats lean on abstract motive ("quiet necessity") rather than embodied contradiction, so the arc feels more luminous than lacerating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cumulative/Textural lens: each spiral lap layers a lexical fracture → repair → silence, tightening semantic stakes until the blank "existence" page forces the climactic re-pricing. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the witness becomes speaker, paying with the solitude of sole authorship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystalline arches, star-dusted periphery, and the softcover dictionary itself supply micro-setting that constrains every step; the spiraling ramp literally channels her gait and gaze. Sensory triage—frayed ink, guttering candle-letters—mirrors cognitive fray, anchoring abstraction in tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save meaning from eternal falsification—ramps via each lexical wobble; "hope/despair → resignation" is the sharpest tightening, forcing her to coin "yearning." Cost is conceptual but legible: she exits as eternal custodian, path foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: language is preserved not by discovery but by declarative speech-act. The blank "existence" page reweights earlier stable words, offering quiet irony—meaning is authored, not found—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—"the silence itself a tangible presence"—and modulates rhythm to spiral ascent. No head-hop; diction slightly over-elevates ("wanderingly exact precision") but remains internally consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—stage, metaphor, pressure. Occasional cadence repetition ("walking out… journeying inward") is pattern-taught and pays off, so no loop penalty; closure image is crystal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>"Spiral arbitration" as semantic CPR feels fresh; the lexicographic apocalypse reframes cosmic stakes into epistemic ones. Risk is structural yet coherent, turning a dictionary into an ark of meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
