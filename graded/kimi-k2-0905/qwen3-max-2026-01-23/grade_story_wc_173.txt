<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—frost on temples, swaying torso—while her chastity reads as disciplined resistance, not absence. The contradictory pull between lullaby surrender and thread-untangling agency is dramatized in gesture, not label. Micro-choices (which strand, which knot) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible sweat-cost. The only minor drag: “her chastity was not denial, but dedication” nudges toward abstraction mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each untangled thread layers density until the sanctuary’s breath-release reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—prismatic sparks hang like promise, social cost undeniable. Orientation is taught by lyric pattern; disorientation serves the final charged poise. Persistent constraint: once threads are liberated, Elara’s exhausted stance forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow, and crystalline dodecahedron are not backdrop but tools—proximity dictates which thread can be touched, cold suppresses sound to isolate breath-timing. The prism’s facets mirror Elara’s bodily sway, literally guiding her choreography. Micro-setting (the central knot of gold/obsidian) functions as the final boss, constraining finger placement and heart rate. Every environmental detail is re-accessed under starlight to charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate silenced voices—tightens when each untangling forecloses a future of forgetting. One meaningful deepening: the foundational lie knot fuses collective memory and coercion; severing it narrows Elara’s physical option (hands tremble, sweat freezes). Cost is visible: frost on skin, mental syrup, final exhaustion. No reversal, but accumulative pressure crystallizes into the resonant release of echoes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as insurgent seeds, conformity as anaesthetic lullaby. Subtext lives in gesture—untangling = political restoration, not metaphoric decoration. Final image of luminous seeds drifting into slumbering consciousness offers Charged Poise that reweights prior threads. Minor abstraction in “unkillable seed of remembrance” keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly attached to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“syrupy wave,” “crushed pearls”) is consistent with sensory overload under starlight. Rhythms lengthen during knot-work, fragment at breath-edge, mirroring cardiac tempo. No head-hopping; prism’s hum remains external phenomena interpreted through her body. Voice modulates from cool description to compressed urgency without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence texture varies: long braid-like clauses for knot-work, staccato fragments at sparks-release. No synonym loops; “threads,” “strands,” “filaments” each carry distinct tactile load. One mixed metaphor risk—“time-threads coiled like serpents of captured starlight”—but physical logic holds because starlight is earlier established as tangible filament. Information density high; each sentence advances either choreography or memory politics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of courtesan + chastity + memory insurgency is non-obvious and specific to this world. Thread-untangling as insurgent method grows organically from dodecahedral sanctuary premise; no trope checklist. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when final sparks literalize the metaphor. If relocated to another city, the entire emotional machinery collapses—proof of inseparability.</comment>
