<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior life is sonically rich (“her fingers tracing…humming a resonant song”), but her contradictory impulses are announced (“identity peacefully migrating…a contradiction that deepened her resilience”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The waxing-crescent cue is concrete, yet no scene-bound choice is narrowed by it; the smelting ritual succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or risk to her stance. Because the beat is largely observational, the motivational engine feels static rather than escalating toward an earned renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“perpetual present where yesterday’s echoes swirled…”) and held to the lyrical image-reprise close; orientation is clear by the 120-word mark. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance phrase (“Though my name fades…”) crystallizes options without paying an on-page price, so the cost is felt conceptually rather than tactically. The sequence risks and-then pacing (“She set…She held…She placed…”), but each deposit of smelted light layers density toward the final cadence and satisfies the tightening requirement under the lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wintersun, bronze gears, brine-scented air, and the cool bamboo creel are filtered through Elara’s ritual attention, anchoring scene geography without cataloging. The tidal bench, watermark line, and moon-silk shelves evolve physically as water recedes, so the environment tracks cleanly. No prop teleports; however, the gears remain backdrop only—never constraining her smelting choice—so the 9-band gate is missed by a hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stake is signaled as “preserve wonder in routine,” but no live option threatens that wonder; therefore escalation is purely atmospheric, not tactical. The single meaningful deepening occurs when shards fuse, yet Elara’s agency is acceptance rather than risk—pressure plateaus rather than narrows. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies lyrically, satisfying minimum tightening, but the absence of felt cost keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of paradox-as-wholeness emerges concretely through the smelting mechanic; no final moral is stated—the last image (“seed…star reignited”) re-weights earlier desert/memory fragments. Subtext stays in gesture (tear of awe, creel reset) rather than commentary, achieving resonance without abstraction. The idea migrates from premise to closure cleanly, meriting strong marks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a mid-distance that matches ritual solemnity; diction (“titan-gear,” “salt and sun,” “luminous fragments”) is consistent and rhythmic. Purposeful repetition (“She…She…She…”) teaches its liturgical cadence early; no POV leakage occurs. Voice modulates subtly from hush to hush-plus-wonder, but stays within one register—slight ceiling before 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is steady, sentences vary in length and opening, and density is high (“emptiness holds space for stars”). One paraphrase loop (“gleaming under the gentle gold / wintersun that promised warmth without heat”) is minor; no mixed metaphors intrude. No artifact obscures closure; prose control is strong though not virtuosic enough for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mythic time-library and identity-smelting combine into a fresh angle on memory-versus-oblivion; the bamboo creel as migratory-soul catcher is specific, not borrowed. Conceptual risk (no antagonist, pure lyric) is committed to fully and paid off. The synthesis feels inevitable, but emotional stakes remain gentle, capping originality just below top decile.</comment>
