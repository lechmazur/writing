<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Enlil’s monastic frugality and twenty-year patience are vivid, but interiority slips into abstractions (“covenant with the unknown”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels unearned because no prior flaw or doubt is dramatized on-page. Micro-choices are limited to lamp-oil drips and tile rotation—precise, yet never complicated by error, fatigue, or temptation, so the cost is intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: tile alignment triggers star-chart reveal, reconfiguring Enlil’s life from isolation to covenant. Causal chain is thin—no intermediate obstacles or failed attempts—so the turn feels pre-ordained rather than risk-laden, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the final image carries conceptual cost (“frugal act now reverence”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Palace suspended “between regimes” and cedar-table micro-setting anchor early; dust-scented night, glazed-brick constellations, and lamp-oil drops are filtered through astronomer’s gaze. The tile’s grooves and luminescence constrain the final alignment, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled—“seal a covenant with the unknown”—but pressure plateaus: no failed alignments, ticking clock, or external threat complicates the attempt. The single tightening is the final rotation; because no prior option is foreclosed, escalation is more mood-deepening than option-narrowing. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—rigor as gateway to reverence—emerges through tile and star-chart synthesis rather than statement. Final “seek with sincerity is to be found” skirts platitude, but is saved by the empirically ironic frame. Subtext of skeptic-turned-believer is coherent, though softened by absence of dramatized doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Enlil’s perceptual filter—numerals, oil drops, azimuth—creating a precise, slightly archaic cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under final alignment. Phrases like “dusky harmony” risk poetic inflation, but pattern holds. Voice is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; imagery is selective, not overwrought. Occasional loftiness (“mathematical prayer to the cosmos”) edges toward abstraction, but never loops or stalls momentum. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fusion of magic square, Babylonian astronomy, and empirical irony feels fresh; avoids stock mysticism by grounding revelation in schematic labor. Conceptual risk—math as spiritual conduit—is fully committed to. While “lonely scholar decodes cosmic truth” is familiar, the tile-as-star-chart twist and frugal lens provide specific inflection.</comment>
