<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—clock-oil-stained fingers, trembling precision—and her contradictory longing/renunciation pulses in-scene. The tuning-fork gesture externalizes her split desire; the tear is earned. Micro-choice (leaving the fork) visibly forecloses return. Cost is scaled to length; still, “excruciatingly gentle” italicizes self-awareness twice, nudging therapeutic label territory.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: droplet cadence → crystalline resonance → earned reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Central crystal constrains final gesture; fork’s vibration is the decisive physical act that reweights her life’s work. Closure line “complete, resilient song” lands conceptual cost. One micro-turn (shame → acceptance) is cleanly embedded.</comment>

<comment>Quartz forecourt is not backdrop but instrument: droplets become audible chorus that physically answers her fork. Petrichor threads nostalgic memory, later re-scented as healing. Body-as-setting (trembling fingers, breath catching) ties clock-precision to musical pulse. Final gilding of wet crystals charges fork-offering image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem abandoned dream—signaled paragraph 1. Pressure escalates via density: hush thickens, droplets accumulate, regret sharpens. Single tightening: fork-on-crystal act forces recognition that clocks were always her symphony; option to keep dreaming literally dropped from hand. Cost visible in tear and permanent offering; no external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—art transplanted, not betrayed—emerges through fork/crystal duet rather than statement. Micro-motif of “excruciatingly gentle” recurs, culminating in softened regret, reweighting earlier shame. No moralizing; final “resilient song” is imagistic, non-literal. Subtle counter-reading: acceptance could be self-soothing illusion, adding ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clock-scribe precision colors every notice—“infinitesimal taps,” “latent frequency.” Rhythm modulates—from long petrichor sentences to staccato droplet taps—mirroring internal shift. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Free-indirect stays within lexicon of artisan-musician. Final image cadence slows into benediction without syntactic syrup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work—e.g., “droplets fell with infinitesimal taps, creating a whispering chorus felt more than heard.” No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (frozen memory, glacial hush) stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes at climax. “Excruciatingly gentle” repeated twice is deliberate pattern, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar healing-pilgrimage arc is re-cast via micro-craft world: clock scribe + resonant quartz = fresh angle. Tuning fork as both musical and metronomic device fuses disciplines. Risk: lyric repetition could cloy, yet payoff crystallizes. Specificity of fork’s latent frequency vs. crystal lattice feels verifiable, not gimmick. Transformation test fails if ported unchanged.</comment>
