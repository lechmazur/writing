<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s infinite patience is dramatized through the slow footfall ritual and the refusal to rush; the cost is her silence absorbed into the stones, a credible renunciation. Interiority is sparse but embodied in tactile rhythm, never label-speak. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails; cap 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s heartbeat restored, Elara’s footsteps silenced—cost is her erasure as agent. Accumulative lens holds: each footstep adds density until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Dissonance snap is on-page, felt in bones; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archway, tuning fork, and cobblestones function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—moss retreats “like respectful shadows.” Environment evolves with each step; final image is charged by the same stones that once diagnosed collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore shared balance before collapse”—is signaled early and tightened through each footfall that forecloses the alternative of haste. Cost is legible: Elara surrenders her audible presence. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory revived through intentional rhythm emerges from pattern, not宣言. Final image of the hush as “vessel, full of listening” reweights the opening void without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; ambiguity lingers about what the town will do with its second breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptual filter: “wind held its breath,” “moss retreated.” Syntax mirrors patient cadence; no head-hopping. Patterned elision (“wild hush”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct rhythmic signature under pressure—no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or rhythm. Figurative language is sparse, never muddled. High information density—“translucent figures shimmered…before fading like gentle breath”—compresses entire resurrection into one line. No artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tuning-fork-plus-footfall as CPR for communal memory. Ghost-town revival trope is transformed through sonic archaeology rather than nostalgic haunting. Risk taken with almost no dialogue sustains lyric tension. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
