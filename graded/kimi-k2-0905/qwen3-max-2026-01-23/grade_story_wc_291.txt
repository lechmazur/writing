<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s synesthetic attention to texture-souls is vivid, but her “methodical” trait is announced rather than dramatized in micro-choices; the interior contradiction between seeking empathy while guarding her own solitude is hinted but not crystallized on the page. The final tears feel inevitable yet the causal cost is more atmospheric than embodied. Still, the specificity of her fingertip reading and the refusal to chase faces create a memorable, non-generic protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ribbon pressed to stone reconfigures both Clara’s fate and Elara’s mission with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each discovery (groove → carving → journal) is triggered by Elara’s tactile agency; no teleporting props. The “evidence vanished six months ago” line supplies off-page backstory yet the present beat chain stays coherent and orients early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Quarry as micro-setting delivers: the submerged ledge and moss-draped machinery constrain how Elara can kneel, pry, and reveal; the final gilding sunrise reweights the tomb into cradle. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—texture > vision—and the ribbon’s silk vs. limestone polarity is tactile rather than symbolic. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“awaken dormant empathy”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the journal’s private letter forecloses the possibility that Clara was abducted; the cost is the town’s collective grief re-opened. Escalation is accretive: each tactile discovery adds density until the ribbon-stone fusion forces Elara to carry a new, volatile story home. No fake reversals; luck complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the fusion of fragility & permanence is lived first through Clara’s stone-carved mask, then through Elara’s decision to pair silk and stone for public reckoning. The final image reweights “disappearance” into chosen exile, letting empathy breathe without moralizing. No thesis sentences; the journal’s voice is particular, not aphoristic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent—“her pulse stilled,” “a choked breath escaped her”—and diction stays within an artist’s tactile lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for quarry vastness, staccato for flint cuts. No head-hopping; POV distance holds. The lyric cadence of “furrowed hush” is taught early and reprised at exit without self-echo fatigue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“lanced the moss away—a precise, piercing motion” does double duty (tool + metaphor) without purple overflow. No synonym loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated. Final line burns off mist with monosyllabic punch that recharges earlier “pearl and ash” palette.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist + cold-case quarry is a fresh synthesis; the limitation becomes the investigative superpower. Clara’s stone self-portrait avoids the expected corpse reveal, opting for self-authored absence that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric quarry meditation could have slid into pastoral cliché, but the tactile flint action grounds it.</comment>
