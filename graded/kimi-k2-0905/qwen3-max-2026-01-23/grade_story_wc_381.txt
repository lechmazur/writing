<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—“quiet urgency,” “tranquil blaze”—but her contradictions never collide in a single micro-choice; she glides rather than struggles. The final exhalation is beautiful yet foregone, so the cost feels aesthetic, not personal. Still, the voice-specific perception and anchored memory of the mentor’s wing keep her above stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the wing dissolves into light, the prophecy unravels, and the haven’s silence is permanently re-priced. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence deepens from whispered dread to smoothed hush, the cost legible in the vanished wing and the enduring guardianship she must now carry alone. Causality stays internal and lyrical—perfectly valid—yet the piece risks one soft miracle too many when “visible, silvery ripples” heal the fracture without any stated price to Elara’s body or future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The brook, moss, and star-dusted sky are filtered through Elara’s synesthetic ritual—“auditory fabric,” “valley between chirps”—so setting doubles as spell map. Spatial anchors are immediate and tactile; the crane’s wing grounds the micro-setting in hand-warm paper that later becomes star-motes. Environment never constrains her physically, but it supplies the acoustic topology she must mend, so the final image of sunrise on water is earned rather than pasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence the coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when the fracture stings her with “moon bleeds / earth forgets.” Escalation is textural: each mapped silence thickens the pattern until the exhalation ruptures it. The cost is real (wing lost, guardianship assumed) yet stays conceptual; a sharper bodily or social price would push this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as listening-as-repair: prophecy’s fear is neutralized not by counter-violence but by compassionate attention. The crane-wing’s lifecycle—from almanac page to dissolving light—quietly reweights knowledge as stewardship rather than control. No moral is stated; the final “liquid hope” invites reflection on how silence can be engineered yet never owned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; diction stays within Elara’s arcane yet intimate register—“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”—without drifting into purple. Rhythm swells and subsides with the brook, sentence length modulating from long tide-like clauses to the final short cadence of dawn. Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive enough to carry the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is high: information-dense, little scaffold, metaphors stay physical (“syllables dissolving like salt”). Occasional poetic堆叠—“quiet brook singing a liquid lullaby”—teeters on excess but serves the spell-casting mode. No loops or filter stacks; final image is crisp, propulsive, and unpunctuated by clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The “mapping silence” conceit is fresh and organically integrated; it turns acoustics into cartography without exposition dumps. Familiar tropes—lunar prophecy, paper familiar—are re-threaded through sensory cartography and compassionate counter-magic. Risk is moderate: the piece leans on lyric inevitability rather than surprise, but the specificity of the origami-wing-as-tool keeps it from feeling templated.</comment>
