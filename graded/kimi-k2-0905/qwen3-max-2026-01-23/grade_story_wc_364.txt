<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s “quietly determined” resolve is shown only once, at the climax; the rest is summary. No contradictory interior impulse is dramatized in-scene, so interiority is flat until the final beat. The sacrifice of his wife’s laughter is told, not felt in body, muting emotional cost. Still, the micro-choice to pour spirit into the silk is embodied and stakes a visible path, earning a modest arc of strength.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arches’ hum reweights meaning and the cost (lost laughter) is implied in the final azure dawn. Causal chain holds—silicon ➜ roots ➜ arches—though the magic mechanism is off-stage. Orientation is clean by word 120; location, time, and POV remain stable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the silk ignites, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, root-pierced cavern, dew-kissed blossom—each is concrete and filtered through Kael’s smith-notions of stone and ore. The orchard planet rules are learned through action, never dumped. Final image of arches casting azure shadows directly recharges the stake and charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography inside the mine is flawless; picks, lantern, stones tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the grove—signaled early; escalation is one smooth rising curve as silk pulse travels upward. Agency is ritual, not tactical; Kael’s only decision is to begin the rite, so pressure feels external rather than option-narrowing. Cost is present but abstract (lost memory) and not re-felt at climax. Still, the tightening beat of ignition visibly changes the world, satisfying basic escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience through sacrifice—emerges via image chain: rubble ➜ roots ➜ blossom, never sermonized. Subtext resides in silence: Kael’s quiet smile replaces spoken epiphany, avoiding thematic echo. Final azure shadow is a non-literal answer that reweights prior rubble. The insight is implicit but slightly generic; specificity of the apple blossom saves it from platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is soot-and-ore, anvil-weighted syntax. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under earth-weight, then uplifted longer sentences as arches rejoin sky. Diction remains within a blacksmith’s ken; “azure” is the one poetic lift, justified by the world’s light. Voice distinctiveness is the strongest category.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong density: single sentences handle atmosphere, motion, and metaphor simultaneously. No mixed metaphors; azure light stays consistent. Minor template cadence in three successive “his [verb]” lines inside the cavern (−0.2). No loops or scaffold in closure zone. Opening and final lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Overall read-aloud rhythm is controlled, elevating this above median.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Floating orchard planet + bartered memories is a fresh synth, not a trope retread. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual over action—yet coherence holds. Specificity of smith-hand detail keeps it from generic eco-fantasy. Still, the core mechanic (star-silk reboots geology) is familiar magic-tech; originality is incremental, not seismic.</comment>
