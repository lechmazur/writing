<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mischief against communal grief—drives every beat: ink-stained fingers clutching verse while elders preach, her micro-choice to speak at the spire forecloses silence and costs her exile-risk. Embodied emotion (“tears cutting paths through dust”) anchors moral stakes in bodies. Final renunciation of singularity is earned by prior refracting acts and carries visible social cost when Borin amends the ritual.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ritual is reopened to polyphony, undeniable conceptual cost—community must now shoulder collective complicity. Causal chain holds: because Elara refracts truth, elders narrow options to inclusive forgiveness; therefore monolithic blame collapses. Lens is Causal, taught by “because/therefore” echoes and held to final image. Cost is legible in Borin’s thickened voice and the spire revealed as blank canvas.</comment>

<comment>Canyon acoustics and bone towers actively weaponize Elara’s whispers into amplified counter-liturgy; geography constrains tactics and charges closure when echoes weave polyphonic tapestry. Mist-wreathed spire evolves from blame-monument to blank canvas, reweighting meaning. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: artist notices pearlescent vapor, tactile vertebrae, ink on skin. Spatial choreography clean; crowd shift from rigid to softened tracked through audible breath.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will single truth prevail—tightens when Elder Borin confronts; Elara’s refract or silence becomes irreversible stance. One meaningful escalation: community’s rigid anger softens into shared complicity after second stanza, narrowing options to plural forgiveness. Cost visible in stonemason’s tears and Borin’s conceded amendment. Agency is Elara’s public recital that forces collective reframing; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges refracted: forgiveness demands full spectrum, not erasure. Subtext lives in canyon echoes that return softened phrases, dramatizing shift from blame to empathy. No moral sermon; final image of woven poems offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity accepted when Borin concedes “unity built on half-truth is a second collapse,” embedding moral ambiguity in ritual change.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric sustains artist’s perceptual signature—ink, blueprint tears, pearlescent mist—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors refraction: parallel anaphora (“Recall…”) and echoing fragments. Diction stays within POV lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm accelerates with stanza delivery, breathes during Borin’s pause, crystallizes in final polyphonic chant.</comment>

<comment>Sentences multi-task: “the canyon caught the line, echoing…” propels sound, stakes, theme. Metaphors precise—bone towers as petrified prayers—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each echo iteration reweights meaning. Final paragraph varies paragraph length to cadence ritual beginning. No scaffold, no synonym churn; opening line anchors voice and stakes.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ossuary canyon as public tribunal feels fresh; bone-spire altar flipped from blame relic to plural canvas. Refacting truth via acoustical poetry is non-obvious synthesis of artist-mythic genres. Ritual amended rather than overturned, avoiding familiar rebellion arc. Specificity of noon bread with stray dog humanizes Architect without cliché.</comment>
