<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “creeping normality noticer” vocation is vividly embodied through sensory memory and micro-choices; the pocket crust anchors her interiority and shapes her decision to plant. The contradiction between grief and hope is played out in gesture rather than label, and her final choice to embrace resilience is earned through the shared bread beat. Interiority stays concrete, though the moment of absolution is slightly over-articulated (“understood then: the sacred lived…”), edging toward epiphany-speak. Still, the embodied arc and visible cost lift it above competent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bread reprise crystallizes meaning and reweights the crust from relic to compass with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—recipe found → bread baked → shared → crust repurposed—each step contingent on prior beats. Orientation anchors early; the single ivy-to-courtyard transition is legible. One minor loop: “tenuous absolution” is restated four times without deepening; trims 0.2. Otherwise lens (Accumulative/Textural) and cost hold to final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivy-choked statues, moss-softened stone, and sleeping sparrows are filtered through Elara’s loss-attuned eye; every detail mirrors internal erosion. The courtyard functions as micro-setting: the straw she spreads and the soil she uncloaks directly constrain her tactic of planting. Sensory hierarchy favors smell and touch—yeast, steam, moss—creating lived-in immediacy. Spatial choreography stays clean; fountain-bench-ivy triangulation never drifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory be converted into living hope without erasing loss?—is signaled in first third and tightened when Madame Lin presents the duplicate loaf, forcing Elara to decide whether to keep or share the relic. Pressure is textural: each seed placed reweights the crust’s meaning; no external antagonist needed. One credible loss: she gives away the last physical trace of the bakery, foreclosing hoarding as option. Cost is visible but not yet painful enough for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—sacredness reclaimed through communal tending—emerges via bread-seed-courtyard triad rather than thesis line. The final reprise of steam warming palms reconfigures the opening “hollows where warmth once lived” without moralizing. Subtext in Madame Lin’s silent offering carries shared grief and consent to hope. One near-miss: late articulation of “quiet revolution” edges slogan, but image of straw-covered seedlings keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—smell-first, color-second, sound-last—creating a distinct noticing signature. Syntax lengthens during gardening to mimic deliberate kneading, then shortens at bread break to match breath. No head-hop; Madame Lin’s interior is accessed only through gesture and gaze. One clause drifts into editorial register (“a testament to nature’s gentle reclamation”) but is absorbed by surrounding sensory density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: crust/steam/seed triad performs triple duty every paragraph. Rhythm modulates from languid ivy sentences to staccato seed list without drumbeat. Mixed-metaphor vigilance clean—no vehicle collisions. One small scaffold: “quiet argument against despair written in seeds” is abstract summary adjacent to concrete action; trims 0.2. Otherwise ear-test reads aloud smoothly and closure line lands crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening as liturgical practice feels fresh; the bakery-resurrection via found recipe avoids nostalgia trap by keeping focus on shared eater rather than product. Risk is moderate—quiet activism in ruined palace—but stakes stay personal, avoiding sermon. The synthesis of seed, bread, and memory is particular to Elara’s gaze; swap her out and the ritual collapses. One echo: “steam like a blessing” nears cliché, but immediate tactile follow-through redeems it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Early signal frames expectation; micro-choices of noticing yeast absence and pocketing crust shape tactics. Two beats: deciding to plant seeds instead of mourn, and breaking the new loaf. Closure linkage: her final certainty (“her work mattered”) issues directly from noticing green defiance she earlier predicted. Cost is communal sharing of last relic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crust appears first paragraph, re-enters as tactile anchor mid-gardening, transforms into compass at end. Cannot be swapped—its specific scent and steam echo the vanished bakery, enabling the absolution beat. Shared consumption in final beat reweights meaning from private grief to communal resilience.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Concept named repeatedly but only becomes causal when bread sharing forecloses hoarding; prior beats treat it as thematic echo. Still, the final choice bears visible emotional cost, lifting it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Trait visible in slow soil uncloaking and seed placement; contrasted with potential violence of tearing ivy. One cost: extra time spent kneeling in cold extends physical exposure, grounding “gentle” in consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uncloaking soil is the literal first action that enables planting; without it no seeds enter ground. Returns symbolically when she uncloaks the loaf cloth. Action is non-swappable driver of midpoint and mirror of ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Method named and demonstrated across planting scene; mechanics of straw cover and seed choice affect survival odds. Supplies ideological frame (“quiet insurgency”) that charges final image of green defiance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting supplies forgotten soil and hidden status that allows illicit planting; marble proximity dictates gentle tool use. Final bloom potential is contingent on courtyard shelter. Description is vivid but could be replaced by another derelict garden with minor edits, capping high-end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Autumn chill noted but never narrows choices or creates ticking urgency; functions as atmospheric garnish rather than clock. No reference to frost deadline or seed window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation stated early and dramatized when steam from cup and bread cue epiphany. Conflict visible in hesitation to share relic; sacred/ordinary tension resolves through communal eating. Still leans on declaration more than cost.</comment>
