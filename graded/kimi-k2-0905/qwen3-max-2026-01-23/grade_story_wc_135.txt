<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s exile-grief and reactively-visionary gift are embodied in salt-stung shawl, calloused thumb, the micro-choice to oil the valve; contradictory impulses—fear of vision vs hunger to repair—drive each beat. Final renunciation (trumpet as healing signal, not fanfare) is earned by the prior cleansing labor and costs her the nostalgic sound she craves. Interiority avoids label-speak; “phantom chill of that silenced sound” is concrete, contradictory, particular. Only cap keeps it from 9: second-character pressure (Elder Lin) is brief, status shift light; still, protagonist alone carries sufficient crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ivory stones now bear “returning feet and new stories,” a legible before/after reweighting with visible communal cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment-display tightens the tapestry, cadence shifts at sunset trumpet note, then again at child’s drawing promise. Orientation anchored within 120 words; transitions across seven shards are legible via recurrent trumpet/image pattern. No causality break; persistent constraint—her involuntary visionary pain—shapes every tactic and final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivory-quarried stones, salt-damp air, and seized brass threads are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly constrain the valve-restoration action. Micro-setting (the valve itself) becomes crucible that charges final image. Weather transition from ceased rain to evening breeze tracks elapsed time and mirrors communal thaw. Spatial choreography clean across pier, archive, market square; no white-room syndrome. Meets 9+ gate: environment (stone pier) literally holds “imprints of returning feet,” altering future choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal memory without being consumed by visions—signaled early. Each staggered revelation (chart, log, shanty) deepens density, narrows Elara’s energy reserve; visionary seizures exact visceral cost on-page (“gasped, stumbling back”). No coincidences; escalation is Accumulative deepening that forces her shift from private archive to public pier performance. Price visible: she permanently trades private nostalgia for communal beacon, ending with “next interval” promise that forecloses rest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—healing through curated absence—emerges from valve’s missing sound, torn pages, and Elara’s refusal to erase hollows. Final image of child’s drawing reweights earlier fragments as open-ended process, not recovery. Subtext in Elder Lin’s “you do not erase the hollow spaces” invites ambiguity about whether archives ever suffice. No moralizing; resonance earned via concrete intervals. Slight softness keeps it sub-9: chart/shanty beats risk thematic echo rather than fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elara’s salt-archivist perception: “salt-damp air clinging to her woolen shawl.” Diction—“verdigris,” “linseed oil,” “leaded window”—stays within her restoration lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for slow cleansing, staccato for vision fracture. No head-hopping; Elder Lin’s insight filtered through her reception. Distinctive syntactic signature (oceanic cadence, compound clauses) sustained without monotony. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “water-bloated ledgers with critical pages torn away” packs three jobs in five words. No synonym churn, loops, or scaffold. Metaphors organic—“sound hung…like a fulfilled promise”—and internally consistent. One mixed metaphor risk: “emotional geography” versus “contours of what was lost” is salvaged by immediate embodiment. Final line propels: “promise of the next interval” snaps cadence forward. Artifact-free in closure third; eligible for 9 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: reactively-visionary archivist who can *only* access truth through absence, paired with staggered-interval healing protocol, upends standard reunion tropes. Trumpet valve as silenced memory-bone feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in seven-shard mosaic pays off via taught pattern (trumpet → chart → song) and coherent closure. Could edge 9+ with sharper ethical tension (e.g., someone demanding faster truth). Still, specific lived detail resists transplant to another port.</comment>
