<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, methodical drive is embodied in every micro-gesture; the moment she flips the stamp to its blank end and presses the Deep-Singer sigil, her interior contradiction—obedience to archival protocol vs allegiance to buried truth—crystallizes with visible cost. The beat earns its emotional weight because her earlier sensory attention (paper weave, watermark glow) has already made the reader complicit in the discovery. No stock labels, no safety-hedging; her competence is balanced by the solitary risk she accepts. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost is intellectual rather than bodily or relational, slightly softening the final punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: blackout → silence → hypothesis → stamp test → palimpsest reveal → deliberate counter-impression. Each because/therefore linkage narrows her options until the final act of reclamation is the only ethical path left. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s “reclaimed stillness” is re-weighted from passive hush to active witness, and the glowing dual stamp carries permanent conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens ambiguity at any point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken library is not backdrop but instrument: salt-thick air warps vellum, anemone light angles reveal hidden watermarks, mother-of-pearl serpents guide footfall toward the vault. Every sensory note is filtered through Elara’s indexer priorities—fiber weave, ink chemistry, marginalia—so setting constrains her tactical choices. The final blank-end press of the stamp is charged because the coral-seagrass watermark has already fused environment and evidence. Micro-setting (the lectern stone, the lectern’s angle to light) directly enables the climax; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore erased indigenous voice—tightens the instant the watermark contradicts the Charter’s origin myth. One meaningful escalation: discovery of the spiral-shell indentation forces her to abandon the planned authentication and instead imprint the suppressed sigil, foreclosing any future denial she might claim. Cost is legible: she permanently marks the archive with evidence of its own lie, an act that could end her career. Under causal lens, agency drives every ratchet; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of archival violence emerges organically from the palimpsest reveal; no character lectures us on colonial erasure. The dappled light motif migrates from decorative to moral witness, reconfiguring stillness from neutrality to complicity. Final image—ink glowing beside both sigils—offers a wordless indictment of curated myth. Complexity remains: Elara neither topples the system nor saves the Deep-Singers; she simply re-opens the wound, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bandwidth; diction (“logical page indexer,” “fiber weave,” “quill-key-wave”) belongs to her professional idiom. Rhythm lengthens during calm observation, compresses into single-clause beats at the stamp flip. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is active, every metaphor anchored in her tactile world. Voice is distinct enough to survive the blackout reboot at the end without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. “Dappled resolve” recurs but accrues new semantic weight each time, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally consistent—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line can layer sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy archive-heist trope is inverted: no theft, no chase, just a scholar weaponizing her own tool against its intended purpose. The leviathan-bone stamp’s double face feels inevitable, not gimmicky, because the story commits fully to the logic of archival ink bonding only to pre-Submersion paper. Specificity of watermark chemistry and spiral-shell sigil roots the premise in tactile reality. Risk—quiet subversion rather than spectacle—pays off in lingering conceptual aftershock.</comment>
