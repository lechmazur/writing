<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s quiet-fire motive and historically-attuned perception drive every beat; the micro-choice to hand Hemlock the lens crystallizes her agency and seeds the communal turn. Interiority stays concrete—opera-glass weight, scent of maple-sap bread—without diagnostic self-talk. The final “E” loaf she accepts carries visible cost: she shifts from observer to participant, forfeiting detached safety. Only the elders’ grief is summarized; a single embodied beat of their resistance would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<comment>Causal linkage holds: because Elara reframes the art through the silver-leaf carving, therefore the ovens relight and the ritual restarts—an on-page decisive change with communal cost (forfeiture of honey-centric purity). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“hidden city behind the monumental waterfall”); no debt applied. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the community re-embraces an altered custom, foreclosing the path of nostalgic perfection. Persistent constraint—the absence of honey—shapes the final bittersweet flavour, meeting the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Waterfall thunder, moss-slick paths, and oven-cold stone are filtered through Elara’s curator gaze; every sensory note pressures choice (climb for herbs, relight ovens). The emerald lens itself functions as micro-setting, re-weighting carved meaning and charging the final image when bread steam mingles with mist. Spatial choreography is immaculate: no impossible positions across the harvest-to-bake sequence. One notch from 9 only because the grotto’s larger social architecture (dwellings, circulation) remains silhouetted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—revive or lose the bread custom—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the silver-leaf discovery reframes “broken” as “adaptable.” The meaningful turn occurs at the carving reveal: knowledge narrows options from mournful停滞 to risky improvisation. Cost is visceral—bitter herb, maple stand-in, elders’ tear-tracked consent—felt on the tongue in the final bite. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates a second time, keeping this just below 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: culture is a seed that germinates through distortion, not relic-worship. The silver-leaf’s bitter note and the “E” loaf reweight the carving refrain—“the leaf remembers”—into a lived future. Subtext resides in gesture: Hemlock’s tear tracks dust, children cradle dough like promises. Final image of shared bittersweet bread offers Conceptual Repricing: displacement is not erased but metabolized. No thematic echo penalties; the single aphorism is spoken in-character, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s curator perception; syntax lengthens with cataloguing gaze, shortens under urgency (“We gather the herb. We bake tonight”). Diction—“rosewater dread,” “protective hymn”—is POV-plausible, not purple. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Hemlock’s rasp against Elara’s calm curator cadence. One micro drift: “cloudy eyes widening” borders on external omniscience, but context keeps it legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling from misty observation to kinetic harvest (“People climbed moss-slick paths…”). No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—waterfall as veil, bread as vow—without mixed collisions. One near-overwrite: “healing incantation” skirts cliché, but the next clause grounds it in scent, averting penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of museum optics, displaced-person grief, and adaptive botany feels specific and inevitable; removal of any pillar collapses the arc. The opera-glass reframing of a carving—not a honeycomb—provides a non-obvious pivot that rewrites oral history on the page. Risk: lyrical compression could have slid into preciousness, yet bitterness of silver-leaf and absence of beekeeper keep stakes earthy. Fresh inflection scores the bonus; not quite 9.5 only because the communal-bake resolution is a known motif, albeit re-rooted.</comment>
