<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s guarded silence vs. irrepressible laugh embodies live contradiction; the accidental-prophecy flaw is dramatized in-scene (one snort → storm) and costs him solitude. Micro-steering choices embody “quiet fire” motive and hierarchy of values—control over comfort. Final renunciation of recognition (“no headline”) is earned, visible, poignant. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, though secondary pressure is minimal due to solo cast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: laugh causes storm → steering beam calms it → dawn forged; one cycle, one tightening. Anchors (who, where, stakes) appear by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: storm integrated, path foreclosed, cost is eternal anonymity—felt in “no headline” line. Persistent constraint (prophetic laugh) shapes every future ascent and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystalline lighthouse, obsidian wick, and star-coordinates constrain every steering decision; environment literally channels the beam. Sensory hierarchy favors wind, glass temperature, vertigo—filtered through Kael’s storm-herald priorities. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, lantern room, cliff) remains consistent and affects movement choices. Micro-setting (glass shard) becomes the lever that calms waves—passes 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape dawn from chaos—signaled early; pressure escalates the moment laugh births storm. One meaningful tightening: storm forces Kael to convert rage into glyphs under time-pressure of rising wind. Cost is legible: sweat-salt, warming shard, lifelong silence required. Agency stays internal (minute tilts of wick) yet alters external sea-state—earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: art transforms catastrophe into grace through disciplined ritual. No explicit moral; final sand-glyphs silently reweight earlier “ancient shadows.” Image of fisherman feeling calm without knowing why gives concrete aftereffect. Avoids sentimentality; ambiguity (solitude as price) lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors angles, refraction, star-maps—precise to Kael’s vocation. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for ascent, clipped clauses for steering beats. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Purposeful lyrical compression (“emerald lighthouse drank the starlight”) taught early and paid off at dawn—legible under causal lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: single sentences fuse motion, tool, and sensory data. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors in closure zone—meets 9+ hygiene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: meteorological lighthouse optics + curse-of-mirth gives new angle on “storm-keeper.” Total-internal-reflection steering is specific, visually precise, and story-specific. Premise isn’t derivative template; risk (quiet ending, no antagonist) heightens solitude theme without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names change—details are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: laugh heralds storm beat 1. Development: forces guarded silence throughout ascent. Payoff: final smile acknowledges cost of vocation—closure charged. Constrains tactics and reweights ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Introduced as handled object; warms under use, guides every steering micro-choice; reappears in dawn-lit sand glyphs. Mechanics of total internal reflection narrated and crucial to resolving storm. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Routine framed in paragraph 2; shapes stakes (“unchanged since last newspaper”). Each tilt of wick is ritualized; calm outcome proves routine efficacious. Final descent repeats pattern—routine now shadow-charged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Trait triggers inciting storm, enforces lifelong silence, reconfigures future options. Visible cost: isolation, vigilance against mirth. Drives every high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Verb “steer” titles action sequence; every tactical micro-tilt calms waves and integrates storm. Without steering, no dawn possible—causal spine of plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Method named early; geometry governs beam paths and glyph creation. Failure to maintain reflection would negate storm-taming—mechanics matter mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting supplies height, optic range, isolation; emerald facets focus beam. Lighthouse is stage and tool combined; final sunlit stone reprises opening image, charged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Post-newspaper epoch sets nostalgic tone and motivates Kael’s analog ritual. Not a live clock, but primes scarcity of tangible artifacts and heightens value of shadows.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Desire declared paragraph 3; internal conflict (hope vs. solitude) embodied through guarded laugh and final smile. Dawn shaped on-page—motive fulfilled at visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Shadowed elation” seeded early; modulates from tense vigilance to fulfilled solitude. Final smile crystallizes tone, merges joy and loneliness—charges closure image.</comment>
