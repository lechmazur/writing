<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the donor-heart beat anchors every micro-choice. The shift from “collect stories” to “create space” is credible, but the moment of irrevocable renunciation is softly voiced rather than dramatized under pressure, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-trail density builds to chromatic flash that reweights Elara’s craft. Closure is a Charged Poise—she descends with new purpose and persistent constraint (dyes must now practice “iridescent caution”). Cost is legible in the vow itself; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating tea-house, cedar bench, and sun-carved grooves are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the wing’s scale-architecture. Micro-setting (bench, wing, beam) constrains the only action—waiting for light—so environment actively shapes tactics. Minor drift into postcard valley vista keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why stories cling—tightens when the wing’s flash reframes the question into “how to host stories.” Single deepening suffices for lyric length; cost is the lifelong discipline of restraint now bound to her dyes. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent attention vs. impatience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image chain: dull-brown wing → sky-burst → dye philosophy. Final line—“become a surface worthy of reflection”—offers resonant, non-moral answer. No explanatory summation; ambiguity lingers on what “worthy” entails, inviting reread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic attention: sun is “liquid-gold,” heartbeat “foreign rhythm.” Rhythm swells then subsides with light pulse; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; compression (“quietly explosive”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty (image, emotion, craft rule). One scaffold loop: “steady, foreign rhythm within her ribs” echoed twice in 50 words. No mixed metaphors; figurative language thins exactly when flash occurs, giving the image room. Minor ear-wobble keeps it under 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Donor-heart as narrative compass and morpho wing as craft revelation synthesize fresh angle on “artist learns to listen.” Premise avoids transplant cliché by making organ a tuning fork rather than guilt device. Could use sharper cultural specificity of dye craft to push past 8.5.</comment>
