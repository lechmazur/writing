<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—uncovering why certain voices haunt the canyon—drives every step; her sensory acuity is shown, not told, and the final act of song is a credible renunciation with embodied cost. Interior contradiction is light (no visible self-interests collide), and the single-POV keeps pressure personal. The earned release lands because her earlier listening skills foreshadow her power to un-knot echoes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the song reweights the canyon from prison to sanctuary; the cooling shell is an unmistakable on-page cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each shell whisper deepens pattern until the cadence shift releases tension. Orientation is anchored within 80 words; transitions are invisible because the piece is one continuous scene; no causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is rendered through Elara’s proprioceptive walk—stone ribs, starlight glints, solstice monolith—each detail doubles as emotional barometer. Micro-setting (the shell in her palm) constrains the next datum she can act on. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating objects. Setting evolves from oppressive to exhaled, mirroring closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped echoes—tightens with each shell disclosure; the third whisper forces physical movement to the monolith, narrowing options. Cost is atmospheric rather than corporeal: the shell’s silence and her tear-streaked cheeks show price paid. Agency is continuous attention/interpretation; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete triad: love, greed, shame—never sermonized. Final image (sanctuary rather than prison) reweights earlier “web of intrigue” from entrapment to interconnected compassion. Reed-blown melancholy saturates every paragraph, modulating into release without sentimental uplift. No meta-commentary; meaning stays in the echo imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains lyric distance while retaining sensorial immediacy. Syntax lengthens during listening beats, shortens during disclosures—rhythmic control mirrors breath of canyon. No filter-verb stacks; perception verbs are character-specific (“detected,” “recalled”). Register stays within Elara’s poetic but ground-level diction. Shell whispers use italics sparingly, teaching pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image + motion + emotional valence. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors (“reed-blown melancholy,” “stone ribs”) remain consistent. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets. Micro-movements (“footsteps silent on ancient stone”) serve spatial anchoring, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of folk-ghost story with geologic lyric feels fresh; echo-as-emotion physics is implicit, not over-explained. Progressive disclosure via living shell sidesteps standard prophecy trope. Canyon setting is specific enough to resist swap-out. Emotional calculus—betrayal yielding spectral sorrow—anchors originality in human truth, not gimmick.</comment>
