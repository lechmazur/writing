<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet vow and tactile ritualism are vivid; the moment she splints the monarch with the moth wing crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only gap is a near-static internal stance until the butterfly appears; earlier micro-choices tweak method, not motive. Still, the final renunciation of permanence is earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: repeated weaving–pausing cadence builds density until the monarch’s arrival fractures and re-tunes the pattern. Closure lands as Charged Poise—her signal shifts from communication to compassionate anchor, cost felt in the loosening structures. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the moth wing archive origin is elided without setup, a hairline telegraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cloud-top grotto is sensory-selective: dew, starlight blossoms, and moss under boot pressure guide Elara’s haptic method. The luna-moth wing acts as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining the pivotal splint. Spatial track stays clean; environment evolves as structures loosen in breeze. One nip: weather is ornamental—no wind shear or chill actually tests the repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—tightens when celebrated monarch suddenly needs the forgotten moth; options narrow from symbolic ritual to irreversible material sacrifice. Escalation is single-wave, not compounded, but agency remains hers. Cost is legible: she forfeits her pristine archival relic and the structures’ communicative integrity. Could use one earlier obstacle to push stakes past 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through material inversion: neglected becomes essential, celebrated becomes dependent. Subtext lives in knot grammar—each tie shifts from commemoration to triage. Final image reweights “witness as preservation” without moralizing. Sentiment is restrained; only the single tear risks soft-focus, but it’s earned by vanishing monarch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Elara’s esorealist filter: grain of wood, root syntax,-archive dust. Rhythm flexes—long horticultural clauses collapse into “A flicker of orange...” for cardiac punch. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. One clause drifts toward editorial loft (“language of trust older than words”), but voice reclaim is quick.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence music varies; scaffolding is minimal. Figurative load is high but patterned (weave/knot/signal) and pays off. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Only micro-stutter: “transiently rooted” reused twice within four lines near midpoint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Butterfly vs. moth valorization is fresh; archival-salvage splint feels inevitable yet unexampled. Structure’s intentional collapse ties artifact to entropy without preaching. Concept risks familiarity—“last monarch” eco-elegy—but specificity of method and the ligature image sidestep cliché.</comment>
