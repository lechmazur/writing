<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet vow” is stated, not dramatized; interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“listening heals the fractures time leaves”). The final gesture—inserting the key—aligns with her stated motive, yet the lack of visible internal contradiction or micro-choice under pressure keeps her short of full individuality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: locket → key → mailbox → letters → shrine. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (community stance shift) with felt cost (official unpins notice). Orientation is swift; the 120-word anchor is met and the lens (Causal) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Courtyard, bench, mailbox, and locket are tactile and tracked; jasmine steam and bougainvillea color the air without stalling motion. The olive-branch key finally charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent as neighbors gather and the official arrives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the mailbox before noon—is signaled early and tightens once the city notice appears. Escalation is single-cycle rather than iterative; the external deadline supplies pressure, but Elara’s agency is largely receptive (listening, assembling), so the cost feels communal rather than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—stories as communal healing—emerges through accreted voices, not sermon. The final image of the shrine reweights the mailbox from obstruction to vessel of memory, achieving non-literal resonance. No moralizing tagline; the granddaughter’s request keeps meaning embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is curator-close (“pressed flower” memory, thrift-store calm). Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic lift at the reveal. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but idiomatic (“Let their story be whole”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, image-rich, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“sandstorm calm”) and paid off. Sentence variety supports the hush-to-release arc. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “locked mailbox as community scar” is fresh; the locket-key reveal is gentle rather than gimmicky. Risk is modest—no formal experiment—yet the synthesis of bureaucratic threat with heirloom tenderness feels specific to this courtyard. Could travel further from feel-good template.</comment>
