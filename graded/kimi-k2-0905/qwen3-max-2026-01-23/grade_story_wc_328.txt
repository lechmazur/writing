<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Aris’s disgraced-scientist shame and Lyra’s half-plant serenity are sketched in vivid, contradictory flashes; the pivotal moment where Aris’s “flint-hard certainty” fractures is palpable. Interiority sometimes drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“a harmony untamed”) that softens raw contradiction. The final protective choice carries cost, but the emotional ladder leading to it is more asserted than climbed in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Aris’s pivot from expose-to-protect is a legible DC charged by the arrowhead’s dissolution and Lyra’s address. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of foxfire glow, flint dust, dew pirouette reweights stakes toward wonder. Causality is lightly elliptical—exact mechanism of static-to-metamorphosis is asserted not demonstrated—but pattern coherence pays off at final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Subterranean garden, foxfire, hovering dewdrop—environmental objects double as micro-setting that constrains and finally embodies the transformed Lyra. The cordless-phone crack literalizes “static-laden confessions,” grounding speculative rules early. Spatial choreography stays clean; only minor sensory overload when every vine and spore is given adjectival flourish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Aris’s need to decide whether to expose the cryptid—emerges late yet crystallizes with visible price: her forfeiture of academic redemption. Tightening comes via the arrowhead’s glow and Lyra’s address, forcing an irrevocable stance. Escalation is more imagistic than obstacle-based; a sharper mid-scene obstacle could have raised cost earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed wonder emerges through iterative plant-light imagery rather than thesis lines. Final “cosmic joke” is voiced lightly by Elara but felt via Aris’s tear against frost—an earned, non-moral reweighting. Avoids overt profundity, though “frostbitten hope” skates close to aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Aris with lyric compression; perceptual signature (“soil on weathered cheeks,” “gravitationally playful lightness”) is consistent and atmospheric. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels academic-observer rather than field-scientist, but voice never lapses into template cadence. Static-and-phone device taught early, paid off in Lyra’s leaf-rustle dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variation; high noun-to-adverb ratio. Some metaphor clusters border on excess (“cathedral of roots and resilience”) yet serve atmospheric density. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Closing line’s “frost began … to thaw” is an elegant reverb on earlier frostbitten motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of botanic body-horror with analog static-language feels fresh; cryptid-as-ecstatic-symbiosis flips standard monster trope. Flint arrowhead dissolving into fertile dust is an irreversible image that reweights both scientific evidence and mythic return. Risky lyric register nearly over-eggs, but coherence holds.</comment>
