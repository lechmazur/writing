<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is vivid in the opening beats, but the interior contradiction promised never arrives; she moves from passive watching to passive placement of the shard without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The final “quiet blaze” insight is asserted, not dramatized through body or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the cottage’s aliveness is reweighted by the accumulated “displaced love” archive, and the orris shard’s burial is the visible cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the story recounts rather than stages the decisive moment; we are told the hush “descends” rather than shown a sensory shift that forces her stance change, keeping the beat just off the 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cherry-blossom bay, cedar-shingled cottage, and salt-silvered gate are concrete, selective, and filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze. The orris root’s powdery violet against damp bay air is tactile and purposeful, charging the final image; however, the uphill “newer houses” sketch is generic, preventing full 9-band constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—remains intellectual; no external obstacle or internal risk escalates after she plants the shard. Pressure plateaus: the “profound hush” is sensory, not tactical, so options don’t narrow and no price is exacted from her, keeping escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of sanctified displacement emerges organically via the cottage’s sea-glass, feather, and now the Tuscan shard; the insight that “a house feels alive when it becomes a sanctuary for displaced love” is earned through imagistic accrual rather than statement. Final sentence reweights the premise without moralizing, though the uphill vs. cottage contrast edges toward thematic over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—slow sag of porch step, ivy’s patient climb—creating a hushed, violet-tinged cadence. No head-hop; compressions like “daydreaming of daylight” are taught early and paid off when streetlights deepen their glow at closure, giving the prose a controlled musicality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple, with sentence variety and purposeful paragraphing; however, occasional modifier stacks (“quiet blaze of intentional love”) flirt with abstraction, and two near-paraphrase lines about the hush soften propulsion. No loops or mixed metaphors, but the crest beat could shed one adjectival layer for 9-band clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Houses animated by carried objects” is fresh territory; the orris shard as “solidified silence” and the archive of beach stones and feathers feel specific to this coastal edge. Risk is quiet—lyric accretion rather than plot twist—yet the synthesis lingers; it avoids familiar hauntological tropes through grounded domestic detail.</comment>
