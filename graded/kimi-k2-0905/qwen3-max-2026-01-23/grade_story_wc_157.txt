<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s guarded-spark motive is viscerally anchored in the audit flashback; his micro-choice to bury the seed fuses defiance with scholarly precision. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the buried gourd seed like a heartbeat”). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost—the city-wide gamble—but the beat is single-note; no contradictory impulse complicates his resolve on-page, keeping the arc just shy of top-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the impossible cicada chorus reconfigures surveillance-night into solidarity with undeniable cost (“dawn would bring risk”). Causal chain holds—seed → rattle → simultaneous activation—tight under 800 words. Orientation is swift; no prop or motive break. A hairline slip: Petrova’s tear mention edges toward label, but it doesn’t dent the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, pinned morphos, and soil acidity are filtered through Aris’s lexicon-hoarding gaze; every sensory note is used—aphid absence signals patrols, soil pH forecasts rain. The glass walls literally refract moonlight to cue the warp, so environment constrains the final tactic. Only minor wish: one tactile handle of the rattle-shell mid-scene would perfect the object-as-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“untaxed thought”—is signaled inside 40 words and intensifies when moonrise forces the go/no-go moment. Agency is clear: Aris plants, codes, and will shake; escalation is the tightening sirens plus biologically-impossible cicadas that narrow escape options. Cost is legible (“dawn would bring risk”), though the state’s counter-move remains abstract, capping the pressure just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—cognitive liberty through botanical inscription—emerges from action, never sermon. Final cicada image reweights every prior seed planted as a line of encrypted poetry the state cannot read. Complexity is honored: no moral certitude, only communal risk. One stray “they see only plants” flirts with Echo, but subtext still dominates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Aris’s shoulder with ink-stained, lexicon-hoarding diction—syntax mirrors his hoarding (“converging chaos unfolded”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under moonlight. Dialogue indirection is crisp; Petrova’s soil-pH line carries double meaning without exposition. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for greenhouse calm, clipped fragments as sirens invade—tight control through peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-density lines (“root systems and pollinator paths to create temporary blind spots”) do triple duty—world, stake, tactic. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (pollinator paths ≠ mixed vehicle). One minor scaffold: “converging chaos” is repeated as a refrain—acceptable because pattern is taught early and pays off in final cathedral image. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “taxable thought” dystopia is familiar, but integration with entomological cipher-gardens and a gourd-rattle signal device is genuinely fresh. Specificity—the soil pH patrol code, cicada-call rhythm—makes the premise feel inevitable in hindsight. Structural risk (lyric accumulation vs. set-piece fight) is embraced and lands cleanly. Could not swap seed, greenhouse, or codified flora without collapsing the story logic.</comment>
