<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-versus-permeability motive is coherent and embodied in the laser test, but her “spatial gift” remains a label; it never constrains or enables a single on-page action, so the interior contradiction feels announced rather than dramatized. Kael functions as gentle chorus, not pressure source, so the relationship alters nothing at stake; the final tear is earned, yet the cost is purely declarative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern (grief → permeability metaphor → laser pass) tightens once and lands a clean Charged Poise: the silent alarm registers “no threat,” reweighting her emotional rule-set. Causality is lyric, not plot-based, but the pattern is taught early and closure carries undeniable conceptual cost (“grief shift” felt in the tear). Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Farm is vivid, selective, and continuously filters through Elara’s professional eye; the mycelial veil physically guides the final test, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; light, scent, and distance track without drift. One minor slip: “vault’s high windows” momentarily surface-levels the cavern, but the image recovers immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she let grief pass without alarm?—is signaled early and deepened once when Kael reframes permeability. The laser test is the single tightening beat; it forecloses the old “harden perimeter” stance with visible symbolic cost (tear). Pressure is coherent but solitary; no external antagonist or resource loss amplifies it further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit: security physics as grief physics. Subtext resides in the silent alarm’s null reading—an elegant CR that reweights the premise without sermon. Final line risks a hint of thesis-statement (“a new physics for living”) but survives because the image of light through fungus has already embodied the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter; syntax lengthens under reflection, then tightens for the beam test, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within her technical lexicon. One register drift: “quiet wildfire of connection” edges toward workshop idiom, but the metaphor is isolated and quickly grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and patterned (“cathedral of release,” “permeable barriers of shared humanity”) without cluttering causality. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences cradle reflection, then fracture into short beats for the laser climax, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm as emotional intrusion-detection lab is a fresh synthesis; the physics-of-letting-go conceit reframes standard grief tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but specificity of fungal optics and security protocol keeps it from feeling template. Could push further if the spatial gift had engineered an unexpected failure or workaround.</comment>
