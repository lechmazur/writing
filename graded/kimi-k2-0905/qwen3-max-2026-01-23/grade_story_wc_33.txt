<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is grounded in the sister’s broken promise, but the interiority drifts into lyrical generality (“quiet revolution beating in his chest”) instead of dramatized contradiction. Micro-choices are present—the bottle uncorking, the flower secured—but the stakes feel abstract because no live alternative path is ever risked or forfeited on-page. The emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied; a hairline slip keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arcade’s tiles “shimmer with newfound warmth,” reconfiguring meaning while the patrol drone’s retreat leaves the cost of future exposure legible. Causal chain (bottle→overload→privacy→drone launch) holds without gaps; orientation is anchored by word 50. One tightening beat suffices; persistent constraint (repurposed drone could be discovered) shapes tactics. Missing only a sharper tactile price in the final image to reach 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade’s twilight glaze is not backdrop: its color hides the repurposed drone, its tile geometry guides Kael’s stealth, and the final shimmer recharges the earlier “liquid sapphire” line. Sensory selection stays inside the postal ritual—boot whispers, bottle’s violet flash—mirroring interior hush. Micro-setting (satchel, bottle, loose tile) directly constrains every move. World-rule consistency is immaculate; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving clandestine connection under drone surveillance—is signaled early and tightened once when the patrol drone forces bottle use, foreclosing stealth. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, yet the single turn suffices for 600-word scope. Cost is visible (bottle charge spent, drone now airborne and discoverable), but the price feels technical rather than visceral because Kael’s body is never in jeopardy. Sufficient for high-band, short of 9+ until stakes pierce the skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—“healing begins by tending absences”—emerges through the ledger of silences and the flower/message bridge rather than any statement. Subtext lives in gesture: bottle uncorking = respectful rebellion, pressed forget-me-not = maternal continuity. Final image of tiles “humming with fragile electricity” reweights the arcade from sorrow to possibility without moralizing. A hairline reserve because the sister’s promise remains off-page abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited cadence stays hushed, postal, reverent; diction (“weathered satchel,” “brittle hush”) is controlled and consistent. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; perceptual signature is the cartographer’s precision applied to human absence. Syntax lengthens under emotional pressure yet avoids drumbeat. One clause drifts slightly poetic (“drank the twilight”) but remains within Kael’s heightened perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without clutter; no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative layer is selective—bottle storm, liquid sapphire—and each vehicle returns to charge closure. Opening and closing lines bookend the arc cleanly. A single over-adorned phrase (“sacred and sorrowful”) barely nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses postal noir with low-fantasy insurgence, then localizes it inside a single tiled corridor: fresh yet inevitable. “Thunderstorm in a bottle” could read gimmick, yet here it is a limited resource with spent charge, not deus ex machina. Absence-as-map method reframes surveillance grid into tender geography. Risk is present but not reckless; transformation feels specific to this voice, not prompt scaffolding.</comment>
