<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her quiet vow, the steady hand on the projector, the final unbroken stance—each micro-choice embodies the archivist-flaw that both enables and endangers her. The moment she decides not to flee crystallizes a hierarchy of values with unmistakable cost: capture traded for continent-wide transmission. No stock labels; her fear is breathed in “wet earth and resolve,” not named. The only bar to 9+ is the absence of an on-page contradictory impulse in the final beat; she is monolithic rather than split.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the truth is aloft, enforcers crash the grove, Elara’s refusal to run reconfigures every prior risk into earned stasis. Causal chain holds—key → booth → microfilm → lagoon-as-transmitter—each because/therefore link narrows her options until only capture or broadcast remains. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“auric lagoon’s edge”) and never loosens. Cost is legible in the closing image: flashlights replacing starlight, the line held but the body forfeit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lagoon’s mineral optics are not scenery; they are the indispensable amplifier that turns puddle into planet-wide screen, a setting-as-tool that directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: hoof-print → willow alignment → ironwood grove → booth between stones → shoreline projector; every move is trackable. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s archivist eye—reflection geometry before scent, catalogued detail before danger—keeping description character-filtered. Only the micro-projector’s weight and battery source go unmentioned, a hairline omission that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will the erased be re-seen?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once: when the ripples lock Venus to willow, foreclosing any alternate route. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each successful unlock (key, panel, signal bloom) simultaneously increases both reach and exposure, a linked rise in payoff and peril. No reversal is needed; the single decisive tightening satisfies short-form economy. The price—her imminent arrest—is visible in the final crunch of gravel, but because the consequence is still incoming rather than felt, the score stops just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between archival fidelity and state amnesia; no character ever names “truth” or “memory,” letting the projected faces speak. The golden water-screen reprises the opening “internal gold,” re-weighted from aesthetic wonder to civic weapon—a conceptual repricing that lands the theme without exposition. Subtext resides in silence: the absent names of the captured allies flicker in negative space between projected smiles. The ending refuses moral balancing; indifference is not lectured, simply lit and scattered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual signature—cataloguing, angle-calculating, risk-weighing—syntax lengthens under reflection then fractures into staccato beats (“She did not flee. She stood firm”). No dialogue appears; voice remains coherent under pressure. Register stays within an archivist’s lexicon until the final metaphoric lift—“ghost the revised histories could not contain”—a justified surge because the moment is already outside normal time. The absence of spoken lines prevents voice-split stress, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long reflective coils to clipped imperative as danger nears; no two adjacent sentences open identically. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor load-bearing: “tapestry of stars” frames scale, “ghost” names the uncontainable data. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances image, stakes, or tactic. A single mixed vehicle—“truth...scattered like seeds across the continent”—survives because the agricultural seed dovetails with the lagoon’s organic diffusion, not enough to blemish closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The brass key to a scrapped telecom booth that hijacks dormant satellites is a fresh, non-obvious MacGuffin that fuses retro-tech with near-future salvage. Combining census microfilm, auric water-as-screen, and satellite bounce creates a specific synthesis that would collapse if any layer were swapped out. The puddle-map legend feels novel yet inevitable once the mineral optics are established. Risk is taken—quiet archivist becomes cosmic broadcaster—but coherence is maintained, meriting the high band.</comment>
