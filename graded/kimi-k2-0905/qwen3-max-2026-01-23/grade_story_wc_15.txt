<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is vividly internalized—her sleepwalking feet “learning the stone’s language” shows embodied contradiction—but the arc is essentially a single, foreordained ritual; no micro-choice undercuts or complicates her resolve, so the “cost” feels symbolic rather than personally transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stitched overlap layers dream-memory into tangible path, climaxing in the resilient orchid tied off with silver thread—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly memorializes loss while opening future access; causality is lyric, not consequential, but closure still carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon walls, orchid scent, and moon-silk thread are filtered through Elara’s weaver perception; the ceramic plate literally guides placement, and the final orchid-root knot fuses setting with closure, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending severed memory—tightens as each overlapping dream-path forecloses alternative routes; the circle sewn around the ruined basin is the decisive narrowing that crystallizes her stance, but external opposition is absent, keeping pressure poetic rather than perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “mending through scars” emerges via stitch-pattern rather than statement; the refrain “thread by thread” accretes new weight when tied to the living orchid, offering a non-literal answer about renewal without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s tactile cognition; whalebone needle, moon-silk, and salt-cured fingers deliver a perceptual signature that modulates into mantra cadence (“Sew”) under peak attention without losing clarity—clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, carry dense sensory information, and avoid loops; occasional stacked epithets (“hauntingly optimistic resolve”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and never muddies the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sleep-walking cartography turned into hand-sewn trail is a fresh conceit; the risk of lyric repetition is mostly rewarded, though resonances lean on archetype (lost garden, resilient orchid) rather than surging into fully unforeseen territory.</comment>
