<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—folding cranes, placing lockets—each action tightening the jeweler’s identity and loss. The contradictory impulse to abandon craft yet keep creating under Lena’s mandate gives credible internal pressure. Final renunciation of despair costs her the safety of numbness, earned by sustained imagery of seed-pendants and coordinate bracelets. Only slight over-articulation: “genuinely artificial” label repeated without new inflection mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the night sky reconfigures grief into vocation via a concrete grove of bioluminescent fungi visible through the eyepiece, cost paid in tears and the relinquished locket. Accumulative lens holds: each placed crane intensifies pattern until telescope reveals payoff; no causal gaps. Curtains parted = decisive irreversible beat. Date/place anchored within first 110 words; no orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy favors aged brass scent and rice-fiber friction—jeweler’s POV filters notice. Observatory velvet becomes choice-gating prop; locket micro-setting charges final image. Valley grove described only when it reweights stakes; prior restraint makes payoff vivid. No physics errors; spatial choreography clean across dome, pedestal, egress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara rekindle meaning after Lena’s death? Pressure tightens via each origami drop, narrowing avoidance options until telescope forces confrontation. Bioluminescent grove discovery = irreversible escalation; no deus-ex machina—coordinates stem from vellum planted early. Felt price: softened grief replaces numb security, visible in tear-warmed cheeks and locket left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of intentional artifice emerges through craft objects—lockets, cranes, fungi constellation—rather than exposition. “Genuinely artificial” refrain transitions from abstract to lived paradox as Elara accepts human-made hope as valid truth. Final image of sunlight on locket offers non-literal answer: beauty wrought by design can outshine organic loss. No moralizing sentence; resonance arises from material specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: jeweler’s fixation on texture—silver grain, rice paper fiber, brass chill—renders inner weather. Rhythm compresses under observatory hush, elongates during folding meditation. No head-hopping; single POV distance stable. Control of sentence cadence mirrors heartbeat rise at curtain parting, then exhalation closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: one line folds memory, tool, and action (“cold tools felt like old friends welcoming her home”) without scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles mechanical (locket beacon, constellation map) stay consistent. Zero filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless ascent sentence to staccato workshop return.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of origami astronomy with bioluminescent horticulture feels fresh; not a trope stack. “Curtains of intention” could have been gimmick but becomes concrete telescope veil with cognitive threshold function. Risk in lyric repetition of “genuinely artificial” pays off via conceptual repricing. Specificity of jeweler-craft details prevents generic grief template.</comment>
