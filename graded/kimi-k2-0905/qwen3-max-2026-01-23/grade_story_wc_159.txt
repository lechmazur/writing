<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s devotion is palpable through ritualized micro-choices and embodied tenderness toward the cracked tube, but the interior contradiction never sharpens—no moment where preservation duty collides with private doubt or irreversible cost. The tear is a performed beat rather than a forced concession; we feel caretaker fatigue, not a value hierarchy tested under pressure. Still, her solitary choreography and the fingertip reverence give us a singular, irreplaceable consciousness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked tube’s altered song re-weights every prior echo, leaving the library’s silence newly inhabited. Causal chain (lens → dawn → fracture → duet → orchid ignition) is clean, with “foxglove regret” the persistent price that shapes tactics. Light shift at the end visibly forecloses the ritual, crystallizing meaning without exposition. The Orient test is met at line 5; spatial anchors hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The opal walls, crystalline oculus, and cracked bamboo form a micro-setting that materially constrains every move: no lens-shift, no capture, no names. Cloud-sea isolation and solidified mist spire are evoked once, then folded into sensory action—footfall whispers, refracted beam heat—avoiding white-room syndrome. The library’s iridescent veins evolve with the light cue, mirroring internal glow of captured names. Setting is not toured; it is wielded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve identities from absolute silence—is signaled early and tightened by the cracked tube’s indispensability: without its fracture the authentic resonance is impossible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the altered duet splits memory from mourning, forcing Elara to house both in separate orchids—an irreversible allocation of sonic real estate. Price is felt in the lingering foxglove ache that irradiates each bloom; no coincidence intervenes. Escalation is accumulative/textural, not causal-reversal, and suffices for this lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without preaching: remembrance as love’s highest form is proven by the ritual’s cost—the crack that wounds the song is the wound that lets it speak. Subtext lives in gesture: the fingertip trace on flawed bamboo confesses caretaker complicity in damage. Final image of orchids “holding light against encroaching silence” offers conceptual repricing—beauty purchased by perpetual ache. No moralizing sentence caps the piece; meaning is left vibrating inside the glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains luminous distance suited to mythic vocation; perceptual signature filters every detail through caretaker priorities—vein-shift color, petal resonance, dawn angle. Syntax breathes with ritual cadence yet avoids monotony; clause length modulates around light-cue climax. No dialogue required; voice coherence peaks in the murmured gratitude to the crack. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) stays within a caretaker-scholar lexicon earned by the library’s archive ethos.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and propulsive: each sentence layers image, motion, stakes (“sun’s first beam… only force potent enough”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent (foxglove regret threads bioluminescent poison into nostalgia). One mixed image—“echo filtered through fracture”—is justified by physical acoustics. Final paragraph avoids sentimental diffuser; cadence slows to match fading song without syntactic collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory conservation with botanic acoustics; the cracked bamboo as necessary flaw feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in lyric accumulation rather than plot reversal, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, because fracture physics and orchid resonance are bound to this invented archive. Some phrasing drifts toward archetype (“endless ocean of clouds”), but core mechanism is fresh.</comment>
