<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction—control vs surrender—plays out in live gesture (hand tightens while praising trust). The final renunciation is earned: twenty years of frantic repair collapse into one tactile release of the leaf. Micro-choice tracked throughout (return leaf, plant hostas beneath new shade) makes the shift legible and irreversible. Cost is felt in the relinquished habit of command; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of storm aftermath → observation → surrender deepens once, then reweights via new growth imagery. Closure lands as Charged Poise—leaf bookmarked, no repair planned—cost is the forfeited certainty of control. Orientation anchored within 120 words; causality intact (storm damage → altered stance → altered nursery practice). No meaningful slips near the image.</comment>

<comment>Mossy trellis, rain-soaked soil, and filtered light constrain later planting choices (hostas beneath new shade). Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Elara’s shifting attention: first scrubbed crevices, later welcomed moss. Environment mirrors internal arc without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs collaboration—tightens once after the leaf insight; option of “perfect order” is foreclosed when she walks away without repair plan. Agency visible in every beat: leaf returned, willow left bent, journal recast. Cost legible: surrender of lifelong method. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: clover in disturbed soil, arcing willow, moss as collaborator. Final image—hand on trellis feeling earth’s pulse—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. No echoing of “reluctant metamorphosis” as label; transformation shown via changed practice. Complexity preserved: storms remain destructive yet catalytic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature consistent: horticultural lexicon, tactile attention to veins, soil, micro-life. Rhythm controlled—long breathing sentences calm after storm, mirroring new stance. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Distinction maintained even under emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Figurative language sparse and accurate (“emerald velvet,” “whispered secret”). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines bookend arc cleanly. Micro-movements serve pressure; no puppet-joint narration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar garden-epiphany frame is refreshed through nursery-owner specificity and reversed stance toward moss/bent branches. Willow’s graceful curve and bookmarked leaf feel particular to this voice. Risk is moderate—quiet surrender instead of dramatic storm confrontation—but coherent to character. Could edge higher with sharper ecological insight or societal resonance.</comment>
