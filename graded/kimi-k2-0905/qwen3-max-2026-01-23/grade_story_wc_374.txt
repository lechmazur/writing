<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—luminous skin vs. skeptical mind—remains embodied through every beat; the tongue-taste mechanic externalizes doubt and lets micro-choices (ring on, step forward) visibly escalate. The shift from cool silver to warm gold encodes earned change without explanatory filler, and the private rain inside the stone circle exacts a physical cost for her new belief. Grandmother’s voice is used only as remembered trigger, not as corrective exposition, keeping knowledge strictly character-bound. Interiority stays specific to her POV; no diagnostic self-talk dilutes the final conversion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: “compassion itself was the true compass” reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative lens, with the personal rain and taste-shift making cost undeniable. Causality holds via the taste-map (lavender→honey→rain) that sequences each forward move; no off-stage shortcuts. Set-up anchors who/where within 50 words, beating the 120-word safety window. The grandmother echo lands as stimulus, not amendment, so no retro-patch break occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, and forest election are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—smell first, sight second—so detail never catalogues. The tin ring’s warming/cooling states track causal beats, qualifying it as micro-setting that constrains action. Spatial choreography is clean: bluff→stones→descent, all distances implied by taste transitions rather than exposition. Weather converges only on the circle, making environment an active participant in the final image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“is personalized weather real?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when copper-error shifts to honey-alignment, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior (accept perception) yet produces visible external change (personal rain), satisfying the Accumulative escalation model. No coincidence resolves the core question; the aurora’s reply is cosmetic affirmation, not causal fix. Price is legible: lifelong skepticism dissolved and replaced by empathic burden she must now literally carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sequence of tastes rather than any articulated thesis; the final honey-rain reconfigures “listening world” without moralizing. Recurrent lavender functions as perceptual motif, not symbol grafted late—its meaning reweights from alignment cue to homecoming flavor. Ambiguity stays alive: the forests’ compassion vote could be anthropomorphic projection, letting readers balance wonder and skepticism. No tidy maxim closes the loop; resonance is delivered by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Elara’s senses, tightening psychic distance under aurora glare; diction—“ozone’s crisp promise,” “salt, crushed lavender”—is hers, not tourist brochure. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during convergence, then widens into longer cadence for descent, mirroring emotional release. No head-hop; grandmother’s line is reported memory, not interior invasion. Voice remains coherent while color-shifting from metallic skepticism to organic acceptance.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: figurative language appears in <40% of sentences and each image advances cause or texture. No synonym loops or paraphrase clusters; “taste” variants are distinct stimuli (lavender/rosemary/honey). Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one sweep; final line releases image instead of summary. Only minor filter verb (“she understood”) is justified as internal closure beat, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Taste-based directional compass” is fresh hardware married to ecological empathy election, a synthesis not seen in standard eco-fantasy. Mythic standing-stones and aurora are familiar furniture but repurposed as sensory interface rather than spectacle. Risk of sentimental eco-parable is dodged by maintaining epistemic doubt until the final molecule of honey. Specificity of tongue-map and personal rain makes the concept impossible to swap into another tale without structural collapse.</comment>
