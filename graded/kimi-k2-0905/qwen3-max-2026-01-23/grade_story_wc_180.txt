<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the past and hunger for renewal—are dramatized in her tactile choices with silk, resin, ribbon. Interiority stays concrete, tied to lens and tool; the moment she knots the ribbon is both apology and wager, costing her the last clean stance of “restorer.” Lyra’s late entrance could use one beat of embodied reaction before dialogue, but the mother/daughter crucible still tilts. Micro-choices (warming resin, weaving ribbon) reveal value hierarchy without sermon.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each repair material is introduced → tested → complicates next step, culminating in the ribbon that reconfigures the breach itself. Closure is a CR beat: the cerulean ribbon flutters as visible, social cost—deciduous vows now live law in their valley. Cost is legible in the final image; no reset, no lucky off-stage fix. Orientation anchored by word 40; no penalty.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is not backdrop; its sway dictates the need for flexible resin and cherry-branch splints. Micro-setting (rose-window frame, pew surface) constrains posture and tool choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s quartz-eye bias—fractured light, resin scent, ribbon texture. Final image recharges the same dappled light, now filtered through woven ribbon, marrying setting to theme.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridge generational rift—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when ribbon choice risks Lyra’s scorn. Escalation is accumulative: each layer of silk/resin ups the stakes of failure under orchard sway. No external antagonist; pressure is time + material fragility + emotional exposure. Cost visible in final ribbon flutter: public declaration of revised creed.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of shedding: diocese shed stone, trees shed leaves, Elara sheds rigid restoration. No explicit thesis; insight crystallizes in image, not sermon. “Deciduous vows” reweights the moral rule-set without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: progress and preservation now interdependent, not opposed.</question>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder, diction filtered through tactile precision of a mender: “quartz lens clicking,” “amber tears.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses during resin burn, then lengthens for reflective ribbon weave. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior accessed only through gesture and speech. Voice stays consistent, with modest, earned modulation.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. High density: one line often does description + interiority + causal push (“She warmed the resin until it flowed like amber tears, sealing the silk”). Figurative language sparse except where taught (deciduous vow metaphor paid off). Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns clean. Final line cadence mirrors opening light fracture, supplying echo without clutter.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of cathedral + orchard + contract breach feels fresh yet inevitable. Ribbon-as-bind transforms from childhood keepsake to structural ligature—an interior logic impossible to swap. Concept of “deciduous vows” offers non-obvious moral tech: shedding as loyalty, not betrayal. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final image reconfiguration.</question>
