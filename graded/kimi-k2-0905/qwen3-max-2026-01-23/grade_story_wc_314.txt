<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—precision vs sentimentality enacted in thumb-stroking the river stone while clutching the crystal. Embodied emotion arrives (“tears, warm and unbidden”) without label-speak. Final synthesis is earned because the copper-lattice micro-choice replicates the starling epiphany and visibly mends her fracture; cost is the risk of shattering the crystal and, by extension, her identity. Cap 8.7 because the mentor memory remains a static talisman rather than a blind spot that could complicate the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the flame-river-crystal act reweights her entire epistemology under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—starling pattern → copper lattice → guided fire → internal mend—each beat because/therefore linked. Cost is legible in the final image: “rigid walls… dissolved,” a permanent conceptual repricing. One hairline slip: “decades of study” is off-page exposition, but it never drives a turn, so no cap breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard: the living orchard constrains—silver bark breathes, mossy stones resonate, waterfall prism fractures light that literally colors the climax. The copper brazier and woven wires function as micro-setting that channels the decisive flame. Spatial choreography is immaculate; body, crystal, flame, lattice remain trackable. Slight over-adorning of “kaleidoscopic” twice keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens once: flame violence vs starling grace forecloses the brutal path. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues. Cost is felt (possible irreversible fracture), but the price is more conceptual than tangible resource loss, capping entry to 8+ band. Still, the single deepening is meaningful and lens-coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges purely through image and action: starling murmuration = non-violent synthesis, copper spiral = embodied belief. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the golden pulse on the trees is the non-literal answer. Complexity acknowledged—she doesn’t renounce logic but invites it to dance. Sentimental river stone never moralizes, merely witnesses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is alchemist-poetic: “liquid luminescence swirled in currents mirroring the starlings’ remembered flight”—exact yet mystic. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadence for murmuration, short choppy clauses at throat-tightening frustration. No head-hop; single POV holds. Filter verbs (“she felt”) appear only when they serve interior distance, not clutter. One syntactic echo (“kaleidoscopic” twice) prevents a flat 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “She ignited the brazier, and the flame, channeled through the woven copper, transformed from a chaotic blaze into a gentle, undulating river of light” advances action, sets image, and enacts theme. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor (flame as river, starlings as scripture) is internally coherent and pays off in the final glow. Zero artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar alchemist trope is renewed by precise occupation detail: lattice-as-murmuration replaces rote sigils. Starling aerodynamic epiphany as non-violent method feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure instead of antagonist plot—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Orchard-waterfall could risk pastoral cliché, but silver-barked breathing trees and prism optics particularize it.</comment>
