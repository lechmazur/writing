<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—terror of the buckle versus need to revise—drives every beat; the embodied shiver/pen scratch shows simultaneous impulses. Trust-preservation motive tightens through micro-choices (line-through, stance shift) with visible cost (tear, lighter burden). Final stance crystallizes under earned causality; no safety-hedging. Could edge 9+ if memory flash gave one additional present-tactic fumble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens holds: star-fracture pattern → vine-lens idea → revised log → radio send; each beat deepens density and reweights stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses flawed report path with felt cost (tear, lighter burden). Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Cost legible on last line “whispered back”; persistent constraint (continued watch) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frost-kissed vine, obsidian floor, and buckle function as micro-setting that constrain stance angles and tool use; each recurs to charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold metal, silent vacuum) mirrors interior pressure without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean across crystalline platform moves. Environment could edge 9+ if temperature visibly numbed fingers mid-revision to heighten risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust via accurate forecast—signaled early; Serpent fracture tightens options. One meaningful deepening: buckle memory escalates to vine-lens tactic, foreclosing sloppy log option with visible cost (tear). Agency drives every turn under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent. Could reach 8.8 if price (e.g., frostbite twinge) had altered final typing rhythm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-covenant emerges through revised numbers and silent radio contract; no thesis stated. Recurring buckle shifts from trauma emblem to covenant seal, reweighting meaning at closure. Final whispered exchange offers non-literal answer: trust is reciprocal vigilance. Ambiguity lingers—sky’s whisper could be echo or cosmic reply—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited retains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors astral geometry and tactile metal. Syntax stretches for lyric reach yet stays within Elara’s lexicon (“celestial code,” “harmonic spiral”). No filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates from long breaths to single-line radio snap. Head-hop absent; voice coherence sustains through peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative layering (“soundless echo,” “sacred shroud”) remains coherent under accumulative mode; no mixed metaphors. High density: frost/obsidian/buckle triad performs triple duty (atmosphere, tool, symbol). Final line cadence earns quiet release without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Celestial arbor weather-station is fresh frame; parachute buckle repurposed as revision totem transforms familiar object. Specificity of silverwood vines refracting starlight prevents generic sky-lab. Synthesis feels inevitable rather than quirky. Risk in lyric compression pays off; could push 8.8 with one unexplained world rule (why vines refract) seeded earlier.</comment>
