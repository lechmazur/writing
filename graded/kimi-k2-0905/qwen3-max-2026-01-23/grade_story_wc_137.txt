<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. the need to comfort Liam—play out in real time through the tactile choice to place the tile; her tear-streaked transcription embodies the cost. Interiority is concrete, body-bound, and stakes scale to the sanctuary she must now guard. Only a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“skepticism bowed”) keeps her just shy of perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “He’s part of this journey… not gone… just traveling” crystallizes both Liam’s stance and the tower’s reconfigured meaning; Elara’s promise to “honor every visitor” shows the persistent constraint. The causal chain—tile → alignment → entanglement → transcription → solace—holds without gaps; the meridian line and journal diagrams pay off the early set-ups.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt-laced wind, ink-dark sea, and the cooled obsidian tile at dawn constrain every emotional beat; the open tower’s meridian line literally channels the magic. Sensory selection tightens perceptually—moonlight silvering whales, vellum’s pearlescent sheen—mirroring Elara’s narrowing attention. One extra spatial beat on ladder or stair placement would anchor choreography to perfect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can the tower offer real solace without falsifying science?—tightens when aligning the tile risks Elara’s rational identity; the price is paid in irreversible belief. One meaningful escalation: the moment warmth blooms and centuries crash in, foreclosing pure skepticism. Cost is legible in the cooled stone and her promise to keep listening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: migration/return, star charts/whale song, loss/continuity—no moral spoken. The vellum on the wall reweights the tower from observatory to listening vessel; ambiguity survives because Elara’s promise is an ongoing practice, not a thesis. Final whispered line hands meaning to Liam, dodging authorial summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s body and perception; salt spray on “his cheeks” during entanglement is a sanctioned fusion moment. Syntax lengthens under entanglement pressure, then contracts at dawn, mirroring breath. No head-hop; the mentor’s whisper arrives as anchored memory. Voice distinctiveness could still sharpen with one signature idiom unique to Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary from wind-tugged lyric to clipped scientific note; no loops or scaffold. “Ink-dark sea,” “pearlescent sheen” operate as precise sensory shorthand, not stacked purple. Opening and closing lines book-end with migrating whales, giving circular muscle. Zero grammar issues; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing magic-square cosmology with cetacean navigation lore feels non-obvious and inevitable after the tile warms. Forgotten constellations (“Leaping Calf”) rescue the premise from generic mysticism. Risk of sentimental whale-whispering is dodged by keeping the symphony wordless and experiential. Could push further by letting one modern star name clash with the old pattern.</comment>
