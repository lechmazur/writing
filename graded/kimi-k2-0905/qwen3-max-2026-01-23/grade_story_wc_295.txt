<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s solitude-frayed interiority is palpable; the telegram triggers a visible micro-choice that reorients her stance. The single on-page relationship (Kael, via letter) functions as crucible: his remembered voice dissolves her stubborn isolation and reweights the watch. Cost is felt: she relinquishes lone ownership of the night. Missing only a deeper contradiction in-scene to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “We hold the light so you may close your eyes…” reweights the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens—cyclical star-dimming becomes covenant of shared breath. Telegram arrival is coincidence but functions only as catalyst, not resolution; real turn is her penned testament, cost legible in relinquished solitude. Pattern taught early (temple glyph → star cycles) pays off in final line without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory air (“aged paper and polished brass”) and Mira’s suspended dim act as micro-setting that directly enables insight. Daylily watermark on telegram reprises dream-glyph, charging final image. Environment constrains: only at telescope during deepest dim can translation ignite. Slight reserve: spatial choreography of dome interior could be one notch sharper for 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or surrender—tightens exactly once when Kael’s letter reframes dimming as invitation to rest, not failure. No reversals needed; single deepening suffices. Price is relinquishment of sole vigil; cost visible in her tears and subsequent testament. Agency is crystallized attention that chooses shared watch, foreclosing solitary path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: variable stars as communal heartbeat, vigilance passed like lantern. Daylily—fleeting bloom—reweights from lonely beauty to shared succession without moralizing. Final inscription is earned epiphany, not assertion. Subtle irony: her “healing words” heal herself first, then future readers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filtered through astronomer’s lexicon (“Mira’s deepest dim”) and dream-logic. Prosemodulates from fatigue-flatted cadence to luminous uplift without register drift. Telegram voiced in Kael’s gentler idiom provides clean external distinction. No head-hop; internal coherence tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with her ebb and surge of fatigue-to-clarity; no filler stacks. Figurative control precise: “suspended breath” marries stellar and human lungs. One adjacent paraphrase loop (“shared burden… shared light”) mild enough to spare 9-band. Otherwise high density, zero scaffolding, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses lucid-dream archaeology with stellar Morse code—fresh synthesis. Variable-star-as-passed-lantern metaphor transforms typical lone-astronomer trope into communal ethos. Risk is quiet interior arc, but coherence and lyrical payoff justify it. Specificity of pressed daylily telegram feels singular, not ornamental.</comment>
