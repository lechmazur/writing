<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s fear-spoken truth catalyzing the vine is a clean micro-choice with embodied cost; the “I am afraid my knowledge is not enough” line crystallizes interior contradiction under pressure. Motivation stays anchored to the diary gaps, driving every beat. Only the Warden’s sudden compliance feels fractionally convenient, muting flaw-driven struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each gap-research beat tightens options until the spoken fear germinates the vine—Decisive Change with felt cost. Closure lands on-page: stairway blooms, Kael solidifies, Elara’s stance re-orients from seeking to tending. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words. Persistent constraint: the diary’s voids now demand lifelong cultivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore breathes through POV-filtered detail—“grammar in the grooves of stone shelves”—and the diary-as-micro-setting constrains every tactic. Spatial choreography holds: from cavernous stacks to sprouting stone, positions track. Final image of “pages turning toward dawn” recharges threshold motif. Slight over-milked “silence” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Kael by learning from gaps—tightens when the torn harmony-ivy page forces Elara to voice fear, narrowing options to brutal honesty. Cost is visible: perpetual stewardship of unlearned lessons. Escalation under causal lens: because she admits lack, therefore vine grows, therefore Warden yields. One beat shy of second tightening for 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from negative-space pedagogy: absences as invitations, not failures. Final image of Elara “conducting the symphony of what could be” reweights prior silence motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Warden’s creaking joints hints at its own unspoken gaps. Complexity upheld: no tidy triumph, only ongoing cultivation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: arcane linguist hears “syntax of shadow,” sees moonpetals as “silver cartography.” Rhythm swells with pressure—fragments compress as Kael frays (“edges fraying like torn vellum”). No head-hopping; POV stable. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “torn pages, smudged sketches, deliberate voids” triples as imagery, stakes, and method. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—vine as question answered. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from hush to dawn cadence. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of ancient forests”) barely audible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: botany as linguistic archaeology, mountain bookstore as sentient pedagogy. Risky second-person address to Warden (“What gap have you...”) pays off by flipping power axis. Negative-space map feels inevitable in hindsight. No prior echo of harmony-ivy trope. Conceptual integrity absolute—story never retreats from its void-centric logic.</comment>
