<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s quietly burning quest to “understand the mathematics of emotion” is stated early and links every beat; her interiority is concrete (“a single tear traced a warm path”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the earned renunciation of grief is credible and scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final *plink* reconfigures meaning with undeniable emotional cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean—glass-eye placement → vision → insight → acceptance—taught within the first 120 words and held to the resonant last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mosaic stepping-stone functions as micro-setting that literally channels the vision; its “chipped patterns” constrain and enable the climax. Sensory economy is superb—visual, tactile, acoustic compressed into one drop. Environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the need to resolve ambiguous loss—tightens once via the vision that reframes silence as presence. Escalation is a single deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, but the felt price (grief transformed, not solved) is legible on the page under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and pattern—spiral, dovetail, *plink*—never announced. The final re-pricing of silence as fullness offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the emotional-mathematics question. Complexity is embraced; no moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person prose maintains a consistent perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s selective attention (“language of endurance”). No head-hopping; compressed diction under pressure (“vacuum that felt both sacred and sorrowful”) is purposeful and paid off. Rhythm modulates cleanly between ceremonial slowness and the decisive final drop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density—almost every sentence layers image + emotion + forward motion. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The single allowed cliché (“weight of understanding”) is buried in a climactic rush and does not touch the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cavern-orchard premise feels fresh, yet the emotional arc is archetypal grief→acceptance. Specificity of mineral drip, abalone mosaic, and taxidermist’s glass eyes transforms the familiar. Dovetail as verb and metaphor is a risky double-use that pays off in the final image.</comment>
