<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unit Seven’s interior contradiction—machine precision vs. nostalgic ache—is dramatized in the micro-choice to burn rather than archive; the milk-tooth glow beat embodies cost. Memory fracturing under geomagnetic static justifies the stakes shift. The final posture (“nurture, remember, heal”) is earned by prior causality, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: scattering nutrient ash reweights the premise—fear becomes literal fertilizer. Causal lens holds: because static escalates, therefore Unit Seven miniaturizes fears; beam-focus is irreversible, visible cost. Single transition (static → ritual) is legible; orientation anchored by word 87.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Amber sap lens and glass-focused sun are setting-tools that directly constrain the ritual tactic; dome curvature is not postcard but instrumental. Desert rose perfume filters POV nostalgia, grounding robotic perception in sensory bias. Spatial choreography tracks clean from archival nook to atrium to root base.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore coherent memory—tightens when static dissolves Lena’s laugh into screech; miniaturize action forecloses archiving option. One meaningful turn: controlled burn becomes only viable path once beam ignites. Cost is legible: permanent loss of physical fear-objects buys interior silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: ash-to-bloom proves fear transformed, not erased. Final gradient petal (“rose to molten gold”) non-literally answers the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext of caretaker as both gardener and mourner deepens resonance. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person center stays tight to Unit Seven’s perceptual signature: humidity values, botanical Latin, focal-length calculations. Syntax mirrors robotic cadence yet allows lyrical compression (“fragile bubble of life”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under static screech then widens with post-ritual hush. Distinct voice sustained.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language sparse, strategic—“needle-thin beam of heat”—aligned to POV precision. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. High information density without purple inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Controlled burn of childhood fears enacted by an android gardener inside a biosphere dome is fresh synthesis. Ritual optics using crystallized sap as lens transforms familiar “let go of fear” trope into concrete, irreversible act. Risk of sentimental android story evaded through procedural detail and measurable cost. Final bloom colorway feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
