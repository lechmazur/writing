<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian’s contradictory impulses—yearning vs. renunciation—are dramatized in the pendant beat; the final refusal costs the only chance of return, felt in the loosened grip. Interiority is concrete (“sob catch sharp as tearing vellum”), never label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: frost-rose memory > loosen pendant > accept exile. Missing 0.3 because no second character means status crucible is absent by scope, not flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: loosening the pendant forecloses return with visible ache; cost is the sealed rift’s soft chime. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of interiorized images (frost-rose, oak, mist) tightens until the spiral flare reweights exile as chosen. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“silent, frozen garden”). No causal break; every beat is because/therefore under the meditation loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen garden is not backdrop but moral gym: ice crystals fracture light into internal rainbows that later veto escape. Pendant-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice—its warmth against sternum is the literal pivot. Mist curls like smoke anchors POV bias toward thresholds. Spatial choreography clean: rift vertical, mist recoils, guardian settles against oak. Environment charges closure image (“mist flowed back, embracing…”)—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—befriend uncertainty or surrender to homesickness—signaled in paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when sunlight strikes pendant: option to return becomes live, narrows to single refusal. Cost is visceral: “ache…woven with threads of acceptance.” Under Accumulative lens, density of interiorized images escalates until refusal crystallizes stance. No reversal needed; one meaningful intensification satisfies 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: guardianship is tending the liminal, not owning the answer. Subtext in gesture—loosening pendant rather than clutching—reweights exile from wound to vocation. No moralizing; final image of mist embracing guardian is non-literal answer. Frost-rose reprise at climax reconfigures earlier beauty as ethical ballast. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers in “beautiful uncertainty.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to guardian’s perceptual signature: parchment skin, ink-stained claws, vellum-tear sob. Syntax lengthens under meditation, shortens under flare—“clawed hand tightening”—mirrors pulse. No head-hopping; diction stays within ancient-librarian lexicon (“beeswax polish,” “aged paper”). Distinctive rhythmic control: cadence of “wait…wait…wait” accumulates without monotony. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for mist, staccato under light-beam. Information density high—“silver spiral ignited with cold blue-white fire” does visual + tactile + symbolic work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “boundaries of light” repeated 3× in last third; does not dull closure. Line-level artifacts absent from final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Feral librarian exiled to frozen garden is fresh; trope of homesickness flipped into voluntary exile. Interiorizing exteriors method transforms static lyric into ethical engine. Pendant-as-threshold-not-key reconfigures betrayal relic into commitment token. Risky long meditation sustained by accruing sensory stakes; pays off in refusal. Specificity prevents swap with any melancholy immortal.</comment>
