<comment>Elara’s decisive kindness is shown, not told, through her choice to honor the shard; Arthur and Lena’s micro-choices (covering the shard together) embody earned reconfiguration. Interiority is concrete—Lena’s “grief a stone in her throat,” Arthur’s silent lip-moving—without diagnostic labels. The only drag: “decisively kind eyes” is a gestural shortcut that slightly blurs Elara’s internal contradiction; still, the final hand-clasp is proportionally scaled to 700 words and carries visible cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken vinyl becomes a shared emblem, foreclosing despair with on-page cost—Arthur’s whispered “I can hear her humming again.” Causal chain: shard → song → lavender scent → father-daughter reunion; each because/therefore link is legible. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The −0.1 reflects a micro-risk: the lavender release could feel coincidental, yet it’s seeded by Clara’s sachet memory and paid off as sensory repricing, so cost remains felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The hospice room’s “liquid gold” and “clouds like silent rivers” are filtered through grief-narrowed perception; visual dominance is justified by bedside stillness. The shard functions as micro-setting—its jagged edge literally constrains their hand-clasp—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara settles beside bed, Lena reaches across, curtain stirs. Only mild penalty: lavender scent arrives as fortunate breeze, not character-discovered object, slightly reducing tactile integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can goodbye be bearable?—tightens once: from frozen grief to shared remembrance via song. Agency is Elara’s choice to weave shard into lyric; cost is Lena’s surrender of solitary mourning. Escalation is single-wave, sufficient for 700-word lyric design; luck (lavender breeze) complicates but doesn’t resolve, since Arthur’s memory cue is earned. Could reach 8.8 if scent were actively retrieved by Lena rather than gifted by breeze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of “broken music still sings”; no explicit thesis. Subtext lives in silence—Arthur’s lip-sync, the unheard Ella track—creating dramatic irony between reader’s imagined song and characters’ quiet. Final reconfiguration revalues brokenness as wholeness without moralizing. The 0.1 deduction guards against slightly ornate metaphor density (“liquid gold,” “silent rivers”) that edges toward sentimentality, though it stays on the right side of earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient hovers but grounds in POV-specific perception: Lena notices clenched hands, Arthur notices coffee steam. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts at climax to Arthur’s clear-bright eyes. Syntax mirrors breath: long lyrical clauses for song, fragment bursts for shard handling. Dialogue is minimal and indirection-rich—“We’ll keep listening, Dad. Always.” carries subtext of lifelong vigil. Voice never slips into committee prose; lavender sentence is the lone soft-focus, hence −0.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control is exemplary—sentence lengths swell and ebb with song cadence. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; “hymned the mundane” is repeated twice but pattern-taught and paid off. Metaphors stay physically coherent (clouds drift below window). Minor over-writing in “pulsing stillness” (twice) and “radiant haven” (twice) nicks −0.4; still, information density is high—each sentence layers grief, object, and motion. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice-vinyl-lavender palette is transmuted through sensory specificity and the inversion that brokenness enables music. Risk is taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist; pattern is taught early (“hymning the mundane”) and fulfills at closure. Fresh inflection: the shard is not cured but sung into new connector. Slight deduction for thematic terrain—end-of-life music therapy—being well-trodden, though execution is individualized.</comment>
