<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—each physical interaction with the beaded wheel refracts Leo’s skepticism, grief, and filial loyalty. The drowsy-alert POV keeps thought under bodily stress, avoiding self-diagnosis, and the contradictory impulses—pride in rationalism vs. need for paternal vindication—collide in the final hand-turn with audible cost. Micro-choices (crunching steps, light-glint, bead-to-iron click) choreograph values clearly. The only drag: the grandfather remains off-page, so status/relationship pressure is second-hand, limiting upper band.</comment>

<comment>Eleanor’s call early + the wheel’s glint at midpoint teach the pattern and validate the Causal lens; the final bead-click turns story substance from rumor to filial duty. The decisive change lands—the vow is opened, truth released, Leo reconfigured from doubter to carrier. Cost is audible, tactile, and social: the click both exposes and risks the foreman’s family. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (gravel, rails, junction) are fixed by third sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The bead-encrusted valve wheel fulfills micro-setting gate: one specific object constrains every beat and is charged in the final image. Wet stone, rust, and cobalt glints are filtered through Leo’s mill-nerd priorities; peeling ads and twisted rails compress exposition into lived motion; spatial choreography holds across crawl and upright turn. Weather remains static but harmless here. Slight over-reliance on visual over sound/temperature keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—vindicate grand-father—is signaled immediately; pressure tightens when his personal safety of unbelief conflicts with tangible artifact (blue beads). The stakes move from reputational to moral once Leo feels the cold wheel and grasps that opening the valve will shame the foreman’s kin; options collapse into one audible click. Cost is visible on-page; the silent tunnel amplifies the social price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the inversion of haunting into mercy; no explicit thesis. The motif “ghost shift” is repriced: not spectral labor but collective silence forged to protect living families. Subtext operates in gesture—the tear through grime is wordless absolution. The ending image offers layered ambiguity: the click is both liberation and betrayal, lingering without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is strong: decay-moth phrasing, synesthetic “beads as frozen tears,” and headlamp-dictated sensory hierarchy maintain Leo’s explorer voice. Register stays inside his diction; no scholar intrusion. Slight cadence repetition—sentence openings cluster on noun/verb ticks—prevents 8.6. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean with high density: single sentences layer rust scent, foot placement, and thematic echo. No synonym loops; metaphors stay consistent (eyes, tears, prayer). One mixed metaphor—“hollow urgency…drawn like a moth to flame”—slightly blurs emotional texture. Final bead-click is clean, literal, and resonant; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar factory-accident frame is re-visioned through tactile rosary sabotage and survivor-imposed silence; bead ritual feels inevitable, not gimmick. Synthesis of industrial archaeology, radio-call folklore, and filial piety yields fresh angle. Specificity of cobalt glass against iron rescues the trope from generic haunting. Risk taken by abandoning traditional ghost payoff is paid by conceptual reprice at close.</comment>
