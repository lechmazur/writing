<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s interiority is stone-cold specific: “mineral tears traced paths through algae” embodies grief without labels. Contradictory impulses—the need to expose truth vs. fear of shattering the city—coexist in the same beats, driving every micro-choice. The final resolve to let the fracture sing costs him his own granite certainty, felt when “currents of change flowed through his own granite veins.” Full 9+ blocked only because no second character presses back, so status crucible is absent by scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the garden’s renewed pulse and Kael’s softened stone reconfigure meaning while the cost—his own permanence cracked—lingers. Causal chain holds: ampoule → fracture → spire sings → shame → resolve. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens drift. Single shard, one tightening, price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Heartstone Spire’s hairline fracture is not scenery; it dictates method and final image, constraining how Kael must deliver the serum. Underwater dome pressure is evoked through tactile kelp sway and mineral tears, never catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ampoule pressed to fracture, liquid seep, mandala silt—every object tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the city accept nuance instead of certainty?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when each revelation forecloses denial. Agency sits with Kael: dissolve ampoule, thread memory, accept own cracking. Cost is legible: his granite body becomes permeable. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the foxglove duality enacted in the spire: poison/medicine, certainty/nuance, fracture/song. Final image—garden breathing in “grateful rhythm”—reweights the premise without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; meaning is dramatized. Ambiguity lingers: the city may still choose rigidity, so complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person telepathic statue POV is stable, with diction chiseled to match: “incisively kind precision,” “stone-cold still.” Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause beats as glass dissolves—then widens into lyrical cadence for the choral close. No head-hop; psychic distance controlled. Filter verbs serve voice, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template runs. Metaphors are stone/ocean congruent, never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“revelation cascaded…revelation followed”) costs −0.2, but it occurs early and does not touch closure. High density: each line advances knowledge or image. Proofing is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Telepathic granite gardener wielding cardiac-architecture foxglove is inherently fresh, yet the piece grounds the conceit in hydraulic-organ mechanics and mnemonic biochemistry, making the surreal inevitable. The structural weakness as intentional humility device flips standard hero-fixes-flaw trope. Risky lyric accretion pays off in the final choral image.</comment>
