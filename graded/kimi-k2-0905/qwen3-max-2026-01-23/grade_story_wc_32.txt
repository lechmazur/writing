<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—docile apprentice vs. defiant creator—drives every micro-choice; the final vivification costs her seventy-three failures and frozen tears, anchoring change with felt price. “Stoically sensitive” is shown, not told, in her soot-stained surrender to listening. Only the bishop’s remembered voice feels external; no on-page elder applies live pressure, so status crucible is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken crozier reborn into living staff reweights “hopeless” to “tender of second chances,” cost crystallized in frost on her cheeks. Causal lens holds—each failed alloy logically feeds the final creative-destruction insight. Orientation anchored by word 40; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus’s paradoxical frozen embers constrain temperature choices, directly shaping her successive-approximation tactics; twilight’s thinning acts as permeable membrane that allows the final pulse. Micro-setting of the silver fragment itself becomes the crucible that charges the closing image. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold over sight—mirrors internal state without cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interrupt stifling destiny”—tightens when creative destruction reframes failure as fertile void, foreclosing repair-quest and forcing vivification. One meaningful escalation: surrender to listening replaces additive fixes with transformative melt. Cost legible in frost-burn knees and irrevocable abandonment of the bishop’s authority symbol.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through ruin emerges from silver vines crystallizing around frozen embers; no final moralizing, only image. Subtext of ecclesiastical disobedience lingers in the staff’s new living form, yet Elara never editorializes. Ambiguity remains: will cathedral elders accept or exile? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—soot, cinders, starlight alloys—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, fragments under surrender, then steadies with heartbeat pulse, mirroring melt/cool cycle. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived; narrative diction remains alchemical yet precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses of failure lists to crisp imperative “Show me your true shape,” then softens into liquid moonlight. No scaffold loops; each image advances state change. Minor purple patch—“paradoxical frozen bloom” repeated twice—deducts 0.2, but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemy trope is inverted: protagonist seeks not gold but autonomous life in a bishop’s crozier, fusing sacred authority with vegetative rebellion. Frozen-bloom ember nexus feels setting-specific, not generic fantasy forge. Risk of lyric overdrive is embraced yet controlled, yielding singular rather than templated vision.</comment>
