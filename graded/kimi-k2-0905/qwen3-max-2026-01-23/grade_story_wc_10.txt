<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s muteness is embodied through gesture and gaze; the fork-in-hand calibration of emotion to color shows micro-choices under pressure. Liam enters as mirror-trauma, but his arc is sketched more than dramatized—only one shared beat rewrites his stance. The earned cost is present: silence retained, connection forged without reclaiming noise. Missing a second turning beat from Liam keeps it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional pigment layers tighten until amber tear reweights silence into shared canvas. Orientation anchors within 50 words; single-scene shard from Elara’s dawn ritual to twilight covenant. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glass holds their song, foreclosing speech while making silence generative; cost visible in frost-melt fingerprints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: thermal sensitivity lets emotion become pigment, directly enabling the climax. Selective sensory triage—vibration in bone, color bloom, frost melt—keeps detail urgent and POV-bound. Conservatory’s rule-set is taught early and exploited at peak; no ornamental tourism. Tool-as-setting (tuning fork) also constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into witnessed music—signaled paragraph one. Single escalation: Liam’s magenta anguish forces Elara to test her chromatic lexicon on another; risk of re-triggering either survivor tightens the beat. Cost legible: shared tear and frost-melt patch externalize consequence. No secondary reversal, but one sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: communion possible without phonetic language. Motif of glass as non-verbal score deepens through color modulation and final amber bloom. Subtext operates in hand placement and color retreat rather than exposition. No moral tagged; resonance lingers in frost-free handprints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at Elara’s shoulder, filtering perception through tactile vibration and chromatic bias. Syntax lengthens in calm, fractures in magenta spikes, mirroring thermal swirls. Pronoun discipline clean; no head-hop. Voice resists sentimentality while preserving emotional amplitude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual payload—action + emotional hue—without scaffold. Metaphors (indigo grief, liquid gold peace) stay physically coherent inside glass logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances pigment or stakes. Read-aloud cadence modulates with color tempo; closure line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic alchemy and trauma recovery; tuning-fork-as-paintbrush not seen in slush. Concept stays integral, not ornamental. Could risk higher with sharper Liam counter-voice. Universality reached through specific thermal rule rather than generic “healing through art” trope.</comment>
