<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s vow and tactile reverence give her a clear, embodied motive that escalates to the decisive placement of the chip; the “beautician-mortician” duality is shown through ritual action rather than label. Interiority stays concrete—cooling skin, auroral light pooling—so emotion is never declared. The final tear of gratitude is earned because the cost (Kael’s death and her solitary vigil) has been dramatized. No contradictory impulse is staged, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip’s steady beacon makes the before/after legible—oblivion averted, continuity secured—and the cost is felt in the vial’s new weight. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (auroral hush, cooling skin, mandala snap) tightens the stake until the infusion beat. Orientation is anchored by word 34; no penalty applied. A single persistent constraint—the need to catch the exact threshold—shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s airborne stone and auroral arch are not backdrop; they dictate timing (auroral stillness = cue) and supply the literal platform for the ritual. Micro-setting—the obsidian bier, the silver veins—grounds the body and focuses Elara’s attention. Sensory selection favors emerald/violet wavelengths that mirror the chip, so description recycles into symbolism without overt statement. Environment charges the final image: the resumed aurora “bows,” externalizing the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture Kael’s essence before oblivion—is signaled in line 3 and tightens through sensory escalation rather than external opposition. The “threshold of stillness” acts as a live clock: missing it forecloses the option, visible in the mandala snap and auroral freeze. Agency is interiorized yet causal: Elara’s pattern-finding directly enables the infusion. Cost is legible in the vial’s added weight and her solitary descent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as defiance of entropy—emerges through the chip’s glow and the vial’s “personal galaxy,” never abstractly stated. Subtext resides in Elara’s silent tear: gratitude eclipses grief, implying vocation outweighs personal loss. The aurora’s bow externalizes cosmic acknowledgment without moralizing. Final image reweights the opening “radiant hush” into a hush now “imbued with completion,” a non-literal answer that satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter—galaxies in nerve impulses, snowflakes in breath—creating a distinct lyrical texture. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the ritual’s tempo, climaxing in the fragment “Then—the static… snapped.” No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within a star-weaver’s lexicon. The star-weavers’ whispered farewell is the only dialogue and carries subtext of continuance rather than goodbye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “sky congealed into ancient stone” packs state-change and age into six words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative chain (aurora → mandala → beacon) is coherent, never mixed. A single filter-verb cluster is absent; immediacy holds through tactile verbs—placed, channeled, traced—so the closure beat stays unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Beautician-mortician” and “star-weaver” collide into a fresh vocational cosmology where cosmic tapestry is embalmed by hand. The infusion ritual reverses typical soul-capture tropes: invitation replaces extraction, pattern-finding replaces force. Risk is taken with lyric stasis, yet the accumulative design pays off in the final beacon. Specificity of the emerald chip as slivered Heartstone prevents generic swap-out, making the invention feel inevitable.</comment>
