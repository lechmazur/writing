<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—“grim optimist”—is embodied in the compulsive climb and the chipped die she keeps rolling; every micro-choice (sharpen flint, etch, absorb the rupture instead of stepping through) flows from the same fused regret/hope engine. A visible cost is paid when she renounces egress and recommits to the stairs, proving the arc is earned. The only keep-away from 9 is slight over-articulation of her emotional summary at climax (“beauty persisted within broken systems”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: after self-authored proof fractures reality she consciously refuses escape, reweighting the staircase from prison to sanctuary; cost is legible in her enduring the same infinite climb now freighted with memory. The causal chain—die chip → regret anchor → theorem → rupture → renunciation—holds without gaps. One smooth time-step (present→memory→present) keeps orientation tight; no artifact obscures the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The staircase never becomes a white-room: haze, cool stone, pine smoke through the rupture, the tactile rasp of flint all tether attention to immediate sensory stakes. The chipped die functions as micro-setting that physically biases each roll and literalises “truth embraces imperfection,” directly charging the final image. At 8.7 because spatial anchoring during the rupture flash is briefly dreamlike; a half-breath more choreography would clinch 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the exact texture of missed opportunity—tightens once: the rupture offers the literal texture, she chooses verification over escape, paying the price of perpetual confinement. Pressure escalates Accumulative/Texturally: each etched symbol layers density until the air itself tears, a single decisive intensification. No external reversals are needed; the conflict is stance-vs-self. Cost is visible (she stays, climb continues forever) so 8.4; higher would require a second tactical twist within word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—mathematical longing as atonement—emerges through die, theorem, rupture, refusal, never once sermonized. The ending reconfigures meaning: infinity is not endless failure but a canvas for honoring loss. Subtext of forgiveness is hinted in the new proof begun, letting readers feel the after-waves rather than being told them. No abstract slogans intrude; the only near-slip is the phrase “beautiful, human fragility,” but it is saved by its placement beside the physically biased die.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a mathematician’s perceptual signature—abstraction married to tactile precision (“balancedly daring resolve,” “rigorous calculus and topology”). Rhythm flexes with climb cadence, then compresses during the rupture without syntactic loop. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through Elara’s regret-calibrated attention. Voice remains distinct under pressure, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, lyric when emotion peaks yet avoids purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new texture or advances theorem-as-ritual. Mixed metaphors are absent; “pearlescent haze” and “rupture with a sound like shattering glass” coexist without physics clash. Closing cadence—dice click, next proof begun—gives a crisp exhale that recharges the motif perfectly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Merging regret-driven maths with an infinite stairworld feels fresh; the perpetual-motion paradox is literalized as emotional stasis. The chipped die as both flaw and compass is a specific, non-exchangeable innovation. Risk in the math/philosophy hybrid pays off because every abstract term is yoked to sensory memory. Not 9+ only because “infinite staircase” carries residual mythic familiarity, slightly softening the shock of newness.</comment>
