<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s jitter-to-calm arc is embodied through trembling hands, the pendant clutch, and final steady stride; the interior contradiction between duty and wonder is dramatized, not declared. Cost is visible: the luminous plant roots in the spot where his grief once sat. Missing micro-choice under midsentence pressure keeps it from 9—he never actively decides to vibrate, the pendant does it for him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ridgeway itself is re-priced from dead routine to corridor of possibility, cost legible in frozen tears and the glowing plant he leaves behind. Causal chain holds—pendant’s warmth → vibration → seed exposure → germination → purpose revival—though the final beat is slightly gift-wrapped by the artifact rather than a conscious toggle. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via aurora weave and cadence shift at plant birth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost-rimed granite, aurora rivers, and the pendant’s glass wings are filtered through Kael’s courier gaze—every detail either chills or reassures. The ridgeway’s cold stone literally cracks to release the seed, so environment constrains and enables the final image. One sentence of tourist-catalog color could be trimmed, but micro-setting (pendant against chest) functions as lived geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can wonder survive Elara’s absence?”—tightens when memory shifts from private ache to shared legend; options narrow from carrying crates to carrying possibility. Pressure escalates via texture: silence → scent → warmth → hum → crack → glow. The cost is the irreversible exposure of the seed and his own transformed identity; no reversal, only deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory must be externalized to become myth, yet the act demands personal surrender. Subtext hums in the pendant’s low resonance—listening when he cannot—so the final plant is the literalized echo of Elara’s lesson. No moralizing, only image; the line “no longer merely a courier of relics, but a living courier of wonder” risks echoing prompt language, shaving 0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s body and lexicon; perceptual signature is tactile—“crunched,” “cool glass,” “frozen tears.” Syntax lengthens under aurora awe, then fractures into short clauses at germination, mirroring heartbeat. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the one adverb “quietly” is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence openings, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops; information density high—“barren earth scarred by frost began to tremble” does three jobs in nine words. Two adjacent “luminous” tags in final third slightly dull the shine, but no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates perfectly with plant growth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “memory-to-myth” germination is a fresh twist on the mentor-talisman trope; vibrating pendant as tuning fork to dormant seed feels specific to this world. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation rather than twist—but the synthesis of aurora, courier routine, and living myth is memorable. Could push further into strangeness, yet what’s here is already inseparable from Kael.</comment>
