<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her olfactory gift drives every beat and the final renunciation feels earned. The contradiction between ambition and olfactory revulsion is held in scene, not summarized. No secondary character appears, so relationship tests are waived. Cost is visible in the moment she accepts the future stench as “honest story.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each daily micro-beat tightens the stake until the shoot’s emergence reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts the plant’s full spectrum, foreclosing the path of avoidance with felt cost. The doodled wrapping paper anchors generational causality and returns inside the journal, paying off the setup. Word-count brackets are extraneous scaffolding but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is evoked through motion—bridges sway, moss-clung homes—rather than static postcarding. Olfactory detail dominates, filtering world-building through POV priority. The balcony pot functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across 19 beats; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she endure the corpse flower’s future reek to claim its healing power?—is signaled in seed beat and escalates through daily sensory micro-tests. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent under accumulative lens. One visible cost: she accepts the stench as “honest story,” narrowing her future options. Could edge higher if an external consequence (village scorn, lost clientele) had been dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: serenity is not conquered but harmonized through daily motion. The doodle motif shifts from silent prayer to final visible credo without authorial nudge. Final image reweights prior material—stench becomes teacher, not obstacle. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the bloom will actually cost her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s olfactory angle; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent. Sentence rhythm breathes with ritual repetition (“watering, watching, waiting”) that is pattern-taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice tests default to narrative texture. Lexicon remains within herbalist’s plausible range; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (action + sensory filter + emotional tilt). Occasional modifier stacks (“subterranean whispers—a shift in moisture, a faint metabolic sigh”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful under lyric accumulative mode. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Word-count brackets are extraneous but treated as non-textual artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corpse-flower cultivation as spiritual discipline feels fresh, not trope-reliant. Doodles-as-inheritance device particularizes the village culture without exposition dump. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric arc rather than twist—but coherence rewards the choice. Could push higher if the bloom’s social consequences inside the canopy had been seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambition is dramatized in the initial seed acceptance and tempered through every daily micro-choice; final serenity is earned renunciation, not given.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Seed handled in planting, soil blending, scent detection, and final acceptance; meaning reweights from threat to teacher, charging closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Undercurrent surfaces via doodles, elders’ nods, forest rhythm; it guides her stance shift but never dictates action—organic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Olfactory gift constrains every beat—she leans close, detects metabolic sigh, braces for future stench; cost is visceral and continuous.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Journalizing tracks subterranean changes and houses final doodle; without it the arc of attention collapses—causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Custom taught early on wrapping paper, reappears pressed inside journal; mechanics root generational wisdom but do not alter mid-scene tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Treetop village supplies rope-bridge motion and dawn-gilded canopy, shaping stillness-in-motion theme, yet no resource or social pressure turns the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tide-turn celestial cue frames opening but functions as atmospheric clock rather than decision timer; time remains elastic across weeks.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Serenity-through-motion desire is stated, tested by daily ritual, and achieved via acceptance; friction between want and feared stench drives every beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Wildflower hush modulates from ambient blanket to resonant chord after bloom acceptance; tone shifts with internal reweighting, charging final image.</comment>
