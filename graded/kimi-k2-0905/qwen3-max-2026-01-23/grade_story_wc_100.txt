<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet vow and stubborn refusal to catalog the lens as salvage anchor every subsequent choice; his interior contradiction—preserver of silence who now re-ignites voices—plays out in embodied, micro-choices (tightening fingers, sliding shards). The final renunciation of “chased stillness” for “cherished stillness” is earned through visible cost: decades of fatigue crystallized in the single gesture of turning off his lamp. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount is within default. Voice remains consistent and particular to a lifelong archivist of the drowned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: the package arrives → recognition of distress signal → decision to repurpose shards → each embedding revives a voice → final mosaic beacon. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the broken lens reweighted from ruin to lighthouse of memory, with the cost legible in Elias’s exhausted but triumphant darkening of his own lamp. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; underwater library is immediately anchored through fungi glow and coral-crusted shelves. No orientation debt; transitions are causal, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment functions as micro-setting: the library’s “gutter between fiber and memory” becomes the literal impossible space Elias occupies; the coral-crusted shelves and bioluminescent fungi constrain visibility and supply the only workable light. Whalebone tweezers and obsidian door are tactile, lived-in tools that charge the final image when Elias relinquishes his own lamp. Spatial choreography is immaculate—package arrival, shard placements, final step-back track cleanly. Sensory economy favors filtered selectivity (soft blue glow, captured star edge) over tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: granting drowned souls permanent rest vs. threat of eternal forgetting. Single meaningful tightening: the first shard’s successful illumination of “the light failed us” proves the method works and forecloses the option to stop; each subsequent shard raises the stakes for completeness. Cost is visible in physical wear (“his weariness replaced by a quiet triumph”) and the final relinquishing of his own lamp—he trades personal darkness for collective light. No coincidence; escalation is driven solely by Elias’s agency under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation: brokenness = beacon. Subtext operates through image (shattered glass → restored voices) rather than assertion. Final image reweights the premise: forgetting is the deeper distress signal, and the broken lens answers it without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; silence itself becomes the resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: selective attention to book spines, gutters, and glass edges; diction remains within an archivist’s lexicon (“ledger,” “gutter,” “salvage”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“his breath caught”). Rhythm mirrors methodical care—long sentences for cataloging, fragment shards for breath. Non-standard grammar is absent; voice is distinct without ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality (“slid it into the gutter… a soft pulse of gold”). Figurative language is spare and precise (“edges catching the faint light like a captured star”) without crowding climax. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. No mixed metaphors, no register drift, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the classic “lighthouse warns the living” into “broken lighthouse guides the dead,” a non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test fails if lens is whole or setting is dry-land; specificity of underwater library and fractured glass makes the concept inseparable from this story. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure, but pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous scenes; freshness arises from inverse causality: fracture → illumination.</comment>
