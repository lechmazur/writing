<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—ruthless empiricist vs. grieving granddaughter—coexist in the same beats (“gloomy cheerfulness”), and her micro-choice to retell the past with the cello visibly tilts her hierarchy of values. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of permanent truth for the ache of transient love. The only restraint from 9-band is that the internal shift is almost entirely interior; no external behavior (posture, breath-rate, grip) varies to dramatize the final relinquishment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass is revealed to be the act of remembrance itself, and the price is the surrender of her lifelong myth-busting identity (“truth must be permanent”). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each cello hum layers density until meaning reweights. The painted shell’s warming is a taught pattern that pays off in the final image. Cost is unmistakable in the phrase “some truths are too tender for debunking,” foreclosing her former methodology.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Observatory, cliff wind, and salt scent are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze (“clinical precision”) and anchor every beat; the half-finished cello acts as micro-setting that literally channels vibration into choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—shell in palm, bow drawn, floorboards vibrating—tracking body and object without drift. The environment never constrains a second option or threat, so the 9-band gate is just missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—decode the compass or remain haunted—tightens when the cello hum forces her to trade empirical proof for emotional resonance. One meaningful deepening occurs: retelling the memory narrows her options from “solve” to “cherish,” with visible cost (tears, relinquished quest). Under Accumulative lens, pressure is coherent; no external antagonist is needed. The price is felt, but not persistent—no future tactic is altered—so 8.8+ is withheld.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: love as the only compass that points true while you remember. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the shell on raw wood wordlessly asserts that beauty thrives in incompleteness. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. A hairline slip toward epigram in “geography of the heart” keeps it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—“salt-tinged breath,” “cinematic clarity”—with rhythmic compression matching emotional surge. No head-hopping; psychic distance deliberately narrows during the hum. Distinct syntax—“gloomy cheerfulness,” “quiet companion”—creates memorable texture. One clause of slightly elevated abstraction (“universal riddle”) is within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“note of gratitude hung in the twilight.” Sentence rhythm modulates naturally, accelerating under pressure. A single near-filter verb (“felt the irony settle”) is too minor to cap the band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—myth-buster undone by a myth she re-creates herself—is fresh, and the half-finished cello as memory-conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Details are specific to this voice and setting. Risk is moderate; the concept could travel with different names, but the emotional specificity anchors it. No bold formal gamble is attempted, so 8.8+ is not reached.</comment>
