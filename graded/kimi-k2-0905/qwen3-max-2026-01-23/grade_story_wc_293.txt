<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the bridge’s loss versus embracing fragmentation—surface only in abstract summary; the bow-on-strings moment is too brief to dramatize a costly, specific choice. Interiority is vivid (“luminous disbelief”) but drifts toward label-speak. The arc lands as renunciation, yet the cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new song crystallizes his stance, glass flake on strings reweights the premise, and the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 34; no penalty applies. One minor scaffold: “scaffold wrap flutters” is repeated with identical phrasing three times, but never at the climax, so the closure beat remains untouched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The alpine pullout is sketched with spare, POV-filtered detail—wind, dust, ozone, distant scaffolding—each note chosen to mirror Elias’s inner fracture. The glass flake serves as micro-setting that finally constrains the bow-stroke decision. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. While broader geography is thin, the mountain pass and construction site supply all the pressure required at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can music resurrect a dream pronounced “never”?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulating images: vanishing hitchhiker, glowing cracks, scaffold code. The tightening beat is the bow’s first note: it forecloses silence and costs him the safety of grief. Cost is felt but not given concrete consequence (no broken string, no audience rejection), keeping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—creation redeems fragmentation—emerges via the glass flake’s reprise on the strings, not thesis. Subtext lives in the scaffold’s silent dance: potential hidden inside ruin. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. One soft echo: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” is stated twice; trimming one would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “dynamically observant” is shown through selective noticing of dust, ozone, flutter rhythms. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath, mirroring fiddle phrasing. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive without mannerism; ready for publication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic, compressed, high-density; every sentence advances image or stake. Minor loop: “scaffold wrap flutters” exact phrase recurs three times; still, it never clutters the climax. Metaphors stay coherent (glass cracks = luminous pathways). Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding beyond that repeated collocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing wet-plate photography, pixel metaphor, and scaffold-code music is fresh; the hitchhiker-angel trope is familiar but transformed through Elias’s sensorial filter. Risk lies in the lyric-accumulative structure; it pays off via the charged final image. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
