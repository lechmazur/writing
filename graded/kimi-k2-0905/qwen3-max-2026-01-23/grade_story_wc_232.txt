<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s empirically intuitive trait is shown, not told, and his shift from skepticism to belief is embodied in the ant-tracking choice; the final renunciation of loneliness carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat of “tears blurred his vision” drifts toward label. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (mentor vow > personal safety) is legible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chip glimmer → coordinates → cave → ants → doorway; each step compresses options and the creek clock tightens. Closure is a Charged Poise: stepping through is unnecessary because the decision itself reconfigures meaning—“the choice to believe” paid for by rising water and mentor memory. Cost is on-page in the cooled, inert chip and the receding storm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-filtered (map-dealer notices micro-coordinates, lichen patterns, ant column trajectory). The blooming cavern’s bioluminescence and wisteria curtain constrain visibility and force the ant method, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the willow-root architecture is sketched broadly, but it still gates the decision moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“honor the promise before the creek swells”—is signaled early and escalates through water seeping into boots, narrowing passages, and time collapsing to “tightening coil.” The ant-guided ramp is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses every other route. Felt price is the soaked boots and the irreversible transfer of chip energy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: empirical observation can coexist with, and even deliver, wonder. No character states it; it’s enacted when ant science becomes mystical doorway. The final image of town “washed clean” reweights the opening loneliness without moralizing. One hairline slip: “profound peace” edges toward abstraction, but Aris’s presence stays non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with map-dealer perceptual signature—coordinates, linen scent, petroglyph line weights. Syntax lengthens for cavern awe, shortens for rising water, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so no register drift. The lyric final sentence earns its lift via prior concrete ant imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete nouns or strong verbs, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“constellations across damp walls”). One scaffold loop: “the creek’s roar escalated; cold water seeped…” restates threat in adjacent lines—minor, outside closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing mycological cavern, typographic relic, and myrmecology into a quest narrative feels fresh; the ant method subverts standard clue tropes. Mentor vow + chip + ant tracker could tip into quirky overload, but each element is grounded in sensory choice. Transformation test passes: swap elements and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
