<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—shame-driven quiet versus the need to be heard—stay active in-scene; the micro-choice to place the lattice over the scuffs crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him the last of his anonymity. Twenty-year patience feels lived-in; the tear on Elias’s cheek is the on-page proof of absolution. Interiority avoids label-speak; “legacy of lies clinging to his name like salt-rime” is embodied, not diagnostic. Final grip of absolution is earned, not gifted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam copper-washes the lattice and the two men share an undeniable conceptual cost—“God forgive us”—that reweights every prior scuff. Causal chain holds: lattice acts as aperture because Kael’s salvaging was reported earlier; Elias’s belief is forced by literal eyewitness, not convenience. Orientation anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “the hush Kael chased settled” is a touch expository, but it lands inside the final image and does not blunt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Copperlight, salt-rime, stone seams, moth-wing glints—details are filtered through Kael’s stone-worn fingertip and lighthouse keeper’s eye. The reef and tower are not backdrop but constraint: the narrow door’s scuffs literally guide the lattice placement that exposes bodies. Micro-setting succeeds: the lattice’s carved saints and the beam’s rotation are tactile tools that charge the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will anyone finally see the truth—signals early and tightens once: Elias’s eyewitness through the lattice forecloses the “liar’s son” excuse forever. Agency sits with Kael’s decision to show, not shout; cost is Elias’s tear and the dawn exhumation they now must perform. No coincidence; pressure grows under causal lens. Sufficient for length, but a second tightening beat (e.g., risk of being caught setting the lattice) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—silence as the place where understanding begins—emerges through image (moth hovering in beam) and gesture (hand on shoulder), never thesis. Copperlight repose reprises with new moral weight after the bodies are acknowledged. Subtext in Elias’s single tear carries more than any confession. Final image resists moralizing; the reef “breathes a single, shared truth” leaves ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s perceptual signature—stone-smooth fingertip, salt-rime, copperlight—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for breath-held hush, fragments (“Since the collapse”) under pressure. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic, goal-driven: “Another phantom, Kael?” condenses decades of doubt. No head-hopping; Elias’s interior is read only through Kael’s eye and exterior cues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: “jagged teeth of Serpent’s Reef,” “bruised horizon,” “copperlight repose”—alliteration serves lighthouse hum. Information density high; single sentences layer time, legacy, and texture. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold clause—“the impossibility the prison sustained”—is efficient, not redundant. Opening and closing lines bookend with identical cadence tightened by meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Inversion of “boy who cried wolf” into a quiet man who shows truth through a salvaged confessional lattice is fresh; never seen this exact secular transubstantiation. Reef prison hiding bodies logged “lost at sea” twists familiar maritime ghost-story into institutional cover-up. Specificity anchors risk: moth as witness, copperlight as moral wash. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into trope comfort zone.</comment>
