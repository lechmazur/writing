<comment>Elara’s “interpreting silence with empathy” motive is concrete in every beat—she digitizes reels, overlays shadows, refuses to publish loudly—so the renunciation at the end carries felt cost. Interiority stays sensory (“rain-scoured fresco vault,” “softened into reverence”) rather than diagnostic. The only gap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; head-count itself is not penalised. Micro-choices (leaving the vault unchanged, packing tools with reverence) crystallise her hierarchy of values, earning the quiet closure.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-build through juxtaposed footage and rain-erosion imagery that reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“subterranean chamber…”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final drip of rainwater on the window reconfigures the vault from sealed mystery to honoured partner, cost paid in her refusal to excavate or publicise. Causality holds because the 1954-shadow → star-alignment discovery is driven solely by her archival labour, not coincidence.</comment>

<comment>Rain-soaked limestone, 1723 map fibres, and video grain are filtered through Elara’s restorer-eye; each sensory pick serves the stake of “listen, don’t conquer.” The vault itself constrains her choice—its damp silence dictates quiet tools, no crowds, and the final decision to leave it untouched. Spatial choreography is clean: map on oak table → fresco east wall → window drip, all trackable. One minor slip: “central altar stone” is mentioned without prior spatial set-up, a hairline orientation blink that does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—protect the silence of sacred space—tightens when the shadow alignment proves the vault is an active instrument, raising the risk of exposure. Escalation is textural: each overlay of footage increases the density of rain/erosion imagery until the vault’s living status becomes undeniable. The visible price is her renunciation of louder fame; she forecloses that path by choosing “publish quietly,” a stance crystallisation under situational pressure. No coincidence resolves the tension; the 1989 shadow’s shorter fall is already documented in her notes, so agency remains hers.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from erosion itself—knowledge surrendered to time deserves empathy, not conquest. The returning image of rain tracing “new paths down ancient stone” reweights the tear in the map from damage to threshold, achieving resonance without moralising. Subtext operates in gesture: leaving the vault unchanged is louder than any manifesto. Complexity is honoured—the builders’ intent is inferred but never reduced to a slogan, inviting counter-readings about stewardship vs. secrecy.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual signature: vellum ghost-rivers, video static as memory surfacing. Syntax lengthens under reverence, then tightens into micro-fragments (“A soft breath escaped her, instantly absorbed”) mirroring the hush. No head-hopping; diction stays within a restorer’s lexicon without academic drift. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice distinctiveness rests on the lyrical but precise descriptive cadence, which holds under pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 5-word breath-units to 40-word layered clauses that echo rain-patter rhythm; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (shadow as dark arrow, stains as sentences) stay consistent with cartographic/astronomic logic—no mixed vehicles. Information is dense: one sentence locates the vault, dates the map, and signals the tear’s thematic role. Only one paraphrase loop: “silence…whispered…quiet” cluster mid-paragraph; isolated, does not dull closure image.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival forensics with sacred acoustics feels non-obvious yet inevitable: the vault’s dripping geometry is revealed as an astronomical instrument, a synthesis not seen in common henge lore. Risk lies in the near-lyric, low-action form, but the choice pays off when the final rain-drop reconfigures both map and mission. Specificity—1723 surveyor’s ink, 4:18 PM solstice shadow—anchors the concept in verifiable detail, preventing abstraction. The tear-as-threshold reframes conservation ethics without sermon, achieving fresh inflection.</comment>
