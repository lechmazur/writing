<comment>Elias’s grief-anchored interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial-cork ritual crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Silas’s single-scene reversal from bluster to tearful awe is credible because the scent-triggered vision is staged as an involuntary sensory blow, not persuasion. The micro-choice to ease the cork rather than blast the horn visibly forecloses Elias’s prior silence and re-configures their professional dynamic. Cost is felt: Elias’s trembling fingers and Silas’s stripped voice show the moment’s emotional price.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whispered scent reweights the keepers’ creed from “shout” to “whisper” with conceptual cost—Silas’s forty-year identity is overturned on-page. Causal chain holds: vial → cork → scent → shared vision → status shift. Orientation is anchored by word 84; no penalty. Single shard, single POV, one tightening beat satisfies 600–800 scope. Persistent constraint: the depleted vial now corked again implies future silence, shaping tactics.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt tower, salt-slick iron, and dew-cerulean paint are selective and POV-filtered. The cliff-path’s geography is stable; spatial choreography of two bodies on a narrow walkway is clean. The vial operates as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its cool glass anchors tactile immediacy. Weather shift from heat wave to rinsed dawn mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled early and tested once: the scent’s arrival in Silas’s tea-kettle memory tightens the stake by validating the theory with witnessed cost (Silas’s tears, audible hush). No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening sufficient. Agency lies in Elias’s controlled release, not external rescue. Coincidence is absent; the transmission succeeds through causality of wind and olfaction.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: gentleness as transmissive force versus coercive volume. Subtext resides in sensory substitution—smell replacing sound—rendered without thematic lecture. Final image of fishing boat guided by “gentle beam and memory of a whisper” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: Silas’s awe contains humiliation, Elias’s victory tastes of private loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“calloused fingers,” “screaming tenderness”—is character-specific and rhythmic. Compression in the two-line dialogue exchange is purposeful, taught by prior lyrical density. Free-indirect texture stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective: “cerulean sentinel,” “bruised purple dawn”—three metaphors in 350 words, not overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor adjective clustering (“cool salt-tinged air”) does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—olfactory telegraph of grief across a lighthouse—is fresh yet internally logical. Transformation test fails if relocated to inland setting, confirming specificity. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off with earned resonance. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
