<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the cracked-bookmark micro-choice at the fracture beat cleanly tilts her renunciation. The glass-work narration externalizes contradictory impulses (perfectionism vs acceptance) without therapy-speak. Final “abandon” lands with felt cost: she forfeits hours of labor and ego investment. Voice-specific perceptual signature sustains across the single POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared early via drip-drip motif and torch rhythm; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—flawed bookmark under dome reweights “broken = more light.” One shard, no teleporting props; hairline fracture is taught causal trigger. Cost is visible: scrapped vessel + bookmark repositioning. Orientation anchored by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Control-room micro-setting (frost, viewport, console) constrains tool use and mirrors thaw; propane torch and marver act as body-proximate setting that gates every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy filtered through glassblower priorities—temperature, viscosity, color—never catalog. Spatial choreography clean across marver, annealer, scrap bin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a safe zone be built that does not distort truth—tightens once: perfect vessel fails → must embrace flaw. Escalation is density/cadence shift under Accumulative lens: drip → fracture → rainbow refraction. Protagonist agency drives the turn (she carries piece to bin). Price paid: lost time, material, ego; new aesthetic rule set.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: fracture→light, not statement. Bookmark reprise and dome refract prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity survives—will the neighbors actually return? Emotional aftereffect carried by image, not assertion. No thematic echo violation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; glassblower lexicon accurate (marver, gather, anneal). Narrative voice modulates from ceremonial declamation to quiet release, tracking interior thaw. Syntax mirrors heat cycle: long rolling sentences during gather, shorter beats at fracture. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with furnace cycle; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (liquid dawn, steel gloom) are sparse, taught early, paid off. High density: “From error, wisdom is forged” compresses arc. Clean grammar, precise tool terminology, zero scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-climate ice-station glassblower is fresh; ritual self-narration as thermal discipline deepens vocation. Fractured bookmark → light mosaic transforms familiar trope into specific aesthetic rule. Risk of lyric vessel-as-heart is fully committed without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
