<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and Samuel’s posthumous directive drive every beat; the micro-choice to seek Horvath is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays concrete—“weight a physical echo,” “tears traced clean paths”—without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of guilt-as-debt is earned because the prior repair beat visibly forecloses self-punishment and re-purposes his vocation. Only minor cap: we never see Elias make an actual mistake in prison; the flaw is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because first repairer condemns the heart → therefore Elias seeks Horvath; because Horvath finds a fracture → therefore the heart sings; because it sings → therefore Elias reframes his mission. Each link tightens options and culminates in an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias leaves with “renewed purpose” and the literal pulse of the box against his chest—cost made visible. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; the mainspring remains the same object throughout. Closure beat satisfies 9+ cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shop is rendered through sensory triage—lemon oil, slanted light, rain lashing glass—each detail filtering Elias’s penitentiary-honed attention to penance. The bench-top micro-setting functions as crucible: the fracture is spotted only when storm-light strikes, so environment directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography is spotless; box passes cleanly from lap to Horvath’s hands to chest. Meets 9+ gate: the repaired clockwork heart in the final image physically constrains Elias’s next steps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias convert guilt into restorative action—tightens once: from “debt to repay” to “seed to nurture.” The fracture discovery is the single escalation that flips his possible futures; the melody of “Amazing Grace” audibly forecloses wallowing and commits him to prison ministry. Cost is legible on-page: he accepts undeserved mercy, a stance that will expose him to further sorrow inside the walls. No reversal inflation; one meaningful turn suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive second-seeing emerges through the repaired heart’s objective fate, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: soldered brass becomes absolution Elias cannot earn but must carry. Final image reweights the premise—apology is not currency but fertile substrate—without declaring a moral. Resonance is particularized to Samuel’s clockwork organ, resisting generic uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person stays latched to Elias’s perceptual filter: gnarled hands, magnified eyes, sudden gold shaft feel like his guilty hyper-focus. Syntax lengthens under awe (“the world reduced to grey despair…”) then contracts into purpose (“He would turn apology…”), mirroring cardiac rhythm. No head-hop; Horvath’s interior is implied only through Elias’s reading of breath and voice. Distinctive ecclesiastical diction—“sacred relic,” “resonant reconfiguration”—yet never drifts into purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines multi-task: “dust motes drifted like silent prayers” sets atmosphere and Elias’s vocation in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“vibrant hush”), and paid off when hush shatters into melody. Only hairline slip: “aptly deliberate” appears twice, a micro-echo that nicks variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as metonym for incarcerated humanity feels fresh; the object literally embodies Samuel’s twenty-year sentence. Second-opinion mechanic reframes prison-reform argument into tactile repair scene, avoiding policy speech. Risk-taking is present—lyric accumulation inside a single shop—but coherence holds. Could edge higher if Samuel’s voice had been individualized beyond one quotation.</comment>
