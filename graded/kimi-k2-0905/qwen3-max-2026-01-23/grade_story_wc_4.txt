<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-archivist persona is vivid and consistent; her interiority filters every beat. The micro-choice to show Liam the laughing-women photo crystallizes her method and costs her nothing, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible. No contradictory impulse or personal stake is risked, so the “puzzle” trait remains decorative. Still, the town’s healing is legibly tied to her orchestration, satisfying the length’s scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the empty map-case + firefly arcs reweight the factory from wound to commons. Accumulative lens holds: each Tuesday session layers density until the gallery wall reframes meaning. The single causal tightening (Liam’s tear) is sufficient for this lyric design. Cost is felt in the relinquished case and the vanished roar—both on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender scent and vine growth evolve with the emotional cadence; the climbing ivy mirrors the climbing arcs, charging the final image. The factory ruin anchors every move without exposition dump. Micro-setting—the softening leather case—functions as tactile memory tool. Spatial choreography stays clean even when the crowd expands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“transmute pain into shared masterpiece”—is signaled early and deepens through each restored photo. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is accretive consensus. The visible price is the archive’s relinquishment and the erosion of bitterness in real time. One meaningful tightening: Liam’s tear shifts community uptake from skeptic to participation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating arcs rather than commentary: connectivity > loss. Final image of fireflies tracing their own arcs offers non-literal reprise without moralizing. Subtext in silence—Elara never defends the factory, only redirects gaze—keeps complexity alive. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: “softened by decades of handling and hopeful touches.” Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic lavender breeze, then clips when teenagers arrive. No head-hop; collective “they” at end reads as externalized culmination of her vision. Distinct rhythmic signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with crowd size; paragraph lengths visually swell like gathering townsfolk. No scaffold or synonym loops; “arc” recurs with reweighted meaning each time. Metaphors stay vegetal and textile, coherent to world. One strained phrase—“earnest whimsy of fireflies”—is forgiven in closure glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Healing-through-archive is familiar, but the silver-arc overlay and communal gallery on rusted wall feel specific and inevitable. Transformation test fails: names could swap, yet the vegetal reclamation + photo arcs would still root the piece. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but executed with conviction. Freshness lives in sensory pairing of lavender and oxidized iron.</comment>
