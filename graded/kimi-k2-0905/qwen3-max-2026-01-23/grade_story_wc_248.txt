<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—analytical arsonist turned tender archivist—are dramatized through the tactile handling of each artifact; the final copy-action shows a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the sister-memory is slightly over-articulated (“Even scars can sing”) and flirts with diagnostic speak, keeping it under 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the humming of scar-notation converts violation into song, releasing the Canticle with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—each art piece is a because/therefore step—and the vandalized portrait encodes the melody that only the arsonist’s past can unlock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive’s dust, collapsed shelves, and moonlit basalt constrain movement and attention; the tapestry fragment operates as micro-setting that guides choice. Environment never feels like backdrop—each object’s placement pressures the next discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the valley or fail Elara—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the scar-notation forces a public act of song. One meaningful deepening: the act of “portray” shifts from self-image to sonic revelation, foreclosing anonymity with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of fire→song; liberation is redefined from burning cages to scar-etched preservation. Final image of copying the Canticle offers a non-literal answer: redemption is inscription, not ignition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“analytically intuitive mind,” “volcanic tenderness”—threads every observation; syntax mirrors the tension between calculation and awe. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, backstory cue, and forward motion. Zero loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates through the corridor sequence and breathes at the reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-as-archivist navigates a trail of art-objects whose vandalism is the encoding method. Risky premise is fully committed to—no retreat into generic treasure hunt—and the scar-music payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
