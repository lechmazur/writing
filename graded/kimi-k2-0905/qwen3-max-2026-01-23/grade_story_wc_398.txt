<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-root metaphor and micro-choice to hand over the relic land cleanly; Clara and Liam’s silent shift from rigidity to hand-drift is credible, but their interiority is filtered through Elara’s lyricism, blurring contradictory impulses in-scene and capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the burned edge becomes compass, couple chooses to walk to cottage, Elara re-weights her solitude as bridge; cost is felt in her lingering alone. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural—pattern of vine/graft parallels tighten until final image recharges them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber glow on cedar, gnarled rootstock embracing Viognier, burned paper edge—each object is tactile, POV-filtered, and re-appears at closure to reconfigure meaning; vineyard slope spatially orients the station below, satisfying micro-setting test without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can this mismatch endure?—is signaled early; single deepening occurs when Elara’s parallel reveals silence ≠ distance, narrowing options from leave/stay to stay/tend; cost legible in relinquished bus and Elara’s renewed solitude, but escalation is one-note lyric repetition rather than rising tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vine graft image and burned paper: fragility+strength yields complex wine; no overt moralizing—final “invitation to tend what remains” reweights prior fire-loss into quiet hope, achieving resonance without tidy aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays anchored in Elara’s perceptual lattice (“roots seeking water,” “rustle of crimson leaves”) without head-hop; cadence modulates from dusk hush to star-pricked silence, maintaining rhythmic control and a singular atmospheric signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—each sentence layers sensory/figurative work; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; occasional elevated phrasing (“liquid honey,” “indelible geometry”) flirts with excess but remains within Elara’s meditative register and never muddles closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vineyard-as-couples-therapy is familiar, but Elara’s relic of her own burned love letter and the Cabernet/Viognier graft as living mismatch feel particular; risk is quiet rather than bold, yet specificity lifts the premise above self-help trope.</comment>
