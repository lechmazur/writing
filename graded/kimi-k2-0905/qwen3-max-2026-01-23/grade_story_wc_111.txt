<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—veined hands, soil-over-silicon creed, marble ritual—yet her one on-page decision (pressing the cobalt sphere) is causally thin; Kael’s panic does the heavy lifting. The final vow lands as earned stasis, but the contradictory impulse (risk expulsion vs. protect garden) is asserted rather than dramatized in her body. Still, the specificity of cracked-glass chronicles and breath-synced polish keeps her above stock sage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s thorn-gate crystallizes the cost of Kael’s worldview and reweights Elara’s “mended deception” premise. Causal linkage holds—marble pressed, thorns withdraw, luck meter cracks—yet the garden’s agency is external, so the decisive change feels shared rather than protagonist-driven. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The maze operates as micro-setting: leaf-shaped niche, yew hedge, phoenix vine constrain Elara’s tactical choice of which marble to press. Sensory triage—jasmine/clematis, damp earth, cereus—mirrors life/decay dialectic without cataloging. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly when Kael steps forward and the path seals; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reciprocity vs. quantified luck—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the meter drops Kael to 0.4%. The reversal is garden-driven, not Elara’s escalation, so agency feels diffused, but the visible price (cracked meter, thorn encirclement) is legible and forecloses his metric certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shifting valence of “crack”: from societal failure to illuminated history. Final image—constellation of marbles glowing in hedge—offers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s cough and retreat carries the class critique; no thesis statement in closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—ancient-root veins, soil scent, wax warmed by friction. Syntax lengthens during polish ritual, then shortens under Kael’s intrusion, mirroring threat. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “emerald curtain,” “maps of veins,” “mending the lie” all serve dual sensory/thematic duty. No synonym loops; only one near-paraphrase (“withered by decades… purpose bloomed”) but it charges the final cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines quantified-luck dystopia with cracked-glass devotional in a way that feels inevitable once planted. The maze as moral lie-detector is fresh; no prior echo detected. Risk is moderate—externalized garden agency—but specificity of marble fractures and covenant with soil keeps it from gimmick.</comment>
