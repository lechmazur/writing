<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s exile, tactile ritual with the stone, and refusal to weaponise chess cohere into a believable interior. His “discipline forged in royal chambers” externalises as micro-choices—rooted boots, thumb tracing the dent—that embody the thirty-year pressure; the final turn east is earned because the nexus translation dramatises how principled silence now directs him. Only a hairline slip: the tear-and-dust image edges toward performed emblem rather than raw fracture, keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (magnetic pulse, cooling-stone chime) thickens until the plateau hush crystallises Elias’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the dent…a compass pointing toward integrity”—that reconfigures exile from shame to purpose; cost is the foregone court life, felt in “sorrow of lost students.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. Slight over-reliance on lyric summary in final paragraph prevents 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The nexus is not backdrop but instrument: magnetic spikes cue memory flashes, basalt monoliths echo the worry-stone’s iron, twilight colour mirrors bruised covenant. Micro-setting—thumb against dent—literally steers attention and becomes the closing orienting device. One object and one landscape constrain every tactical move; no other setting could produce the geomagnetic “translation.” Exquisite economy: each detail serves either sensory bodying or stakes, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve chess as pure intellect—survives intact; pressure tightens when geomagnetic pulses translate into recollections of royal coercion. Single meaningful escalation: eastward spike → stillness void → renunciation reframed as fidelity. Cost is opportunity loss (court, library) legible in final image. No causal reversal required under accumulative design; one decisive intensification suffices. Could edge higher if the prince’s political threat carried a sharper contemporary consequence on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—“beauty blooms in difficulty”—emerges through pattern of fracture revealing light: broken covenant → exile → nexus clarification; dented stone → resilience signature. No moralising; final star-configured chessboard image reweights prior metaphors without statement. Subtext of silence as fertile rather than weaponised threads cleanly through beats. A fractional deduction for near-literal echo of theme in “beauty in the difficult turn” line keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through tactile geometry (“six moves ahead,” “chess pieces—Knight’s Leap”). Syntax mirrors contemplative pressure—long cadences for wind, clipped fragments for magnetic spikes—without losing clarity. Free indirect thought (“demanding the ‘Scorpion’s Gambit’”) stays in lexicon of tutor. No head-hopping, no register drift; rhythmic control heightens final benediction whisper. Precision warrants 9-band.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, thematic, or causal work. Figurative language is selective (“sky bleeding twilight hues”) and internally coherent; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs avoided; strong verbs (“pierced,” “rooted”) drive motion. One minor template run—“His…His…He…” in closing paragraph—detected but does not touch closure beat. Density, clarity, and rhythm hold under peak pressure; qualifies for high band.</comment>

<comment>Fusing geomagnetic nexus with chess metaphysics feels inevitable yet fresh; no familiar trope map covers this terrain. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—stone dent and magnetic pulse are irreplaceable. Stakes hinge on intellectual purity而非 revenge arc, sidestepping exile clichés. Final celestial chessboard reconfigures prior motifs rather than borrowing set-piece imagery. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; earns bonus inflection.</comment>
