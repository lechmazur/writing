<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor guilt and “alchemy” motive are vivid; the bolt-as-key micro-choice crystallizes her turn. Interiority stays concrete (“honest edges” vs “smooth lies”). No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible not tested; her virtuously mischievous trait is shown once then shelved. Closure choice is earned, but emotional contradiction could be sharper under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc: bolt → Heartroot → diamond lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (loss of the tactile anchor). Causal chain holds: volunteer act triggers Convergence, message cue focuses intent, bolt sacrifice seeds future hope. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: glitch texts’ origin never clarified, but pattern taught early enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fungal cavern is filtered through Elara’s healing gaze—cerulean glow mirrors her emotional shift. Bolt recurs as micro-setting that constrains the final act; its cold ridge reappears at pressure peak. Sensory economy favors damp soil scent and nebula-pulsing root over visual catalog. Spatial choreography clean: kneel, press, release, bury—each move tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate pressure into meaning”—is signaled early and tightened when she alone steps into the Heartroot chamber. Agency drives escalation: volunteer → press bolt → lose anchor; cost is the very object she clung to. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: pressure → diamond, shadow → light, scam → gift. Final burial enacts “wonder woven from hardship” without sermon. Subtext resides in silent spore constellations and the hidden diamond—hope planted off-stage. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in who will find the seed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile steel vs fungal softness. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for cavern awe, clipped fragments during glitch surge. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control tight—“captured nebula” fits POV’s wonder. One scaffold risk: “pressure” noun repeats 5× in 60 words mid-scene, but rhythm justifies thematic insistence. Zero mixed metaphors; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quantum scam-survivor grief with fungal alchemy feels fresh; bolt-to-diamond transmutation reframes self-help cliché into speculative body. Risk taken: abstract “quantum promise” grounded in tactile sacrifice. Transformation test passes—swap bolt for coin and metaphor collapses. No derivative echo detected.</comment>
