<comment>Elara’s interiority is granular and embodied—her scarred hands, the ribbon’s texture against her palm, the way dusk “bled indigo”—and her micro-choice to retrace the family poem ritual directly seeds the memorial design. The contradiction between stone’s permanence and grief’s fluidity is held in her body throughout. Lyra functions as externalized conscience, not a second character, so relationship crucible doesn’t apply. Final renunciation of a monolithic monument is earned and costly: she forsakes the safety of a single “answer” for a living path.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the circular ribbon-path memorial crystallizes as both physical blueprint and spiritual migration, with undeniable conceptual cost—she must surrender control of fixed form. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated image clusters (monarchs, ribbon, poems) tighten density until the pattern reweights grief itself. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”). No causality breaks; every reflective block is tethered to present sensory cue and alters her next micro-choice. Final image of “living constellation” is Charged Poise: options reconfigured, cost felt.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse glass, dormant jasmine, moss-stained bench, and migrating monarchs are filtered through Elara’s carver-eye: she notices texture, weight, permanence versus ephemerality. The woven ribbon roll functions as micro-setting: handled in at least three beats—clutched, unspooled, re-rolled—its threads literally guide the memorial’s resin channels. Butterfly timeframe supplies living clock that pressures her choice before nightfall. Spatial choreography is clean: she never leaves the bench until the final rise, ribbon still in hand. Setting constrains the final image—circular path must be walkable, sandstone tangible, resin catching light like wings.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is legible early: find a shape for 37-fold communal grief before personal paralysis hardens. Escalation is Accumulative—each recalled poem and ribbon-tie adds density until the swarm of monarchs forces the pattern break; options narrow to living migration or static monolith. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of a single authoritative stone, embracing endless footfalls and weathering. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Textural lens. One meaningful tightening—realizing grief must migrate—reweights all prior ribbon/poem images.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: collective grief is not monument but motion, a south-bound river of separate wings. Subtext lives in silence—Lyra’s moonlit gesture, the unspoken knot her grandmother tied, the “thundering calm” after Auden’s clocks stop. Final image reprises monarch constellation as non-literal answer: no moral, only renewed pattern. No thematic echo of prompt language; “shape of collective grief” is dramatized, never labeled. Complexity honored: individual sorrow remains solitary yet inseparable from the flock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter—granite dust, candle-lit Rumi, monarch wingbeats—without head-hop. Distinct carver idiom: “solemn permanence,” “stone and grief,” “listen to the silence between words.” No dialogue, so naturalism test waived. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: final paragraph collapses into heartbeat rhythm—“She rose… heart steady… stepping into the cool evening.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay within her vocational lexicon. Patterned repetition (“migration,” “ribbon,” “path”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional arc—long, image-laden clauses in reflection shorten to staccato beats at discovery. Figurative language is disciplined: “dusk bled indigo,” “river of orange and black,” each vehicle sustained without muddle. Information density high: single sentence (“Clutched in her lap…”) delivers object history, color palette, and emotional freight. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases image that recharges every prior ribbon/poem/butterfly cluster. Zero typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses stone-carver craft with butterfly migration as fresh metaphor for communal grief—risky synthesis that could feel contrived yet lands inevitable. Ritual of tying poems with heirloom ribbon is particular to this family; swapping any element would collapse memorial concept. Spectral mentor avoids cliché by functioning as internalized tradition rather than expositional device. Final reconfiguration—walkable poem path—transforms both cemetery trope and memorial expectation. Emotional specificity trumps surface novelty; risk-taking sharpens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
