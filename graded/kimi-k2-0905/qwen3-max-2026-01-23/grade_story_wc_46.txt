<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is tactile and specific (the knee ache, the glass warming in her palm), but the only micro-choice on stage is “continue polishing.” The stakes never test an alternative path, so her contradictory impulses stay latent. No cost is visibly foregone; the closure is pure gift. Still, the embodied memories and occupational detail keep her above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, orientation locked within 120 words, closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl’s “reflectively vibrant potential” reweights the premise that light must burn. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. One tighten only—mass lost on the scale—yet the cost is conceptual, not felt. Meets 9- gate for closure form; lens coherence intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist, drip, jasmine scent, brass scale—every sensory note is filtered through Elara’s earth-bound care. The grotto’s wet stone literally steadies her bad knee and determines the slow tempo of work. Sea glass evolves from trash to “pocket-sized sanctuary,” constraining the final choice to gift rather than keep. Micro-setting (shard in palm) charges the last image; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—craft safe light for fevered child—signaled early, but pressure is ambient, not tightening. No active opposition or trade-off; the only obstacle is the glass’s own opacity, which yields steadily. Escalation is a gentle density increase under Accumulative lens; no option is foreclosed. Satisfies single-deepening rule for lyric short-form but misses visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—not declared—through the iterative revealing of latent light: “we do not create beauty; we reveal the light already sleeping within the broken.” The pearl’s final glow answers Liam’s whispered question without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: will reflected light truly quiet his nightmares? The jasmine zephyr reprises renewal without closing the loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect diction stays inside an aging, sea-minded watcher: “slow, patient heartbeat” of drips, “cloudy veil” surrendering to aqueous radiance. Rhythm lengthens and contracts with polishing strokes; no filter-verb clutter. Grandmother’s remembered line carries distinct idiom; Elara’s paraphrase of it keeps cadence consistent. Voice never leaks into editorial gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High figurative density but patterned—glass-as-teardrop, mist-as-blessing, stars-as-calm—taught early and reprised at closure, so allowed. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances mood or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“light that required no fire” / “light could be offered without consumption”) costs –0.2. Otherwise momentum breathes with the task.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transforming beach trash into a night-light for a traumatized child is fresh, but the grandmother aphorism and “stars without burning” echo familiar workshop sentiment. Specificity of gem-polishing ritual and mist-wreathed grotto keep it from template territory. No late rule changes; concept commits fully. Risk is moderate, not boundary-pushing.</comment>
