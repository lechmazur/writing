<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his tracing of the waxed leaf, the memory of Elara’s scent, the ache in his ribs as he packs—yet the “intuitively descriptive” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we are told he reads rust patterns rather than shown a beat where that skill alters a choice. The vow-of-retirement stone is a strong motive, but the pivot to chasing the living is powered almost entirely by the cylinder letter rather than an active internal contradiction on the page. Still, the final step onto the cracked earth is a credible renunciation with felt cost, lifting the score into high-band territory.</comment>

<comment>Closure is immaculate under the Accumulative/Textural lens: the waxed leaf re-illuminated through lantern light is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior solitude into anticipation; the cost—abandoning the safety of Rusthaven, reopening wound-memories—is legible in the single sentence “He did not look back.” Causality is tight: “truth is often tinted” cues the tinted-filter method early; the cylinder riddle sets up the final optical reveal; no step feels arbitrary. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Rusthaven, the scrapyard settlement…”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. A hairline slip: the micro-glyphs are described before we see Kael discover them, a minor sequence fuzz that keeps it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The scrapyard is sketched with scavenged-wood bench, wind-sighing rebar, ochre sky—selective, tactile, lived-in. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the waxed leaf functions as portable environment, its veins constraining the only method that can reveal the hidden text, thus directly charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: cylinder and leaf are placed side-by-side, picked up, angled, pocketed—no floating props. One missed chance for non-visual sensory under pressure: the lantern beam could have scorched the leaf’s brittle edge, adding stakes, but the description never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: the cylinder offers a literal bridge to Elara, turning memory into a directional path. The deepening is driven by Kael’s agency: he rejects Elder Anya, tries and fails with every tool, then risks grief by holding the leaf-filter to the light—an irrevocable narrowing from stasis to pursuit. Cost is visible—retirement vow broken, safety forfeited—but not as viscerally felt as the thematic ache; a sharper physical price (bleeding knuckle on jagged metal, thirst acknowledged in tomorrow’s desert) would have secured the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: love as literal lens, memory as technology, wilderness as quiet that can be tuned to reunion. The autumn leaf reprises as both keepsake and optical filter—its earlier function (nostalgia) repriced into navigational instrument, a Conceptual Repricing that lands in the final image. No tidy moral; the ending invites both hope and the possibility that Elara is already dead, leaving ambiguity that lingers. The wild hush evolves from desolation to anticipatory breath—an atmospheric answer to the thematic question of how to hear the absent beloved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature is strong—rust patterns as “histories,” silence as “weight in a shadow’s shape.” Syntax lengthens in memory, shortens under pressure (“He packed. He walked.”), mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue to distort voice. One filter-verb cluster (“He tried water, smoke, angled light…”) is acceptable mid-attempt, not in peak beat. Diction never exceeds a scavenger’s lexicon; elevated phrases (“symphony of absence”) feel earned as poetic compression rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—each sentence advances stake or texture. Metaphors are spare and precise: “the vow of retirement a heavy stone,” “wind carried no dust today, only the faint, sweet ghost of autumn.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line crystallizes direction without exposition. Minor hyphenated coinage (“wild-hush”) is consistent and pattern-taught. Proofreading flawless; no typos or tense wobble.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic reunion quest is familiar, yet the optical riddle that requires a loved object as filter feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The phonograph cylinder repurposed as data dead-drop, the leaf as Rosetta stone—both are specific, non-swappable inventions. Risk is taken: quiet lyric pacing in a wasteland usually demands gunfire; here the tension is held by light and shadow, and it pays off. Slight deduction for the “one last maple” echoing every post-war pastoral cliché, but the execution rescues it.</comment>
