<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“hot, corrosive jealousy”) and drives the dream confrontation; the jealousy → wonder shift is embodied in the wave from the younger self. The grave-shock incites the scroll act, but the causal bridge between cemetery jolt and cabin compulsion is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping motivation just short of airtight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each past-self shard layers tonal density until the birch line delivers the reweighting (“The grave is not the story”). Orientation is swift; the dream-awake transition is clean and lands a Charged Poise with conceptual cost. One minor lapse: the scroll’s spontaneous inscription skirts physical causality, though the lyric pattern teaches us to accept it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silver-birch scroll and pine-table grooves supply micro-setting that constrains the final inscription. Selective sensory detail (cold seeping through chinks, pines’ whisper) stays inside POV bias. Exterior mountain vista is rendered in broad strokes; no concrete environmental obstacle alters tactics, so the peak gate for 9+ is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stake—render mortality legible through narrative—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral self tightens the emotional vise until the younger Elias’s wave collapses jealousy into wonder, foreclosing despair without resetting mortality. Cost is felt via the tear-tracked release, though no durable external constraint is imposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive image chain of carving/graving vs. flight; the final line reweights “grave” from terminus to launching ridge. No moral is declared; resonance is earned through concrete particulars. Ambiguity remains—time is still tangled—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: tactile table grooves, animalistic nostalgia, “discarded quiver” metaphor. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative clauses build dream density, then short declaratives land the tear. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within a ranger-poet lexicon. No head-hop; POV distance is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences twin image with insight without paraphrase loops. One mixed metaphor cluster (“minutes bled into decades” beside “memory felt as immediate as cold”) slightly blurs temporal logic. No scaffold, no template cadence; closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Takes the familiar “confront your younger self” trope but reframes it as lucid cartography of mortality, not regret tourism. Birch-scroll auto-writing risks deus ex machina yet is saved by lyric pattern taught early. Specific mountain ranger life details keep the vision anchored; still, the core trope visibility caps originality just below the top band.</comment>
