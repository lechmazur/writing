<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory guilt / duty currents braid viscerally: her crushed hand flares with every polished floor, grounding cowardice in nerve-fire. The bench-bolt memory crystallizes Kael’s caretaker ethos and her complicity, earning her vow to open the stair-memorial. Interiority stays concrete; no abstract self-diagnosis. Final renunciation (“the bolt on the concierge desk”) bears visible cost and is fully motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished reflection thickens guilt until the periwinkle teardrop forces pattern break. Hidden-piano reveal lands Earned Stasis—she forecloses secrecy by propping the wall open, bolt displayed. Cost is unmistakable: fortress acoustic purity cracked, her anonymity gone. Orientation anchored by line ~70; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cobalt walls, concave centuries-old steps, and nerve-fire limb form micro-setting triad that actively constrain silence and movement. Bolt’s rust pits supply tactile link to Kael’s caretaker ethic; bench lid lift recharges it. Frosted-window piano chamber mirrors her internal “frozen hope,” charging final image. Environment shapes every tactical choice without decorative sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guilt versus acoustic obedience—tightens when discoloration offers actionable rebellion; silence option narrows to zero once she presses the stone. Bolt discovery reweights safety myth with irreversible cost, forcing open-door stance. Agency drives each escalatory beat; coincidence absent. Pressure intensifies once, sufficient for 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—“safety bought with silence accrues unpayable debt”—emerges through mirrored floors and mute protocols, never stated. Subtext of caretaker love lives in bolt texture; fortress acoustics equal institutional repression. Final glass-case gesture reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Complexity preserved: obedience still keeps her employed, guilt still aches.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; vocabulary (“seraphically mundane,” “nerve-fire”) belongs to Elara’s perception. Syntax lengthens under grief then fractures during stone press, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; Kael’s voice surfaces as authenticated memory. Compression in lines like “frostbitten hope…stubborn as granite” teaches pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion: noun-verb pairs (“bolt’s the anchor,” “wall slid inward”) avoid modifiers. Metaphor disciplined—“shard of frozen sky” introduces palette and recurs. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected. One clause of simultaneous action (“tears traced…freezing instantly”) is allowable under sub-zero logic; does not cloud causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mundane hotel upkeep + glacial acoustic cult + caretaker bolt yields unfamiliar emotional engine. Periwinkle discoloration as archival trigger reverses typical secret-lever trope by rewarding guilt-sharpened sight. Bolt’s bench-integrity metaphor reweights safety ethic; not transferable to generic item. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off in resonant Charged Poise.</comment>
