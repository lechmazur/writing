<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation and solitude are vividly embodied; the palm-to-stone moment lets contradictory impulses (wonder vs duty) coexist in scene. The final choice to entrust the floating fossil to the tide-crack is earned: she relinquishes sole custody, accepting future interpreters. Interiority stays concrete, though “hope bloomed” edges label-speak. Cost is legible: she walks away lighter yet more alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens until the fossil’s levitation breaks pattern, reweighting the map’s purpose. Orientation is swift (bare feet, damp contours by line 3). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering leaf in the crevice crystallizes her new stance—archive becomes offering. Persistent constraint: the fossil’s own “pulse” now dictates where future seekers must look.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cave damp, kelp-paper, whalebone brush—every tool is handled and constrains method. The coastal network’s geography is tracked without drift; the workshop’s star-dusted aperture mirrors the amber core she paints. Micro-setting triumph: the tide-worn crevice she chooses as final repository is tactile and specific, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the world’s memory survive forgetting—tightens when the fossil’s levitation demands a new custodial plan. One meaningful deepening: the map shifts from private record to public beacon; options narrow to “hide it where others will feel it.” Cost is visible: she gives up possession for possible recognition. No reversal, but pressure coheres under accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-fragrance-of-feeling emerges from pigment, algae, fossil, not exposition. The fossil’s surrender becomes a non-literal answer: grace is archived by letting go. Subtext in the final placement—covenant left to salt and strangers—avoids moralizing. Ambiguity remains: seekers may still mis-read, but the risk is priced in.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature: temperature as emotion, pigments as language. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for descent, clipped phrases for levitation. No dialogue, so no contamination. Diction stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon; “treated kelp-paper” feels lived, not glossed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are sparse and coherent (amber core = heartbeat). Sentence variety supports tide-like rise and fall. One near-purple phrase—“radiant amber core”—survives because it names the map’s literal pigment frequency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Heat-mapping grief into cartography feels fresh, and the fossil’s measurable serenity flips typical techno-magic. Risk: letting an inert leaf float could read gimmicky, yet the piece earns it by anchoring emotion in limestone and pigment. Synthesis of climate-rest narrative with personal archive is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
