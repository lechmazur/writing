<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“salvation slept in the geometry of forgotten things” feels hers—but she never makes a scene-level micro-choice; the solstice success is off-stage, so the cost and change are only reported. The “lyrically prophetic” trait stays ornamental; no contradictory impulse complicates her broadcast. We’re told her isolation ends, yet she takes no on-page action to earn that shift. Voice is distinct, but motivation never sharpens into a stakes-bearing decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the laughter recording reweights her life’s work from futile to fruitful. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early—lightning-lit shards—and holds an Accumulative lens: each static fragment accrues until the unbroken 23-second burst. Causality, however, is thin; the orchard vault opens by precise cosmic timing, not by any choice that risks or costs her anything on the page. Orientation is secure by 120 words, but the protagonist’s agency is absent at the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt portico and stormlit aerie are rendered with tactile specificity—“thrumming with captured lightning”—and the shifting shadows literally guide the final map. Sensory hierarchy stays anchored to Elara’s gaze; every visual detail is also a tool that transforms chaos into meaning. Environment never constrains her physically—she never moves or manipulates the portico under pressure—but the image recharges in the last line, casting the hopeful shadow that reweights the theme. One notch off exemplary because the setting never actively limits her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is signaled early, yet pressure escalates only by accretion of listeners, not by any narrowing of Elara’s own options. She broadcasts; the world reacts off-stage. No reversal or trade-off is demanded of her; the ionosphere clearing is sheer gift. Cost is felt by distant villagers, not by the protagonist, so agency and escalation register as atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as collaborative tapestry versus top-down certainty. Subtext lives in the static gaps—“locked garden” left for villagers to complete. The final children’s laughter is an earned non-literal answer. Only minor abstraction—“fractured world mended by overlooked shadows”—leans toward thesis, but it is seeded early enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays tightly filtered through Elara’s storm-heightened perception; syntax stretches into prophetic cadence without losing clarity. Patterned repetition (“shadow” iterations) is taught early and pays off in the last line’s hopeful projection. No head-hopping; multi-shard jumps are clearly sectioned. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” diction feels academic for the POV, but it occurs outside the focal burst.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured and varied—“raw energy of the tempest and the ghosts of forgotten star charts” does dual world/character work. Occasional modifier stacks—“rain-slicked Oakhaven,” “cobalt glass portico”—slow the beat but never within the 23-second climax. No loops or scaffold; opening and closing images ring without echoing verbatim. Strong read-aloud rhythm; only a faint purple tinge keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “prophet vs. heretic” scaffold but flips victory to asynchronous collaboration through radio riddles and seed-vault horticulture—specific, grounded, and non-obvious. Shadow-as-archive motif accrues rather than decorates. Risky mosaic structure is taught early and holds. Not quite singular enough for the 9+ band—echoes of Le Guin’s solitary messengers—but the synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
