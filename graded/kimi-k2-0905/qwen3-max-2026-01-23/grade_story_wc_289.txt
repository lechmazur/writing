<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her quiet collecting and final placement of “home” crystallize a believable arc from detached observer to participant. The contradiction between hoarding strangers’ secrets and craving her own connection stays implicit yet legible. No head-hopping or label-speak; micro-choices (gathering, weaving, writing) track her hierarchy of values. Voice remains coherent, but the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cranked—her loneliness dissolves almost too smoothly, restraining the score from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm → spiral discovery → installation → visitors → her own secret, each beat causally triggered. Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral stands, now breathing with communal offerings, and her word “home” lands as visible cost—she forfeits anonymity. Orientation anchored within 60 words; single transition (dusk-to-dawn) is legible. No plot amnesia or convenience; the twig re-appears at center as earned fulcrum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lotus temple and pond are filtered through Elara’s collector-gaze; every prop she gathers is handled tactilely, grounding the scene. Weather’s aftermath (wet stone, drifting petals) directly enables her material choices and constrains timing. Spatial choreography is clean: perimeter path → water’s edge → kneeling → box placement. Final moonlit image reuses the prismatic quiet, recharging the opening sensory palette with new communal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her need to locate “the thread”—is signaled early and tightened when she decides to externalize it into a public weave. The act of rejoin narrows her solitude: each visitor offering forecloses her exclusive keeper role and risks exposure. Cost is visible: she sacrifices secrecy, signs the installation with her own word. One meaningful escalation suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal rejoin emerges through iterative image of spiral-as-web, never sermonized. The thrush’s instinctive architecture reframed as human ritual reweights nature into culture without commentary. Final image of every secret becoming a stitch offers resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. Ambiguity remains—no moral pronouncement—inviting reader to sense, not decode, meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual quirks: she notices textures, weights, folds—fitting a ghostwriter who traffics in intimate surfaces. Syntax lengthens during gathering, then shortens at the final “home,” mirroring her inward spiral. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional lyric elevation (“prismatic quiet”) is taught in paragraph 1 and remains consistent; cadence variation keeps musicality from monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + sensory tag—without scaffolding; no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors are few, apt, internally coherent (“tiny architecture of instinct”). Paragraph breaks follow beats: find → build → invite → witness → complete. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and closing “prismatic quiet” functions as deliberate reprise, not redundancy. Clean grammar, precise tense, no artifacts even at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines secret-keeper trope with public-art method in a way that feels organic to Elara’s occupation and setting. Spiral motif recurs but originates from found bird-nest twist, avoiding generic symbol graft. Risk taken: climax is communal stasis rather than private epiphany, yet coherence holds. Could edge higher with sharper friction during the transition from solitude to kinship.</comment>
