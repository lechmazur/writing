<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is legible and tied to the texture-of-time premise, but the interiority leans on abstraction (“deep calm,” “grateful smile”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—the rediscovery and final act feel pre-ordained. As a result, the earned-cost bar for 8+ is not cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael dissolves after embedding the fragment-message, reweighting time-as-texture for Elara and reader. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image adds density until the capsule’s purpose flips. Cost is felt in Kael’s dissolution, but the beat is compressed into one sentence; a hairline slip keeps it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Emerald silo” and “oak table” give quick anchors; the urn fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory triad (coarse weave, silken slide, gritty dust) is selective and POV-filtered. Environment does not constrain tactics—no door locked, no spatial hazard—so the 9+ gate is missed by a whisker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit tactile time before borrowed hours expire—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Kael presses the glyph and feels his remaining texture, but escalation is mostly imagistic rather than a narrowing of options; Elara’s arrival is external coincidence. Sufficient for the length, yet the reversible shift from “timeless sea” to garage-sale card lacks a visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: time as shared sensory language rather than metric. The urn’s reprise reweights grief into continuity, achieving resonance. One abstraction breath—“time passes not in ticks, but in textures”—edges toward statement; kept just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (“grain of time,” “velvet of peace”). Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentence for the timeless sea, then short clauses for the card. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction remains within lexicon. Minor filter verb cluster (“he began to rediscover”) holds it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is clean: strong verbs, no template cadence, figurative language kept purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“breathing tapestry” alongside “pollen on the wind”) momentarily blurs the vehicle. High information density; only micro-slip prevents 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-metric time rendered as haptic garage-sale evangelism is fresh; Thorne’s urn-heartbeat seed adds conceptual twist. Tropes (borrowed time, dissolving mentor) are re-textured rather than subverted. Synthesis feels particular, inevitable in hindsight, meriting low-8 band.</comment>
