<comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is rendered through tactile, embodied action—kneeling, brushing ash, trembling as she lifts the negative—so her interiority stays concrete. The contradictory pull between despair (burned diaries) and hope (hidden film) is dramatized in-scene, not summarized, giving her final covenant felt cost. The only drag is a touch of lyrical self-diagnosis—“legacy’s burden now a companion”—that momentarily lifts us into abstract label-speak instead of letting the weight stay physical.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed cloth-lined case and whispered promise reconfigure her prior curiosity into lifelong guardianship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each artifact layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is secured by word 50 (“ivy-veiled passage”), well inside the 120-word allowance, and the soft-stone/ivy rules remain consistent. One hairline slip: “walls dreamed in symphonies” edges toward mixed metaphor, but it does not touch the final beat.</comment>

<comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting: its damp flagstones force Elara to kneel, the thinned ivy patch grants the only sunlit stage for the negative reveal, and the rustling leaves become the audible acceptance of her covenant. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes mortar vibrations before wider geography—keeping description character-filtered. The black hearth mouth and fused pages supply tactile specificity that anchors the discovery beat. Environment does not merely decorate; it literally guides her body to the diaries and later certifies her promise with leaf-motion, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will she shoulder the walls’ dreams—tightens once: from detached observation to irrevocable covenant when she seals the fragments. Agency is continuous: every beat is her active unearthing, deciphering, holding the negative to light, deciding to carry. Cost is visible on-page in the final third—“heart heavier yet clearer,” “whispered to the stones”—foreclosing the path of casual curiosity. Under Accumulative lens the pressure escalates by density of found artifacts rather than external opposition, a legitimate short-form intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of remembering both joy and grief is argued through the concrete counterpoint of burned despair versus preserved sunlight on film, never sermonized. The final image—“walls still dreamed of sunlight, and she was their faithful witness”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question “what walls dream about.” No late abstraction hijacks the closing beat; meaning stays lodged in the sealed case and rustling ivy. The piece invites counter-reading: perhaps the dream is delusional consolation, but that ambiguity is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: syntax stretches slightly for rhythm (“quiet reverence of a corridor echo cartographer”) yet remains readable. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Register holds consistent archaeological lyric without drifting into academic or corporate diction. The only micro-slip is “legacy’s burden” used twice as noun-label, a tiny echo of template cadence, but the voice quickly re-embodies in tactile motion.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, mixed metaphors rare. Information density high—single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional charge (“Tears welled; this was the walls’ dream—a memory of warmth preserved against encroaching silence”). Rhythm modulates naturally from short clauses under pressure to longer lyrical cadences at rest. A single line—“each breath a commitment to memory”—skirts poetic template, but its placement mid-paragraph rather than at closure keeps it from artifact status.</answer>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The climate-softened stone/ivy premise is fresh, turning familiar post-apocalyptic ruins into a sensate archive that breathes. The conceit that walls dream, and that a cartographer maps those dreams, is specific enough to resist swap-test with another story. Risk is taken and paid off: the negative strip literalizes color inside a gray-green world without becoming a gimmick, recharging the entire color palette at climax. The synthesis of eco-gothic texture with archival tenderness feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
