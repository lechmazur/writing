<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—duty vs. dream-excavation—stays present in each micro-choice (prying stone, uncorking inkwell), but the interiority leans on lyrical summary (“hushed blaze”) rather than moment-to-moment embodiment under rising time pressure. Still, the final renunciation (leaving before the lake returns) costs him the pavilion’s visibility, so the arc earns its stoic endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he caps the inkwell, forecloses further inscription, and accepts the lake’s reclamation—cost is the unseen future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each note layers absence into witness until the cadence shift (“You are remembered”) reweights the stone library. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The antique inkwell functions as micro-setting: brass temperature against ribs, scent of iron-gall, final click—each constrains timing and charges the exit image. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s surveyor gaze (mud, lime, wisteria ghost), anchoring the submerged pavilion without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue dreams from obliteration—tightens once: drawbridge clang narrows the window, forcing the last note and exit. The escalation is Accumulative: each inserted note increases stakes for the next; no external antagonist needed. Cost is the unseen archive, felt but not visibly priced on-page, keeping it just below the 8.2 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: interlaced absence → interlaced inscription. The final note reconfigures absence as vessel, offering Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Particulars (tooth-for-kite, wisteria whisper) resist generic “memory” abstraction; aftereffect lingers as submerged witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustained: syntactic parallelism (“interlaced absence,” “hushed blaze”) taught early and paid off in final cadence. Perceptual signature—surveyor’s metric attention to erosion, mortar, constellation etch—remains character-specific. No head-hop; psychic distance pulls back only for the reflective last paragraph, justified as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful anaphora; no scaffold loops or filter stacks. Metaphors stay coherent (lake as glass, ink as seed). One paraphrase loop (“interlaced absence was no longer a wound; it was a tapestry”) costs −0.2. Otherwise information-dense, propulsive, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Concept of “archivist of submerged dreams” feels fresh; combines shore-survey expertise with covert epigraphy. Inkwell-as-covenant and note-in-mortar method are specific, not generic memory tropes. Transformation test fails if Elias were simply a poet, so originality holds. Risk in lyric repetition pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
