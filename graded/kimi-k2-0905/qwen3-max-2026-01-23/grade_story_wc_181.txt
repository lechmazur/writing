<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Curator Elara’s interior contradiction—sworn duty vs. hunger for forbidden knowledge—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hand, the whispered question, the silent intent are all embodied and specific. The final beat of “luminous understanding” is earned because her earlier failure at the viewport forces the tactical shift to receptive silence. Cost is legible: guild law breached, tears freeze on her cheeks, stewardship burden newly internalized. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV depth is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the once-blank ledger now bears the cameo’s carving, crystallizing her irreversible initiation into stewardship. Causal chain holds—failed extraction → bathroom epiphany → open offering → memory inscription → ledger change—each beat narrows options. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (tapestry metaphor) and holds to last line. Orientation clear by line 4; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silver-leaved, starlight-pulsing orchard is rendered through Elara’s curator gaze; sensory hierarchy favors sight and haptic cold, justified by her professional scrutiny. Setting constrains the final choice: only at the oldest tree, during blossoming zenith, can resonance occur; asteroid silence and low-gravity water droplets ground the ritual. Spatial choreography clean—viewport → sanitation module → regolith walk → tree heart—no floating rooms. Environment actively answers her whisper, making the orchard a participant, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking guild expulsion to unlock cameo—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when she steps outside, physically crossing the boundary of permitted action. One meaningful deepening: realization that she must give, not take, forecloses the earlier extraction tactic and exposes her to potential overdose of foreign memories. Cost visible: frozen tears, warm shell, glowing ledger—each image marks irreversible change. Coincidence absent; escalation is internal stance shift that reconfigures external outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship-as-inheritance emerges organically from the orchard’s memory-exchange physiology; no character sermonizes. The pistachio shell—humble, natural, once discarded—becomes sacred vessel, reweighting “forbidden” into “trust.” Final image of ledger carving offers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge is no longer contraband but covenant. Ambiguity lingers: will she teach or conceal this truth? No moral tagline imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filters—“trembling fingers,” “quiet fire,” “splash of water on her face.” Syntax lengthens during epiphany (“light streamed… into her soul”) then contracts to single-sentence paragraph for homecoming, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet skipped. Register consistent—curatorial precision blended with lyrical awe—no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence for memory cascade, staccato fragments for regolith crunch. Figurative language is selective—one sustained tapestry metaphor taught early and paid off; no mixed stacks. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, interiority, and motion. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; pronoun references clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Combines humble pistachio shell with cosmic memory orchard—fresh synthesis rather than checklist. “Simply complicated” paradox is dramatized, not asserted, through resonance mechanics. Bathroom epiphany risks cliché yet is justified by prior ritual mention and low-gravity water image. Specific detail (constellation-bark, frozen tears) prevents generic space-fantasy gloss.</comment>
