<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet, method-driven interiority is consistent and particular; his refusal to force a solution but instead “listen with his eyes” embodies a believable, profession-rooted stance. The micro-choice to craft the pin only after the reflection-revelation shows interior contradiction (precision vs. patience) under pressure. Cost is felt: he seals the vials with a chest-tight pulse, foreclosing the option to keep the season’s wonder raw. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; even the cellar metaphor stays embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s first tick harmonizes with the cavern’s heartbeat, crystallizing a new temporal order inside the marble. Causal chain holds—each reflection angle literally teaches the next diagnostic step, so the final insertion is inevitable yet surprising. Cost is legible in the final image: Kael walks into twilight carrying the “inner warmth” of stolen echoes, the season’s wound still open outside. The lens is Causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the misalignment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble walls act as both microscope and archive: their mirrored surfaces literally constrain how Kael can see and therefore act. The hairline fracture in the western wall and the vibrating water keep the cavern from feeling like a museum diorama; instead they supply diagnostic tools. Final image reuses the fractured reflections to refract Kael’s path—setting becomes epistemic engine, not backdrop. Only hairline slip: “dewdrop on the timer” feels serendipitous, not previously grounded in cavern micro-climate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—rescue the season’s silenced wonder by fixing the timer—tightens when each reflection reveals a deeper layer of breakage. Misalignment discovery is a genuine reversal: the problem was never broken gears but a ghost loop of correct function, forcing Kael to re-tool rather than replace. Cost is visible time-tax: dusk arrives, the cavern violet-gold, and Kael’s chest tightens as he seals the echoes—he pays with finite daylight and emotional room. No off-stage rescue; every escalation stems from his attentional labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: reason’s tools can cradle, not kill, wonder. The cellar metaphor re-prices at closure—what looked like cold storage becomes a warm, breathing archive. Subtext plays in the periphery motif: insight dwells “at the edges of sight,” honoring oblique attention over frontal assault. No moralizing final sentence; the twilight image lets the reader feel the conceptual reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual signature—every noticed detail is locksmith-relevant (fracture, angle, distortion). Syntax mirrors his filing precision: short sensory clauses, then a longer diagnostic sweep. No filter-verb clutter; “peripherally focused nature immediately registered” is the only latinate intrusion but is justified as trait announcement. Voice modulates under stress: dusk sentence lengthens, golden, almost tender, without breaking diction contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with diagnostic tempo: short beats for filing, longer lyrical rise at the harvest. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds either new mechanical knowledge or atmospheric charge. Metaphors are spare and mechanical—“ghost of correct function”—never stack into purple. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The acoustic harvest of a frost-crushed spring via mirrored marble is a fresh synthesis; locksmithing meets field recording in a cave. Periphery-as-method feels non-obvious yet inevitable once enacted. Risk lies in the lyric register, but it stays tied to concrete angles and pins, avoiding ornamental drift. Only echo of familiar trope is “wounded season,” but the cavern’s acoustic storage re-weights it.</comment>
