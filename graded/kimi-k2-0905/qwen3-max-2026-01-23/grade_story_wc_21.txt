<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s ink-stained hands, sleepless nights, and trembling will to rearrange basalt stones embody an archivist’s obsession; the retrocognitive trap forces a costly silent choice that forecloses passive observation. Interiority stays concrete—heart thrumming, weathered face streaked with tears—never slipping into label-speak. The contradiction between scholarly distance and bodily immersion is held in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation: he forfeits neutral archiving to intervene, paying with the agonising vision itself. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets correctly ignored; single-POV voice remains coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because Elias decrypts the diary, he is thrust into the retrocognitive trap; therefore he rearranges the stones, altering Anya’s escape and rewriting the historical record. Closure delivers visible cost—tears, gasping return, the diary now “deeper resonance”—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses the old official lie. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no ambiguity at closure. Persistent constraint: the diary-cipher and the trap’s rules shape every tactical push he attempts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating zeppelin library, violet twilight, and oak-panelled reading room anchor the present frame; the obsidian lagoon reprises as micro-setting that literally swallows starlight and later charges the final image. Selective sensory compression—gritty chill salt smell vs. hush of engines—mirrors temporal switch without checklist excess. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from desk to dunes and back; no impossible positions. The lagoon’s return in the last paragraph reweights the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the suppressed truth of Anya’s escape—tightens when Elias realises the patrol-direction error and must intervene without voice or touch. One meaningful escalation: the distant crunch of boots raises physical jeopardy, forcing the phantom stone-push that narrows options to “act silently or let her die.” Cost is legible: searing bodily immersion leaves him gasping and weeping, a price that alters his archival stance. Agency remains causal under the chosen lens; no coincidences resolve the threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history is not neutral archive but active, painful construction—truth literally rearranged by sweaty, ink-stained hands. Subtext resides in debris language and silent nods across time, never stated. Final image of dawn-lit writing reconfigures meaning: the lagoon’s black mirror becomes a source of future light. No sermonising; complexity preserved—official lie remains politically useful, yet personal redemption is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “ink stains of forgotten truths,” “gas-filled envelope a silent moon,” “polished wood vanished” deliver archivist-curator diction with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly chained to Elias. Free indirect slides cleanly into retrocognitive mode without filter-verb clutter. Compression under pressure—“He could not speak, could not touch”—mirrors the trap’s claustrophobia. Final line cadence slows to match dawn release, rewarding taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences twin celestial library with civil-rights archive, or merge cipher, heart-thrum, and historical stakes. Metaphors (“pool of liquid night”) remain internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Minor cadence repetition (“He could not… he could…”) is voice-motivated, pattern-paid by climax. Copy-clean; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<comment>Fusing Civil-Rights archive with retrocognitive zeppelin heist feels fresh; the encrypted diary as time-key and beach-debris as resistance code transform familiar protest tropes. Specificity anchors novelty—“abalone shells, basalt stones”—rather than abstract moon-talk. Risky second-person intrusion into past is earned by archival obsession established in line 1. Transformation test fails if elements swapped: only an archivist would cipher-read debris under liquid night. Conceptual integrity holds; no late-rule cheat.</comment>
