<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into patience—drives every beat; the final palm-press is earned by seven winters of recorded vigilance. Embodied emotion (“trembling only with reverence”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent. Cost is legible: her former urgency dissolves into “abiding patience as solid as the sanctuary stones,” a permanent stance shift. Missing 9+ only because no second character pressures her to test status or force visible mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald moss fissure reweights the premise—revolution begins not with fire but with quiet photosynthetic defiance. Causal chain holds: rain → recharged viaduct → refracted sigil → surrender → crack → moss. Accumulative lens is taught early by iterated moon tracking and pays off in the final image. Felt cost is undeniable: the lake’s “seal gently released” after decades of solitary vigil forecloses haste forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt columns, frost-rimed stone, and the ice-altar constrain footfall, instrument placement, and the exact angle of moon-beam refraction; environment literally scripts the climax. Selective sensory triage—numb gloved fingers, pluming breath—mirrors narrowed vigilance. Micro-setting (star chart grooves, basalt instruments) functions as tool-as-setting that must be handled just so. Final moss tendril steams against monochrome ice, recharging every prior obsidian image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free her people from “tyranny of haste”—tightens through one decisive intensification: the sigil demands surrender, not force. Escalation is accumulative: each moon path logged adds density until the single alignment forecloses impatience itself. Protagonist agency drives the turn—she chooses softness against every instinct. Price is the irreversible surrender of her former urgency, felt in the dissolving coil inside her chest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: patience as insurgent power, revolution measured in lichen minutes. Subtext lives in gesture—soft palm-press against hard ice enacts the thesis. Final image reweights “patient revolution” from abstract slogan to living green breaking stone. No moralizing; the moss simply exists, forcing reader to reconcile slowness with vitality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—“breath pluming,” “numb despite woolen gloves.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with lunar rhythm, prose breathing under pressure. No head-hop; celestial mechanics rendered through her chart-born idiom. Distinct texture—“unyoke,” “obsidian mirror,” “star-dusted sky”—without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: movement, atmosphere, and lunar math. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds new angle or tension. Figurative language peaks at the moss emergence, justified by prior monochrome setup. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward sigil pulse, then exhales with the single crack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of geomantic moon-mapping with slow-politics revolution feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Magnetic viaduct re-purposed as cosmic prism repurposes mundane infrastructure into ritual tech. Emerald moss as first insurrectionist seed flips usual fire-brand revolt. Conceptual risk succeeds: slowness becomes thrilling without paradoxical sermon.</comment>
