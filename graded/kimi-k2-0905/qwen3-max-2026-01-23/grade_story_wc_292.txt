<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingertip tracing the stanza, the cold copper nail in her palm—but the “nervously confident” label is announced, not embodied. The micro-choice to press the nail into the page is concrete and stakes-shifting, showing her ancestor’s exile reversal as lived cost. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure; she moves from dread to certainty without visible internal friction. The final hand that “no longer trembles” is earned, but the emotional arc is tidier than human.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore links—patina matches ink → coordinates found → tsunami predicted → evacuation ordered. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with felt cost: the station she hated becomes the sacrifice that redeems both Aris and herself. The copper nail’s shift from relic to key is repriced on the page. One micro-turn (indentations revealed) tightens the chain; no coincidence resolves the plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The low bruised sky and “spongey dread” seep through wool and metal, anchoring atmosphere inside Elara’s body. The station’s archive and viewport function as micro-settings that gate discovery; the reef beneath becomes an active antagonist once its coordinates surface. Weather jargon is selective—“barometric pressure plummeting”—and motivates the final scramble. Spatial choreography holds as personnel climb the emergency ladder while the black wall erases the structure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing Aris’s exile—converges with physical survival once the coded stanza maps onto the incoming tsunami. Pressure tightens exactly once: the discovery that the station sits atop the reef turns intellectual victory into mortal threat. Agency is intellectual rather than physical; the decisive act is to lay journal and nail on the console, forcing the technician’s belief. Cost is visible—the station is swallowed—yet the price is borne by infrastructure, not Elara’s body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of exile: bureaucratic haste once damned Aris; Elara’s methodical haste now saves lives. The copper nail’s redefinition—from death token to proof of courage—carries the conceptual reweighting without overt statement. “The deep remembers its anger” risks thematic echo, but stays within Elara’s idiom and links geologic to ancestral memory. Final image of the hand steadying around the nail offers quiet resonance rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptions; diction—“nervously confident,” “spongey dread”—is hers, not authorial. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into urgent imperatives during evacuation, mirroring barometric drop. No filter-verb clutter; perceptions arrive as sensory facts—“salt-stained lamp,” “verdigris patina.” Voice never drifts into explanatory tour guide; even the technician’s skepticism is filtered through Elara’s anticipation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; high-pressure beats favor short declaratives—“Evacuate immediately”—while reflective passages stretch without cadence template. No scaffold or synonym loops; “spongey dread” is reused once with added charge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“wall of black water”—and do not stack into purple density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the nail’s transformed value without abstract gloss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-shift noir with maritime-code mystery feels fresh; the jet-stream derailment is backdrop, not allegory. Copper nail as cartographic stylus is a specific, non-obvious affordance that retroactively justifies its survival. “Reversible exile” concept is rarely dramatized at this scale. Risk is moderate—tsunami-as-retribution borders trope—but the geologic link to ancestral misjudgment keeps it from gimmick.</comment>
