<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s curiosity-as-flaw is embodied through tactile ritual (sketching constellations, kneeling in mud) and charged by the recovered memory beat; the renunciation of avoidance lands with visible cost in the final release of the mushroom. Interiority stays concrete, but the single on-page line “profound release and understanding” flirts with label-speak and keeps the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the fairy-ring reflection synchronizes, memory returns, and the mushroom is returned—an earned Charged Poise that reweights the sunken orchard from wound to compass. Causal linkage holds: journal → alignment ritual → memory → release. Cost is legible in the final image of “mended constellations” and the physical act of letting the mushroom go. No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern of broken/cosmic repair is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt-bleached mud, barnacled hulls, and the greenhouse’s iron ribs are filtered through Aris’s folklorist gaze; every sensory note doubles as tool or obstacle (the mast fractures Orion, the tide steers Rigel). The fairy ring itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. One hairline slip: “crisp nostalgia” is declared rather than rendered through sensory cue once, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the stolen memory—tightens through the alignment detection beat; the luminous circle formation is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses denial. Agency is interior (attention, interpretation) yet causally decisive. Cost is felt in the tear-tracked grime and the mushroom’s release. Slight reserve: external pressure remains static; escalation is purely cognitive, keeping the band just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “memory is borrowed, not stolen,” crystallized when the fairy ring’s reflection returns what it once held. Subtext operates in the shipwrecks’ silent vigil and the mushroom’s final immersion—love choosing silence over explanation. No moralizing; the reweighting is imagistic. The concept is coherent yet slightly safe; it does not risk a darker counter-reading that would push it into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholarly yet visceral—“grain of wood, texture of soil.” Rhythm modulates from long observational sentences to the staccato “He had detected the alignment.” No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Voice stays consistent under peak pressure; the final paragraph’s lift into lyric cadence is earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“iron ribs twisted like a beached leviathan’s skeleton” grounds scale and decay. One negligible loop: “remember to be curious. Remember to look” is deliberate anaphora, not artifact. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the mended constellations resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring-as-memory-vault reconfigures folkloric trope into personal cosmogram; shipwrecks-as-guardians is fresh without exoticism. The star-map cipher avoids generic portal fantasy by anchoring decryption in tactile fieldwork. Risk is present but modest—no formal experimentation—keeping the score below 9.0. Specificity of salt-bleached orchard and mycological threshold feels singular.</comment>
