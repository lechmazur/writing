<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to Silas vs. revulsion at his lies—stay active in-scene (ink pot as catalyst, hands on corpse). The final integration offer is earned by prior causal chain; cost is felt in the promise to “redact names,” a concrete forfeiture. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic. Only cap keeps this from 9+: no second on-page character to test status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the asylum equation reweights “fair” from subtraction to integration, with visible cost—she must protect former victims while risking retaliation. Causal lens holds throughout: ink pot → softens dilemma → proposal → breach. Orientation anchored by word 25; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint (threat from father’s circle) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prep-room micro-setting constrains every move: refrigeration hum sets cadence, stainless steel geometry forces her to write beside embalming tools, corpse-as-object supplies moral pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—funeral director’s daughter notices antiseptic vs. iron ink. Final image of dawn through stained glass reuses setting to mark threshold. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape father’s legacy—tightens once: from either/or (betray vs. inherit) to integrative third path. Escalation is causal under lens: each absorption of room truth raises cost of returning to old binary. Price is legible: she commits to shielding minor players, inviting retaliation. One meaningful turn suffices at 755 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fair trade” emerges from concrete negotiation draft, not assertion. Final image of indigo ink drying to “certain” color reweights opening rumor without moralizing. Complexity preserved: Silas remains loved yet lethal. No thematic echo penalty—no character spells out thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—brass pot “felt heavy with history,” a con artist’s daughter’s metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during reflection, clipped “Tonight, she needed that fluidity” under urgency. No head-hop; diction within 23-year-old lexicon. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“She uncapped the pot; the scent… cut through the antiseptic sterility” advances action, atmosphere, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse and precise. Strong verbs—“ink bloomed,” “dawn bled”—avoid purple. Copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: political asylum sought not from nation but from paternal mythology, using forensic con-analysis as currency. Risky interior setting—funeral prep table—becomes engine rather than backdrop. Transformation test fails if names changed: ink pot, corpse, and redaction clause are irreplaceable. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
