<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and particular; the clipboard and chalk code act as embodied emotional catalysts. The final micro-choice—renaming “Aurora”—is earned by the prior deciphering beat and carries visible cost (abandoning Lyra/Corbin). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only sequential reflection, keeping this just below 9. Still, the motivation arc is coherent, personal, and tightly scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wax-sealed letter and chalk-dust shoes re-weight the premise with felt cost. Causal chain is intact—code prompts renaming prompts mailing—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 84; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint (surface-mail slowness) shapes the final ritual. One causal micro-turn suffices at this length; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Golden arcade, clipboard, and chalk function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only here can Elara read the child-code that rewrites her pseudonym. Selective sensory layering (ozone, jasmine, wax smell) filters through POV priorities. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, rise, walk, mailbox slot. Environment actively supplies the pivotal cipher rather than postcard backdrop, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the true name that honors a love’s end—is signaled early and tightens once: the chalk code eliminates both prior candidates, forcing a third. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of symbols (galaxy, bird, seven) reweights emotional cost rather than narrows external options. Price is legible—she forfeits hours of crafted work and embraces ephemeral child-art. No reversal, but single deepening suffices at 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: meaning is discovered in overlooked margins, not curated archives. Children’s chalk re-prices Elara’s professional craft, translating “carefully inventive” into humble reception. Final image—dust on shoes—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through objects rather than declaration; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is architecturally visual, synaesthetic (“holographic koi beside real sparrows”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, crisp verb bursts for mailing beat. No head-hop; diction stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon. Filter verbs are few and purposeful. Distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; figurative language is selective, pattern-taught (“digital ghosts / tangible thread”). No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor cluster—“living tapestry of futuristic nostalgia”—but it lands early, not at closure, and is coherent within POV. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combines pseudonym artistry, surface-mail resistance, and child-code cipher in a synthesis that feels specific and non-obvious. Futuristic nostalgia is treated as integrated aesthetic, not contradiction. Chalk galaxy beside hopscotch is image-virgin and thematically productive. Risk lies in quiet epiphany over plot twist; coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
