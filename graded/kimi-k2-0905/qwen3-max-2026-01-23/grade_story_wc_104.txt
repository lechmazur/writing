<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s patient vigilance is credibly rooted in embodied ritual (the arrow, the keys) and her final “staggering grace” stance feels earned by twelve years of solitude. The interior contradiction—chain as prison vs. root—is dramatized only in the last paragraph; earlier beats summarize rather than show simultaneous impulses. Micro-choices are present (lifting the false bottom, pressing the arrow) but lack immediate opposing pull, so the chain never truly tests her tactics until the symbol flips at the end. Still, the renunciation of force and the visible crew bow supply sufficient cost to clear the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: decoding the keys → opens panel → halts bulldozer; each step tightens options under a situational lens. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—destruction impeded by shared awe, foreclosing the wall’s demolition with conceptual cost (the foreman’s vow). Orientation is anchored by word 26; no penalty. The only drag is a single causality leap: the crew’s instantaneous, uniform reverence feels convenient, trimming the score from 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The carnival prize hall is vividly etched—dust motes, glass-eyed bears, skylight slant—and the cedar vault’s golden exhale contrasts perfectly. Micro-setting works: the piano bench (tool) constrains every tactical move. Spatial tracking is flawless; the three paces and hairline seam read clear. The bulldozer’s shadow-as-sundial is the image that charges the final moment, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“save the seeds”—is signaled early and sharpened by the noon deadline. One meaningful tightening: decoding the keys pivots the threat from certain collapse to possible sanctuary. Cost is visible (twelve years, iron wrist, symbolic chain) and alters tactics—she opts for revelation, not obstruction. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the panel opens; the crew’s capitulation is too frictionless to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet, patient resistance emerges through keys-as-constellations and grass-as-fletching; no authorial sermon. The reweighting of chains into roots supplies a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in the foreman’s hat-removal carries the social shift. Only the final “planted resilience” skirts echo-of-prompt, holding it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s calibrated attention—dust arcs, key tarnish, seed labels. Syntax lengthens under awe (“Golden light flooded…”) then compresses at the turn (“She spoke no words.”). No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction—is justified by the climax’s conceptual stakes, keeping the 9-band quick test in reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only three metaphors in the last beat, each purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“resilience… resilient”) is minor. Information density high; every line advances image or tactic. A single filter verb stack (“felt the iron manacle loosen… felt warm”) is tolerated under emotional release, capping at 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Seed-archive-in-carnival is a fresh synthesis; Orion key-map feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric stillness instead of explosive protest—heightens coherence without gimmickry. The arrow-grass fletching particularizes the world; no off-the-shelf eco-hero tropes. Not quite groundbreaking enough for 9.0, but memorable and specific.</comment>
