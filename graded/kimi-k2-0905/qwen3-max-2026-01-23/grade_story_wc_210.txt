<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her rejection of nostalgia is shown via the bottle’s warmth, not told. Motive (revive the Cove through craft) is stable, but the moment of conception lacks visible contradiction or cost; it feels too smooth. A micro-flaw rather than a full earned rupture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: because magic is gone, therefore Elara conceives a craft-based future; the buried bottle is the decisive act with conceptual cost (she relinquishes the wish era). Closure lands clean under Causal lens, cost legible in “silent vow.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt-laden wind, splintered posts, rice-paper beats—selective sensory triage mirrors Elara’s disciplined attention. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains her acceptance strategy; final image of soil-pressed bottle charges the empty plaza.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory replace magic?—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental: each recalled artisan skill tightens the blueprint until the greenhouse sketch forecloses the old wish-altar path. No reversal, but a coherent because/therefore narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: craft > miracle. No abstract sermon; whispered line “We honor ancestors by embodying their wisdom” is the only overt cue, placed late enough to feel earned. Final lantern-glow image reweights the earlier crimson lanterns without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Elara’s sensorium: “salt-laden wind whispered,” “skeletal remains”—diction stays within her alchemical register. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences for memory, crisp verbs for present action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence = scent of pine resin + lantern frames + rice-paper beat. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“tattered crimson lanterns… forgotten tears”). No loops; occasional adjective pairs (“dust and memory”) read deliberate rather than padded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-magic ghost town rebuilt via artisanal memory rather than steampunk tech or nostalgic spell. Bottle-with-no-opening as constraint-not-key feels novel. Risk—quiet climax of planting paper—pays off because the conceptual cost is legible.</comment>
