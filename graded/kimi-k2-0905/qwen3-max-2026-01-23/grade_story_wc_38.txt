<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific, her danced lexicon embodying contradiction under pressure; the vow to “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through micro-choices that cost her isolation and grime-tears, earning the final quiet rebellion. No stock labels—every beat is filtered through her perceptual loom. Flaw: we never feel her body fail or mis-remember under water-cold stress; competence edges toward immaculate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the buoy’s breach reweights Thorne’s despair into solidarity, the price the lab-tomb’s irrevocable silence and her sole endurance. Causal chain holds—dice → listen → third chime → valve—each because/therefore link tight under 700 words. No teleporting props; journal & dice are anchored early. Cost is legible: “a tear traced clean through grime” forecloses rescue for her, liberates the data.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken lab is not backdrop but instrument: salt-crusted valve, hourly pressure chime, dying lights constrain every tactic. Body-as-micro-setting: dancer’s spine and cradling arms become the tactile map that deciphers the lock. Final image recharges same watery twilight, now humming with “quiet triumph.” Specificity never stalls momentum—each detail is noticed because it must be used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn isolation into bridge—tightens once: the dice force “LISTEN” which collapses ambient noise into the single chime that must be acted on. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded line adds filamental pressure until the third chime narrows options to one precise valve turn. Price is felt: the groan of seals releases her only companion (the buoy) leaving her alone with salt-cold wheel marks on palms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: vulnerability encrypted into strength is shown first as danced spiral, last as buoy-cradling release. “To be seen in brokenness” is never stated aloud; it’s reenacted when Elara offers her upturned palms to the dying lights. The final reconfiguration—indifference turned cradle—earns contemplative afterglow. No moral, only charged image: lone dancer under emergency lights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is ocean-soaked lyric: syntax lengthens like sediment settling, then slices sharp on “sharp hand gestures mimicked dice tumbling.” Perceptual signature—loom, web, filament—remains character-bound; no filter-verb stacks. Compression taught early (“time unfolded precisely as a spider spins”) pays off in final spiral. Rhythmic control mirrors pressure: breath syncs with ocean pulse without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear varies cadence; sentence openings diversify from participial to subject-verb. Figurative density is high but patterned—“skeletal sentinels,” “silken thread”—and justified by lyric mode; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “quiet triumph of intention” echoes “quiet vow” without new charge, a −0.2 artifact. Otherwise information-dense: one sentence often layers setting, tool, and emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater cryptographer who dances ciphers. Dice-as-runes and chime-as-code transform stock escape-room trope into choreographed epistemology. Risk—lyric ellipses, danced exposition—pays off when valve turn precision is legible. Could not swap place-names without breaking oceanic breath-sync and loom imagery. Conceptual integrity sustained: no retreat from salt-crushed silence.</comment>
