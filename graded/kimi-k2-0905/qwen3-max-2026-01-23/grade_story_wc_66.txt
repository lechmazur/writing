<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—Elara’s needle-and-ink precision, her pulse “frantic drum,” the dust-mote sermon all body forth a compulsive archivist. Contradictory impulse (fear vs. vow) is present but stays largely parallel rather than colliding inside a single beat; the final stance is earned yet cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Still, voice, sensorium, and micro-choices cohere into an individual psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she “was no longer merely a copyist” – conceptual re-pricing with felt cost (radio silenced, cloak’s weight, journal’s heft). Accumulative lens holds: lyrical fragments tighten toward the final crystallization; no causal reversal is required. Orientation is clean by word 80; all rules taught early remain consistent to the hush at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ember alcove, frost-veined pane, and the shortwave’s green dial function as micro-setting that literally constrains action—cloak must muffle glow, posture bent over parchment. Sensory hierarchy obeys a copyist’s priorities: ink, static, dust, pulse of coals. Mist never becomes mere wallpaper; it softens at the close, cueing dawn and release of vigilance. Spatial choreography is intimate yet precise throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep listening/transcribing without being discovered—tightens once when interference crackles and the cloak slips. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the lyric lens; the single intensification is sufficient. Price is implied (exposure risk, the silence she must now carry alone) but not made physically concrete; hence stops just short of the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as silenced culture slowly re-seeded by clandestine art; no editorial statement required. Final image—“the dust was listening”—re-weights every prior ink stroke with quietly cosmic stakes. Ambiguity survives: is this hope or delusion? Complexity holds. No tidy moral, only invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyricism stays calibrated to a meticulous copyist’s ear: “cartographer charting forgotten lands,” “needle stitching silence back into song.” Rhythm swells and contracts with signal fade; cadence mirrors radio static without gimmick. Perceptual signature is unmistakable; no head-hop or register drift. Under peak tension diction compresses to breath-length clauses, then opens into oak-leaf wonder—exactly the modulation demanded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence music is purposeful: long metaphoric spirals accrue like orchestral phrases, then break into staccato fragments at interference crackle. Information density high—almost every clause does double duty (scenework + symbolism). One mixed-metaphor cluster (“thistled calm” / “orange heartbeat” / “swallowing mist”) skirts purple but pattern is taught early and recurs, so coherence survives. Zero paraphrase loops or filler verbs inside critical beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-narrative-famine pirate broadcasts embedded in song lyrics feel novel yet inevitable; copyist as ghost-gardener is fresh. Concept synthesizes censorship, memory, and music transcription without meta-commentary. Dust-to-story alchemy is specific to this voice; swap professions and the magic collapses. Risk level moderate—lyric accrual over plot—but payoff justifies the gamble.</comment>
