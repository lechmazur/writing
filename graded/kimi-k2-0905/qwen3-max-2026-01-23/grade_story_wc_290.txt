<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait collide in every beat: she measures steps, fights panic, and still climbs the loft. The internal contradiction—fear vs responsibility—drives every micro-choice; her refusal to retreat carries the village’s survival as visible cost. The compass-handling and single organ chord are concrete, character-specific actions that externalize her spine. Final tear-tracked acceptance of permanent fear is earned stasis with price.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the nexus mutinies, therefore she must sound the organ; because the C-major chord reverberates, the geometry yields and the alcove appears. Closure is a Decisive Change—passages open, Key obtained—paid for by her endured terror (visible cost: “tears traced clean paths”). Compass glow and alcove revelation are tightly linked effects; no teleporting props. Organ journal fragment is seeded early, paid off in climax; no outline-like sequencing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Star-slivered nexus, writhing stone lines, and ivory keys are sensory, selective, POV-filtered. The compass acts as micro-setting that literally points the final choice; the organ loft’s claustrophobic squeeze constrains her breathing and timing. Spatial choreography is clean: arches lean, walls press, aperture widens in tracked sequence. Environment mirrors interior—stone rebellion externalizes her panic—yet avoids overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—end the village’s starvation—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when retreat is foreclosed (“retreat meant condemning…”). Escalation is causal: each spatial betrayal narrows escape options, forcing ascent into the loft (visible cost: sweat, hitched breath). Organ chord is protagonist-agency turn that converts spatial mutiny into harmonic passage. Price is endured claustrophobic trauma; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: spatial rebellion quelled not by conquest but by listening—melody as dialogue across centuries. Subtext resides in the organ’s scarred pipes and the compass’s warm glow—tools of creation versus measurement reconciled. Final image of starlight as benediction reweights earlier threat into blessing. No moralizing; the tear-streaked face is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-close distance stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is precise—drafting compass, ivory keys, star-dust chill—filtered through Elara’s surveyor-granddaughter bias. Syntax mirrors pressure: long clause when arches lean, staccato when panic spikes. “Walls…pressed close, the starlight above narrowing to a sliver” is rhythmic compression under stress. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within explorer-carpenter lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, taught, and paid off: “carved lines writhed like serpents” prefigures spatial mutiny; “reverberation…unfolded like liquid light” is the single allowed flourish at climax. Paragraph lengths breathe with pace—short at panic, elongate at wonder. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes promise. No grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobia + architectural mutiny + church organ tuning space-time. Compass-as-dowsing-rod and organ-as-keyboard-to-reality transform familiar props. Spatial rebellion made audible is non-obvious; conventional quest would smash walls, not harmonize them. Risk—confined loft scene inside already mutinous space—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of petrified heartwood gear keeps concept grounded.</comment>
