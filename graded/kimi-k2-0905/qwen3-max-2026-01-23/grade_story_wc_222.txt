<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s thief-code, mentor reverence, and playful awe are dramatized through micro-choices—hefting the shattered sundial, swapping isolation-pieces for patient-growth pawns—so motives stay embodied. The closing renunciation (“he had not stolen; he had restored”) is earned by the causal chain of piece-by-piece swaps that visibly cost him physical exhaustion and spiritual risk. Interior contradiction flickers only once: “spirit alight” vs. “tears froze,” yet the beat lands as awe, not lapse. Sufficient for 9+, but the single-POV isolation means no relational crucible to test the code under another will.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each chess swap tightens sky-sickness relief while ice-spire groans escalate physical danger, narrowing exit options. Orientation is anchored by word 42; no drift. Closure is a Decisive Change—healed sky, transformed lid, forfeited thief-identity—paid for by seven winters of carving and summit oxygen debt. Cost is legible in the final line: “greatest theft was… giving back,” a Conceptual Repricing that re-weights his entire vocation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire, bruised-violet sky, and moonlight pedestal are filtered through Kael’s climber-bias: he clocks fracture patterns for handholds, reads sky as cosmic wound. Cherry vs. shadow-wood chess cores supply tactile micro-setting that literally rewrites reality, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Temperature, vertigo, and golden dawn wash are motion-integrated, never listed. Spatial choreography survives the zero-G board hover because the swaps are one-handed and tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the sky or leave world nauseating—signaled in first 120 words. Each piece-switch escalates by shrinking the violet-green lesion and increasing spire instability, a because/therefore loop. One meaningful tightening: the healer-queen swap triggers golden eruption that forces final gardener-king placement under collapsing ceiling. Cost is cumulative frostbite risk and irreversible identity shift from taker to restorer, visible in closing lid-glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—restoration over acquisition—emerges through opposed wood types and closing reversal of “theft.” No moralizing line states it; the lid’s aligned constellations reweight mentor’s earlier “reflects truth, not time.” Subtext lives in micro-gestures: cold brass against heart = stolen guilt; warm glow = absolution. Ambiguity lingers—will the code survive without sky-crisis?—inviting reflection without tidy axiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s mountaineer perceptions: “muscles burning,” “dizzying fractured patterns,” syntax shortening under summit hypoxia. Distinct idiom—“apprentice of wonder,” “sacredly playful reverence”—threads through without repeating. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Psychic distance cleanly snaps from panoramic sky to shard-level ice reflection, teaching the lens early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from crystalline noun clusters to breath-dash fragments, mirroring altitude strain. No synonym loops; “swap,” “replace,” “exchange” are functionally distinct moves. Metaphors (sleeping sentinels, bruised violet) remain single-layer and physically coherent. One scaffold spotted—“the spire groaned, but the oppressive hum softened”—yet the contrast serves pressure, not padding; not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sky-healing via chess-piece soul-graft fuses fantasy trope with artisanal heist, rendered specific by seven-winter cherry carving and climber-thief ethic. Risk—quiet, tactile restoration instead of battle—pays off in Conceptual Repricing. Mentor’s aphorism and pocket lid recur with shifted value, proving pattern inevitability. Could not transpose to generic wizard quest without collapsing world logic.</comment>
