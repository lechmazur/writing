<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“constant hum beneath his skin”); micro-choice of sealing the case costs him the tactile connection he covets, earned by diary’s last line. No contradictory impulse on-page keeps him from 9+. Sensory empathy is shown, not labelled; historian’s refusal to surrender fragment to flames is credible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers resonance until the closing palm-to-wall Charged Poise reweights the silo from grain store to “harvest of human spirit.” Orientation anchored by word 40; cost is the historian’s own isolation sealed into the case. Closure is on-page, undeniable, irreversible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silo curvature, bronze shaft, diary ash—selective sensory triad that constrains handling of fragile relics and charges final image. Micro-setting of oak desk and preservation case act as crucible for the sealing choice. Spatial choreography clean; no credibility slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the dream-space alive—tightens once: after reading Elara’s “last dream,” he must seal the fragment, forfeiting immediate communion. Agency is present, cost is legible; only one deepening keeps it from higher band.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern—tapestry threads, diary ashes, dragon eyes—culminating in Conceptual Repricing: memory itself can mend a displaced cosmos. No moralizing; final image of “dragon’s wingbeat” inside metal offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity preserved: beauty saved first is both mercy and wound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect clings to historian’s hushed, tactile register; syntactic rhythm lengthens under reverence, shortens under ash-handling. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“whispers trapped in stone”) distinct and consistent. Filter verbs serve voice, not clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density—lines carry atmosphere, character, motion simultaneously. One paraphrase loop (“stories walls have heard” echoed twice) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors unified; no mixed vehicles. Final cadence slows to match sealing act, propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic archive in a grain silo feels inevitable yet fresh; tapestry fragment as resilient seed rather than MacGuffin. Dragons mending sky via memory reconfigures familiar eco-collapse trope into interior cosmology. Risk of lyric stasis paid off by on-page cost.</comment>
