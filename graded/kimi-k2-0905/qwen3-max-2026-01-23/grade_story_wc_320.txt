<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and particular—“fantasy practicality” is lived, not labeled. Contradictory impulses (quest vs. renunciation) are dramatized in the final beat when she fuses the shard to the dial, foreclosing retreat. Micro-choices (discarding assumptions one by one) externalize values under pressure. Cost is visible: lifelong quest re-configured into permanent stillness.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discarded assumption thickens the quiet until the seed-note blooms. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shard fused to the dial crystallizes her new listener-stance with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and stay stable. No causal breaks; moon, gorge, and receiver co-act rather than merely decorate.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Spire, gorge, and lunar perigee are not backdrops but active constraints—moon literally pulls the static, gorge swallows discarded beliefs. Micro-setting (the shard fused to the dial) charges the final image. Sensory economy favors haptic and auditory detail over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless—body, harness, dial, and wind track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hear the first breath inside the last sigh—is signaled early and tightened by each discarded filter. One meaningful deepening: when “silence” flips from emptiness to genesis, options narrow to irreversible stillness. Cost is legible—she pays with her former identity as seeker. No coincidence; lunar pull and tower resonance are environmental antagonists she must out-listen.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: silence as plenum, ending as origin. Final image (shard fused to dial) reweights every prior signal-hunt into stillness without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—touching the shard is prayer, not data entry. Ambiguity is purposeful: she becomes antenna, surrendering agency to become conduit.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distilled, almost liturgical—compression taught early (“steel lattices and skeletal antennas”) and paid off in the hush-cadence of the ending. Perceptual signature is celestial-engineer precise: “lunar-tugged wind,” “seed-note before time.” No head-hopping; single POV stays tight. Filter verbs serve lyric rhythm, not padding.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the wind-gusts and receiver hiss. Sentence variety is deliberate: long anaphoric accumulations mirror assumption-shedding; final paragraph fragments into quiet. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances stance or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise is familiar—mystic radio at world’s edge—but transformed by shard-of-hush physics and “fantasy practicality” vocation. Hollywood star fragment retooled from kitsch relic to silence fossil is fresh inflection. Risky quiet ending commits fully; no retreat to spectacle. If relocated to another tower, the emotional arc would collapse—specificity is integral.</comment>
