<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile perception of metal fatigue and her refusal to "guess" give her credible artisan authority; the quiet sovereignty stance, however, edges toward idealization rather than flaw. No interior contradiction surfaces once pressure rises—the calm never cracks—so the arc is less a change than a demonstration. Still, micro-choices (warming resin, tracing the joint) embody motive cleanly and the release beat carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test enough for high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unbroken river of light in the basin confirms success and re-weights Elara’s covenant with hope; cost is the departing drone itself, now beyond her reach. The water-diagnosis rule is taught early, used in midpoint escalation, and repaid in the final image—no retroactive fixes. Causal chain (fracture → water test → patch → re-test → release) is intact under a single continuous scene; depot bell and hummingbird hum provide external clocks that keep orientation secure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Depot haze, cedar-oil air, and slate basin form an integrated micro-setting that actively filters perceptual choices for a blind protagonist; the shifting water light literally guides the repair decision. Every sensory note is filtered through Elara’s professional priorities—no tourist catalogue. The environment constrains the final gesture: only the open archway gives the drone exit vector, marrying spatial choreography to closure image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the drone must fly before the anchor lifts—is signaled by the harbor-bell countdown and tightens through two causal beats: discovery of fracture, application of patch. Escalation is linear, not reversals, but the clock narrows options and the final cost (her irrevocable release of the repaired emissary) is legible. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; coincidence is absent. Depth sufficient for this length but only one meaningful tightening, so shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "listening as sight" emerges organically from Elara’s method; no character moralizes it. The water-light image returns reweighted—first as diagnostic tool, finally as proof of wholeness—supplying non-literal resonance. Final whispered blessing offers Charged Poise rather than tidy wisdom, meeting the 9+ quick test, yet a slight illustrative sweetness in phrasing ("sacred duty") keeps it just below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s tactile perceptions; diction of "resin," "conductive silver dust," "spider-silk brush" belongs to an artisan’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens during calm, shortens at patch moment ("It was whole.")—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; free indirect slips are clean. Distinct perceptual signature satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; stacked metaphors are disciplined—only one per high-pressure beat. Information density high: "moonstone-infused resin, warmed...pliable as honey" does double sensorial and plot work. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffolding. A single near-purple phrase ("perpetual pearl-gray haze") survives but does not touch closure, permitting high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Using a blind protagonist’s water-refraction test to diagnose micro-fractures in a drone feels fresh and specific; it grows naturally from character rather than gimmick. Depot-mist trope is familiar but repurposed as sensory medium, not wallpaper. No famous-scene echoes; concept commits fully. Risk is moderate—quiet stakes, lyric closure—so stays below 9.</comment>
