<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leeward’s vocation and embodied calm feel lived-in; every strike of the mallet is a micro-choice that visibly sharpens the cost of failure. Memory of a drowned coast gives the final earned stasis a bone-deep ache. Interiority stays anchored to salt, wood, and sound—no generic prophet clichés.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriented by line 3; the recursive nautilus is an early causal trigger that tightens through each dub until the closing chord reconfigures storm into lullaby. Cost is palpable: the mallet hums with spent purpose and the orchard drifts on borrowed resonance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options foreclosed, pressure undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating orchard, whalebone mallet, and salt-stained Heartwood are not backdrop; they delimit range of motion and supply the literal instrument of survival. Driftwood circle, wave slap, and apple thud supply tactile markers that charge the final silence. Setting constrains every beat—no drift into white-room vagueness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single tightening arc: interpret spiral → sketch → dub lattice → invite storm. Agency never relinquishes to coincidence; the price is the prophet’s spent stamina and the orchard’s perpetual dependence on his song. Stakes stay legible—if the lattice fails, trees and prophet sink together.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obstacle-as-instrument emerges through action, not sermon: each fractal line is a question posed to chaos, answered by resonant dub. The grandmother echo at the end re-prices the entire premise—force yields to song—without moralizing. Theme accrues via timber, salt, and spent whalebone, never abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at the prophet’s shoulder, filtering every image through cloud-reading perception; syntax lengthens and contracts with the rising wind. "Restless euphony" is not decorative—it is the story’s heartbeat, modulated from threat to lullaby. Compression and repetition are pattern-taught early and paid off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors the escalating storm—short strikes for dubs, longer coils for cloud spirals; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors (wind like water round stone) stay physically coherent. Only a hairline slip—“thread of intention woven into twilight” flirts with abstraction, but the next line grounds it in vibrating driftwood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The fractal-xylophone storm-negotiation premise feels sui generis, yet the emotional engine—grief transmuted into preservation—roots it in recognizable human need. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into gimmick; instead it renders the orchard’s survival inseparable from song. Transformation succeeds: swap any detail and the whole edifice fails.</comment>
