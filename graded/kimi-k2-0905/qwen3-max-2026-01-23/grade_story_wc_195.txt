<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “withdrawn knight” is enacted through guarded motion and armor-scar silence; interior contradiction surfaces when nostalgia for the vow collides with present solitude. The final release of the puppet visibly externalizes his shift from isolation to threshold-guardian, paying the cost of surrendered fixed fate. Flaws—emotional summary in “shivering bliss” and one stock phrase—keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of program → memory trigger → patterned choreography → puppet release → dawn. Each beat tightens options until only the brass clasp remains; unsnapping it lands Decisive Change with cosmic sigh cost. Orientation anchors by line 4; transitions are smooth, no ellipsis or ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Alchemical greenhouse supplies live obstacles—Möbius paths, mercury drip, philosopher’s rose—that force footfall choices. The marionette’s sorrowwood body doubles as micro-setting whose brass clasp must be interfaced with; its slack limbs charge the final image. Sensory economy favors luminous functional detail over tourist catalog; spatial logic tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture possibility’s shape”—is signaled early; pressure mounts when geometry warps and only the clasp-release survives as live option. One meaningful tightening: pivot beneath sorrowwood → mercury freeze → east bow → clasp; each move forecloses alternatives. Cost is the knight’s fixed identity; felt in the universe-sigh and puppet slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship vs. bound fate emerges through puppet-king image and clasp release rather than statement. Allegiance vow reframed from chain to bridge in final reprise; possibility-as-dawn answers thematic question without moralizing. Subtext resides in slack marionette = slack destiny. No echoic thesis speech; resonance lands in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person tight keeps to Kael’s perceptual filter—scarred armor, pearl-crush under boot. Syntax lengthens during ritual dance, then fragments at unsnap moment (“softer than a heartbeat”) to mimic release. No head-hop; diction stays within chivalric-alchemic register. Minor filter-verb trio in greenhouse intro prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variance mirrors breath of choreography; long sentence for path curvature, single clause for clasp click. Figurative layer dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence can anchor setting, object, memory. One paraphrase loop “quiet quiet” knocked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing alchemical greenhouse, puppet theatre, and knight-errancy yields fresh mythic texture rather than checklist. Puppet-as-self trope inverted: release is triumph, not loss. Dawn-after-eternal-night feels earned via orchard sigh, not contrived. Risk of ornate diction justified by voice; concept stays specific rather than generic “chosen one” arc.</comment>
