<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment versus ritual devotion—are dramatized in the moment she flat-lines the sensors yet chooses to keep listening; her embodied tears at the grandmother-music-box reprise make the cost of vulnerability immediate and irreversible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lab’s paradigm flips from excavation to cultivation, the lens literally handed off with the directive “gently question,” leaving Dr. Aris—and the space—poised in fertile silence; the carbide lens threads every beat, fracturing both light and belief, so the reconfiguration is earned, visible, and costly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fused-quartz Resonator, carbide lens, and golden-shadow pool function as micro-setting: the lens’s rotation steers the final sonic awakening, while the shadowed cathedral architecture externalizes Elara’s internal shift, grounding the逼textural stakes in tactile space without generic lab filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending silence through reciprocal vulnerability—tightens when Elara’s prism-song deliberately crashes the sensors, trading archival certainty for emotional risk; the price (public failure, tear-stained cheeks) is legible on the page and irreversible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Connection-as-gardening emerges concretely: sterile specimen cases versus sprouting memory-shadows reweights the concept without sermon; the grandmother’s music-box return re-prices earlier “loss” into co-creative silence, delivering resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance, mirroring bell resonance—“soft as a struck bell,” “hummed—not a sensor reading, but a warmth”—syntax lengthens then compresses with chime cadence, keeping perceptual signature consistent and taught without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Few loops; high density—“liquid amber,” “fertile silence”—each metaphor advances texture rather than decorates; no mixed vehicles clutter the climax, allowing the final “music box melody lingered in the golden shadows” to land clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “lab of lost sounds” trope is inverted into a garden requiring active vulnerability; lens-as-prism seeding memory is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable once enacted—risk that heightens stakes without gimmick, transformed through Elara’s specific lineage and tactile ritual.</comment>
