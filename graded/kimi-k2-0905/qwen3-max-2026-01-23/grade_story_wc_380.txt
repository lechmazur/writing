<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s ache for her erased sister is palpable in the wildflowers and every micro-choice to climb, touch, and whisper; the salt-geode surrender feels earned because her calloused fingers and sailor reflexes have already bled intention earlier. Still, interiority flirts with poetic labels (“gleaming silence”) that slightly generalise corporeal specificity at peak beat, holding her just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal track is rock-steady: whale → coffee spiral → chamber → gravity shifts → memory restored, each step a clear therefore that tightens options. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—wildflowers entombed, gravity stilled, vocation reframed—paying off every prior cue; the single transition (dock→cliff) is legible and early anchors hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Harbour dusk, gravel path, and prismatic salt cavern are sketched with economy yet filtered through Elara’s lantern-eye: texture, colour, and hazard (fluctuating gravity) constrain each footstep. The salt crystals act as both scenery and tool—she literally stakes memory inside them—so environment charges the final image, meeting the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memory—tightens once: spiral read → chamber risk → palm-to-crystal renunciation. Gravity surges supply visible hazard, but the middle offers only one meaningful deepening; options narrow cleanly yet lack a second reversal or tangible resource lost, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mourning & collective amnesia cohere without sermon: theme emerges through salt sealing the wildflowers and her quiet vow to “tend memory’s light.” Final image re-weights the premise—memories await retrieval—yet avoids tidy moral, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sailor diction (“calloused from rope and steel”, “salt-heavy air”) with rhythmic variation and no head-hop. Occasional elevated phrase (“gleaming silence”) is repeated enough to read as intentional motif, not register drift; perceptual signature is intact under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory filter). Three adjacent “gleaming silence” echoes flirt with loop but function as accumulative cadence; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscure beats, sustaining clarity through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-memory archaeology via salt-geode gravity pockets is fresh, and coffee-ground divination grounds the magic in folkloric specificity. Whale inciting event is less transformed—mythic-stranding trope—so synthesis feels neat rather than revelatory, capping short of 8.8.</comment>
