<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “sensibly eccentric” persona is shown through disciplined ritual (aligning the compass, refusing the vial) that costs her the very trophy her trade values; the internal pivot from hunter to witness is embodied, not declared. Psychometry beat gives concrete micro-choice pressing the cracked glass that floods her senses and tilts her stance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—only after the vision does she renounce sampling—so the final renunciation feels 90 % earned rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: returning the compass and abandoning the vial visibly foreclose her original goal with conceptual cost—“wonder begins where explanation ends” reweights the whole quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the premise until the lagoon’s reflectionless surface breaks the pattern and forces surrender. The 120-word anchor clears factory/mountain/after-hours; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final gesture; persistent constraint (no artifact, no scent) shapes the exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lagoon’s reflectionless surface and impossible curvature directly constrain perception and become the image that reweights meaning—meets 9+ gate. Selective scent details (mineral cousin of petrichor) filter through collector’s bias. Spatial choreography tracks lantern beam → brass glint → kneel → restore compass; no drift. Factory silence above is reused as returned gift, anchoring time without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find where explanations fail—tightens when compass needle denies north and lagoon denies reflection, forcing surrender. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Visible cost: she abandons her professional currency (scent vial) and future bragging rights. Could use one earlier micro-choice under pressure to hit 8+ band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collector’s refusal to collect: surrender to awe is dramatized, not preached. Final reweighting of mapping/safety trope is inevitable yet non-moralizing. One soft spot: Thorne’s journal line “seeking only truth” flirts with thematic echo, but it’s buried mid-text and doesn’t replace closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—scent priorities, stone textures, brass cold. Syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens during sensorial flood, mirroring pulse without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to test; free indirect cleanly handled. “Sensibly eccentric” risks label-speak but is immediately justified by precise strap-adjustment, so voice remains credible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: scent/mineral cousin, needle frozen not northward, swallowing light and sound—each noun does double duty. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative muddle absent. One minor scaffold: “lagoon’s quiet wisdom” is abstractions piled on an already vivid image, but it doesn’t touch the closing sentence. Ear test passes: final line’s cadence clinches the piece without syntactic gimmick.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses scent-hunter with anti-mapper pilgrimage; compass that repels north feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk-taking in refusal to take souvenir tightens theme without gimmick. Slight proximity to “lost explorer’s journal” trope keeps it from 8.8+. Specificity of petrichor cousin and reflectionless water prevents template feel.</comment>
