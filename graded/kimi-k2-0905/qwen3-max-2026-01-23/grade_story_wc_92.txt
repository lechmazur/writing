<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s quietly mutinous interiority stays consistent and embodied (thumb on seam, fist crushing moss). The bronze quill holder becomes an extension of his calmly inventive trait, turning duty into clandestine agency. The only flaw: the “sprouting seed” cipher feels imported rather than grown from earlier image-work, slightly thinning the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is impeccable: blackout → descent → gnomon adjustment → flare → answer pulse. Each beat tightens options and ends with the earned CR image “a silent dawn had already begun to stir,” charging the whole fort with conceptual cost. The blackout-as-canvas rule is taught early and pays off in the final line, satisfying the lens test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystalline walls that “exhaled starlight” and the half-painted sundial as spatial cipher integrate setting into tactic; the fort’s blackout literally enables the revolution’s geometry. Micro-setting (gnomon angle, hidden seam) constrains the decisive move. Only the moss’s phosphorescence slips toward generic fantasy tech; still, the velvet-lined hollow grounds it tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlogged speech—tightens when every degree of gnomon rotation risks exposure. Escalation is single-track but sufficient: the flare costs visibility and cannot be recalled, a felt price that alters later tactics. The blackout clock (true darkness window) supplies urgent coherence without external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-resistance emerges through geometry and bioluminescence, never thesis-stated. The final “silent page” reweights every shadow into potential speech, achieving CR without moralizing. The half-painted dial’s incompleteness quietly argues that official time is unfinished, an insight grown from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric syntax (“winking hush where shadows leaned close”) matches Kael’s inventor precision; no filter-verb clutter. The risk of euphony is controlled: varying sentence lengths keep cadence from crystallizing into chant. Only one moment of register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction intrudes in interiority—but it is brief and forgivable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Precision verbs (“gnomon clicked,” “stone panel slid”) carry propulsion; figurative layer is selective, never thick enough to occlude. Occasional adjacency echo (“luminous fort…luminous moss”) is the single paraphrase loop, minor. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks that mirror Kael’s pauses, tightening the blackout window.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The revolution-through-sundial-angles feels freshly specific, not another lantern-in-the-night uprising. Twilight geometry weaponized as cipher transforms familiar “rebels in castle” premise. Risk is taken and paid off: the blackout-as-canvas concept commits fully, culminating in the charged final image.</comment>
