<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through pattern-hunting and the lie she sustains; the moment she encrypts Psi and accepts guardianship crystallizes a costly, earned shift. The interior contradiction—obedient employee vs clandestine protector—plays out in concrete micro-choices. Flaw: Lena appears only in video, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics cannot score. Final renunciation is credible and scaled to word-count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pattern recognition → hidden terminal → sanctuary discovery → deliberate concealment. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elara knowingly buries the truth, assuming lifelong responsibility. Numbers-as-code and patch-key are set up and paid off without cheat. One soft spot: Director Vance functions as off-stage obstacle rather than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archive air, humming consoles, and the patch’s frayed threads give tactile grounding; the micro-setting of the deprecated terminal acts as pivot. Sensory detail is selective (filtered oxygen, spectral waveforms) and filtered through Elara’s archivist eye. Environment constrains choice—only the forgotten admin port grants access—charging the final image. Meets 9+ gate: the patch catches light in the last line, reweighting meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth vs protect it—tightens when revelation forces Elara to choose complicity or exposure; her lie forecloses reversal. Escalation is single but meaningful: discovery of post-crash video annihilates the “accident” narrative and raises personal risk. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual silence, a guardianship that could end her career. No redundant reversals; coincidence only initiates, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of intentional absence emerges through pattern, not lecture: deleted files as refuge, silence as guardian act. Final image—patch as “compass…silent covenant”—offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in Elara’s report (“case remains unsolved”) carries the real moral weight. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity survives in who else might find Psi.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias—timestamps, waveforms, folk playlists. Syntax tightens under pressure (“Her fingers flew…”). Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but mostly justified by corporate-archival context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythms modulate—long reflective sentences vs staccato discovery beats. High density: one sentence often fuses action, image, and emotional tilt (“Tears traced…deliberate protection”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster during video reveal but does not stall momentum. Closure line earns its hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Digital-oblivion-as-sanctuary flips usual “nothing ever disappears” trope into ethical choice. Patch-micro-key and numeric breadcrumb trail feel specific to this world. Accumulation of folk-song echoes and numeric tattoos creates fresh pattern-language. Risk—quiet ending, no villain confrontation—pays off through guardianship reframing.</comment>
