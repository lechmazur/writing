<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor that crystallizes the ink externalizes her fear without label-speak. The single tear is a micro-choice that credibly flips the magic, making the scar-rewrite feel earned. Motivation stays anchored to the childhood fall and grandmother superstition, giving the final luminous palm a visible cost. The only minor slip: “stories of resilience, not ruin” edges toward thematic statement rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the ink hardens under stress, therefore she must release stress via the tear, which rewrites the scars. The 120-word orientation anchor is met—floating rock, dusk, tea master delay—so no penalty. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scars become a living map, foreclosing the old shame. Cost is legible in the glowing palm and the exhaled breath that ends the ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The granite disc, volatile ink, and crow quill are tactile constraints that shape the ritual steps; the ink’s phase-change directly forces the tear tactic. Weather shift from bruised violet to eastern purple storm anchors the breath-between-storms concept and times the final beat. Spatial choreography remains stable—bare feet, vellum roll, silk cord—no floating props. Environment charges the final image: breeze lifts the prayer flags exactly as the scars ignite, fusing setting and interior shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars or remain defined by them—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when the ink crystallizes. One meaningful tightening: the quiver wrist narrows options to either abort or release via tear; no coincidence rescues her. The price is the permanent glowing narrative on her palm, a social and bodily cost that can’t be undone. Escalation is causal under stress-attribute rules, not repeated loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the scar materiality: trauma is not erased but re-storied. The crow superstition returns as lived ritual rather than nostalgic garnish, reweighting “broken things” into constellation skin. No final-paragraph thesis states this; the image of light-etched survival carries the resonance. Ambiguity remains: the next storm will come, leaving the reader with charged poise rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors mineral and sky imagery befitting a rune scholar. Syntax modulates—long breath-like sentences in calm, clipped fragments during tremor—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Grandmother whisper is italicized memory, not head-hop, and the prose stays within Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“crystallized like frost”—never clogs the high-pressure beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only a hairline slip: “the saturated hush had broken” is slightly abstract, but it follows the embodied exhalation, so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating tea-platform rune ritual feels fresh, yet rooted in tactile stone-and-ink logic rather than gimmick. The ink’s stress-crystal mechanic is a science-fantasy twist that forces emotional honesty, not a late rule patch. Scar-constellation payoff grows inevitably from childhood glass fall and crow superstition, passing the transformation test. Risk in merging magic system with grief therapy is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
