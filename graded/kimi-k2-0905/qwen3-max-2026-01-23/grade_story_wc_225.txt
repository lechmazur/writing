<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s guilt is viscerally embodied—tears that can’t fall, silver thread braided into chess knots—and his micro-choices (thread-sorting as pawn-structure analysis) externalize contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of exile is earned because the decoded tapestry literally reenacts the defensive lesson he failed to teach, so absolution carries a felt, on-page cost. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. Only cap: no second character, so relationship crucible bullet not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael forecloses exile by accepting the lesson he once denied, and the revived village soundscape makes the cost audible. Causal chain holds—each thread he winnows is a because/therefore step toward unlocking the labyrinth. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when). No teleporting props; tapestry cipher is set up early. Persistent constraint: the silver king in his pocket keeps the mistake physically present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen flour cloud and suspended raindrops aren’t picturesque; they constrain Kael’s movement and force the thread-work that solves the lock. Micro-setting—his palm-sized labyrinth—literally charges the final image when it clicks open. Spatial choreography is clean: from well to tapestry to labyrinth, no impossible positions. Weather shift at the end is causal, not symbolic overlay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when each decoded thread mirrors the Scholar’s Mate defense he omitted. One decisive turn: the moonlight thread tug that activates the lock and restarts time; option to remain frozen in guilt is foreclosed. Cost is audible—the village’s resumed hammer and laughter make his past isolation irreversible. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular act of re-weaving a forgotten defense: wisdom is woven from broken strands, not declared. The final image of the silver king in his pocket reweights earlier thread-fidgeting without moralizing. Subtext in the border’s “chaos” mirrors his internal tangle; decoding it externalizes forgiveness. No thematic echo sentence; resonance is left tacit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Kael’s chess-master perception: pawn-structure metaphors, constellation engravings read as openings, “ghostly cloud” judged like a board state. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences tighten into staccato thread-pulls under peak focus. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays close. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for an erudite tutor; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings shift. High density—“silver thread salvaged from a frozen seamstress’s basket” does object + backstory + world rule in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; celestial engravings and chess knots cohere. One paraphrase loop spotted (“frozen… suspended… arrested”) but it serves the stasis motif and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines plague-stasis fairy tale with chess pedagogy guilt; the Scholar’s Mate defense as literal lock-and-key feels non-obvious. Frozen-time trope is refreshed by tactile thread-decoding instead of magical incantation. Transformation test fails: plot only works with chess-specific defensive pattern. Risk in lyric compression pays off—closure chime is a sonic payoff for visual stillness.</comment>
