<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—tool selection, breath rhythm, tactile memory—all grounding her motive. The “rhythm of repair” turns from nostalgia to embodied method, earning her final tears. No contradictory impulses appear mid-action, but the gear swap feels frictionless; a hint of hesitation would sharpen the cost. Still, the mentor’s absence-as-pressure suffuses every beat, so the arc holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored refraction layers density until the cracked gear’s revelation reweights the stake. The silk bundle at 120 words anchors who/where/when; orientation is clean. Closure is a Charged Poise—the re-capped lens crystallizes “honoring over fixing,” with the cost of eternal apprenticeship felt in the ember image. No因果 breaks; every beat adds texture or narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice-flower archway, frost-veined shelves, and mirror multiplication are filtered through Elara’s tool-trained eye, guiding her path. The brass sphere’s cage of light constrains her wrist angle and pick selection, qualifying the micro-setting test. Sensory hierarchy obeys eclipse-locksmith priorities: gleam, temperature, metal scent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from velvet layout to counter-clockwise turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm before his hands stiffen”—is signaled in para 3 and tightened when the fractured gear demands a listening stance. One meaningful deepening: light patterns diagnose wear, shifting her from replacement to re-harmonizing. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: she abandons brute mastery for perpetual humility. No second reversal, but the single intensification suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear imagery: repair as dialogue, not dominion. Final re-capping reprices the premise—mastery is renamed “honoring.” No explicit thesis; the driftwood-to-ember shift carries the reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers: will the mentor ever know? That unsent answer enriches, not obscures, the thematic aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds to Elara’s perceptual signature: clockmaker muscle memory, eclipse-tuned light sensitivity, mechanical metaphors for grief. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then tightens to staccato during “tap, twist, breathe.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The lyrical register stays anchored in occupational diction—no forced purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from frost-hush to gear-hum. Metaphors are sparse under the high-pressure cap twist, preventing muddle. One filter-verb cluster (“felt like a heartbeat”) is earned nostalgia, not clutter. No loops, no synonym churn; information density stays high without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Lunar-eclipse locksmith” is fresh, and the hall-of-mirrors clock core fuses celestial and horological in one image. Driftwood nostalgia transformed into ember avoids sentimental reset. While the prophecy scavenger hunt is familiar, the tactile repair epiphany reweights it. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off in mirrored cadence.</comment>
