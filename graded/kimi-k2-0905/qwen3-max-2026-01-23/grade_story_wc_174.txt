<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—calligrapher hands, puppet guilt, the stick’s warmth—yet the “uncommonly serene” label is asserted more than dramatized after the first paragraph; still, the renunciation of control is credible because it grows from the stick’s remembered purpose and costs him his prior identity as auteur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the dome’s hush thickens, moonlight narrows, and the stick’s meaning shifts from prop to bridge; the final image—“silence was invitation”—repackages the stake and carries conceptual cost (he forfeits performer status). Orientation is clean by line 3; one causal micro-turn (he pockets the stick) lands in the last paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Steel ribs,” “fractured aperture,” and gravel underfoot are tactile; the dome’s acoustic history (cold-war listening) mirrors Elias’s new receptivity, so the setting constrains his choice to surrender voice. Weather is minimal, but moonlight as spotlight is enough for this single-scene window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who owns narrative power—tightens once: from puppet auteur to humble scribe; cost is conceptual (loss of curated moral authority) rather than visceral, but legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational: the emptied dome enforces listening. Escalation is modest yet sufficient for 700 words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ethic of reciprocal storytelling emerges through the stick’s redefinition and the bar’s impending conversion into sanctuary; no moral is preached. The meteor-hush motif recurs with shifting weight, culminating in “invitation,” reconfiguring silence from accusation to aperture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—ink, wood grain, echo—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then tightens when he pockets the stick, mirroring resolve; diction (“urbane,” “illuminated script”) matches a calligrapher’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and metaphoric control, but occasional purple lift (“meteor hush,” “cosmic”) and two paraphrase loops (“uncommon serenity” echoed) keep it from 8.5. Otherwise clean: no scaffolding, verbs stay strong, paragraph cuts are taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The puppet-to-scribe reversal of storytelling ethics feels fresh because it internalizes the critique (Lena’s accusation) and weaponizes calligraphy—an unlikely insurgent tool—against erasure. Risk is moderate; payoff is the bar transformed into scriptorium.</comment>
