<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—clinging to a geography-bound vow while sensing its futility—plays out in tactile micro-choices (thumb on needle, soft click to the mare). The endurance he chooses costs the fantasy of returning to Gloom Hill, felt in the final ferry step. Earned, character-particular, no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the dripping-eaves metronome tightens pattern until silence triggers conceptual repricing—promise = love, not place. Causality holds via mnemonic object and drip cadence; closure lands with visible renunciation (no need to turn back). Cost crystallizes when fog lifts and ferry waits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ferry, fog, and yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains attention and finally reframes the vow. River mist governs sensory hierarchy; each drip anchors present reflection. Final image of sun-gilt path is charged by prior atmospheric pressure. Specific, lived-in, no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the “light” promise—tightens once: realization that light is portable, not valley-bound. Agency is attentional endurance; cost is surrendering the dream of geographic redemption. One meaningful deepening satisfies length; no external antagonist needed under accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through palimpsest image: overwritten grief layers lift to reveal love’s transferable essence. Final silence reweights prior drips without moralizing. Subtext in ferryman’s wordless nod confirms communal recognition. Resonant, non-literal answer earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains coachman’s perceptual signature—weathered hands, drip count, scent of river mist. Rhythm slows to match contemplative beats, accelerates at “soft click.” No head-hop; free indirect clean. Diction stays within plausible rural lexicon minus one near-purple “spindrift serenity,” quickly forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths, high density (needle-as-mending symbol performs double duty). A few adjective clusters (“crystalline plink,” “soot-choked valley”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or final image. Zero loops, clean grammar, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar grief-to-acceptance arc made specific through ferry-crossing palimpsest and drip metronome. Yarn needle repurposed as internal compass freshens the trope. Risk is lyric stillness over plot reversals, but pattern teaches early and pays off. Not ground-breaking, yet memorable in execution.</comment>
