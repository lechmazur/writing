<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lived-in and embodied: the scars tighten in cold, the porcelain is “cradled with reverence,” the box becomes a compass-not-anchor. Contradictory impulses (protect fragility vs. share pain) coil through every micro-choice until the final stance crystallizes. No stock phrases; even the metaphor of “hard softness” is earned through tactile granite vs. moonlight. Closure cost is unmistakable: he forecloses the option to keep innocence locked away and accepts the public vocation of “keeper of embers.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the porcelain and scars thickens pattern until the final re-pricing (“the crack was not a flaw, but a story”). Orientation anchored by 28 words; no teleporting props; celestial clock tracks silently but inexorably. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bargain’s meaning flips from “preserve” to “witness,” with persistent social cost—he must now speak the language of scars publicly. Cost is legible in the final image: shadow cast “long ahead” signals irreversible path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and cracked box function as micro-setting: granite underfoot constrains quiet steps, moonlight softens stone and mirrors scarred grace, box weight shifts from anchor to compass. Sensory triage—cool air, scent of damp earth, starlight on porcelain—filters through fire-honed priorities. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props. Environment evolves: moon dips, breeze rises, promising regrowth, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“translate pain into universal language”—is signaled early and tightened through each re-examination of scars/box. One meaningful escalation: realization that innocence is not lost but transformed forces the decision to carry the translation outward. Cost is visible: private grief becomes public vocation, foreclosing anonymity. No external reversals needed; internal deepening under accretive lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: porcelain fracture pattern = survival map; celestial dance = patient healing rhythm. No explicit moral; final image of shadow-as-guide offers non-literal answer to “what is bargained innocence?” Subtext carried in gesture—closing hands around fractures “not to hide but to honor.” Resonance lingers through ambiguity: others’ cracked boxes await, implying communal yet unfinished repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is firefighter-specific—heat endured, weight of helmet, soot-smudged drawing. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for contemplation, clipped noun phrases under pressure (“He rose. The box secure.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “syntax of scars” feels earned, not academic intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence. Information density high—single sentences perform sensory, metaphorical, and causal work (“porcelain’s cracks…map of survival”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language peaks at closure but remains coherent: “fractures gleaming like starlight” fuses box, sky, and scars in one image. Copy-clean; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter trauma translated through cracked porcelain motif rather than standard PTSD tableau. Celestial clock as healing engine avoids therapy-speak cliché. Risk taken with accumulative/lyric structure pays off in Charged Poise ending. Slight dip from slight over-familiarity of “shadow long ahead” as path metaphor, but overall angle feels non-obvious and specific to this voice.</comment>
