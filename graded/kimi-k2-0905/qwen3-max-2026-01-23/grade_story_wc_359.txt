<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—aching to prove “awe as vital as air” while fearing the ritual might fail—stays embodied in trembling grip, frozen tears, the synesthetic overload that forces her to shut her eyes. Micro-choices (mallet delay, breath sync with aurora, the final white strike) map a clear value hierarchy. Cost is certified: exhaustion, tear-cicles, the cavern’s irreversible hum. Could edge higher if an earlier flaw or physical price limited her strikes instead of pure spiritual certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared in first paragraph (“sculpted hush”) and sustained: each bell strike layers density until the silence is reborn warm. Closure is Charged Poise—final white note melts, reconfiguring silence to “fertile vessel.” Cost legible in changed environment and her bodily fatigue. One minor loop: the sculptor’s-chisel synchronicity is elegant but abstract, never felt as constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as micro-setting: pressure for synesthetic translation, tool for resonance, mirror for internal stillness. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she notices color-as-sound, ignores mundane cold. Spatial choreography clean: mallet, bell, sheet, boots tracked. Final image recharged by earlier “sculpted hush,” now singing. Reaches 9 gate only if the chisel-moment had physically altered acoustics on-page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certify wonder—tightened through each chromatic strike that risks shattering the hush forever. Agency is pure: every ringing act deepens stakes; no coincidence. Escalation legible as layered resonance; cost visible in aurora-echoing fatigue. Would enter 8.8 band with a moment where failure felt imminent and costly (crack in bell, fracture in ice).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cumulative image: color → sound → memory release → reborn silence equals necessity of awe. No explicit moral; final warm hum reweights opening “sculpted hush.” Complexity intact—ritual success does not convert skeptics off-page, only vindicates her. Slight echo of “certify wonder” phrase edges toward thematic statement but is earned by ordeal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains synesthetic perceptual signature: “emerald ribbons as ascending scales,” “silent white convergence.” Rhythm controlled—long breaths for stillness, staccato fragments at strikes. No head-hop; compression taught early (“sculpted hush”) paid off. Tiny register lift in “conceptual repricing” could be re-phrased in her idiom, but remains within persuasive lyric ambit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances layer or resonance. Figurative language is disciplined, pattern-taught, peaks at climax without clutter. No loops, filter stacks, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated noun pairing (“crystalline cerulean shard”) flirts with purple but serves auroral scale. Closure beat crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of synesthesia + aurora-driven bell ringing feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “fossilized amber sheet,” “sculpted hush” prevent trope drift. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure succeeds, reconfiguring silence itself. Fresh inflection holds without gimmickry.</comment>
