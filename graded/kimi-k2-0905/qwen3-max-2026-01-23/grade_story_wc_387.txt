<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher’s knot-tying and whistle are embodied micro-choices that externalize his interior arc; the “demure audacity” stance is credibly maintained and paid for in the final image. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the through-line of attention-as-mending is specific and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mended net on his shoulder reframes earlier labor as constellatory, costing him the privacy of his philosophy—now literally carried into the world. The textural lens holds from the first petrichor sentence to the moon-path exit; no causality gaps or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering parapet, mossy joints, and firefly reflections on obsidian water are filtered through the philosopher’s artisanal attention, constraining his decision to whistle and later to leave. The bamboo whisk serves as micro-setting that charges the final image when it rests “a quiet promise” against his hip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are the philosopher’s need to verify that hidden effort matters; the helix of fireflies after his whistle tightens the stake by publicly validating his creed, foreclosing solitary spectatorship. Cost is legible: he must shoulder the repaired net—and its stories—back into human commerce.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: knot, whisk, firefly light. The closing image of “appreciation itself is a form of mending” reweights all prior patterns without moralizing, achieving CR resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric accumulative voice sustains patterned cadence—“hidden effort,” “demure audacity,” “moon paths”—teaching the reader early and paying off in the final benediction. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature remains the philosopher’s artisanal gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long petrichor breaths to the short pulse of “pulsetwice.” One paraphrase loop (“hidden effort…hidden patterns”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesizing net-mending, tea ceremony, and firefly navigation into a single cosmology feels fresh yet inevitable; the risk of lyric repetition is transformed into structural cohesion rather than ornament.</comment>
