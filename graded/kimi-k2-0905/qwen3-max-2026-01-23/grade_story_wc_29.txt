<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. sacrificial guardianship—drives every micro-choice: bypassing the filter, steadying the gain, accepting tears. Hope is embodied, not labeled, and the final smile costs him his job security, a price legible on the last page. No stock phrasing; even “celestial mathematics” is filtered through his technician’s gaze. TheEarned Stasis is fully motivated: he forecloses retreat and accepts retaliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: charts → alignment → modulator → broadcast → waveform softening → quad cooling. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the jagged scar dissolving into neutral static reweights the entire premise that “sub-audible war” is unwinnable. Cost is visible: Dean’s footsteps, Aris’s tear-tracked grime. Orientation anchored by word 38; no ambiguity at lens switch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oscilloscope’s green glow and sub-audible thrum function as micro-setting, constraining every action; the transmitter’s hum replaces weather. Astronomical charts evolve from wall dressing to tactical map to promise-kept icon under the console light. Spatial choreography is flawless: hand on chart, twist of wire, floorboard vibration. Dust motes and dawn bleed ground the cosmic in the tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“outwit tricksters with resonance”—tightens when Croft’s memo forecloses legal broadcast, forcing the illegal hijack. The waveform’s visible softening is the decisive reversal; it narrows options by proving interference works, inviting retaliation. Cost is immediate: Dean’s approaching footsteps. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no abstract inflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pulse of an unseen frequency: compassion as precise technology. The closing image—“mapping light against the void”—reweights earlier charts from academic relic to moral compass without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: lowering the protest sign, accepting the water bottle. Ethereal grit refuses tidy binaries; the community breathes but is not healed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through radio-static diction—“whisper from the void,” “jagged scar of malice.” Rhythm modulates: long clauses for cosmic awe, fragments for hijack moment. No head-hopping; diction stays within Aris’s technical lexicon. Compression—“the shouting faltered”—is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: scar→static, drought→conversation bloom. Information density high: “frequency of empathy woven from celestial mathematics” does triple duty (method, stakes, theme). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during hijack, then exhales at dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-trickster discord sown via infrasound is fresh; the quasar counter-frequency feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—hijacking a campus station under academic purge—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Detail specificity (soldered salvaged parts, ink-stained charts) prevents template drift. Could edge higher if retaliation beyond footsteps were dramatized.</comment>
