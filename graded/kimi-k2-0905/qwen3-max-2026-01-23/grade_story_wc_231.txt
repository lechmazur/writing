<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—his need to decode vs. his creed of non-interference—drives every beat; the micro-choice to press the flower into the log crystallizes his arc with visible cost (loss of pristine solitude). Embodied emotion is precise: “tears welled, not of sorrow, but kinship.” No head-count issues; borrowed-memory backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters stance. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and forecloses investigative chase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam’s cyclical sweep reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—keeper now bound to carry strangers’ memories. Causal linkage holds: because he decodes gaps, therefore he must archive the Edelweiss, therefore his vigil acquires new weight. Orientation anchored by word 28; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (perpetual witness) shapes final image and tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Opal dock and lantern room are filtered through keeper’s professional gaze; mist constrains sound and movement, forcing inward attention. Micro-setting object—logbook—actively guides the final choice. Sensory economy is purposeful; twilight narrows visual field to violet/silver bruise, mirroring internal bruise of isolation. No spatial drift; weather affects pacing rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode gesture vs. preserve solitude—tightens when the alpine flower’s foreignness forces Silas to confront his own coastal exile. One meaningful deepening: recognition that token is preserved relic, not fresh farewell, narrows options from interpretation to witness. Cost is legible: he forfeits detachment by archiving the memory. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, fitting situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from gaps and absences; no overt thesis stated. Final image of sweeping beam reweights earlier tokens as shared tapestry of humanity. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue—and in the flower’s shift from private burden to public witness. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: “heart fuller” yet duty heavier. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers about whether release was mercy or surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, maritime, quietly cadenced; compression taught early (“seamless bruise of violet and silver”). Perceptual signature distinct: keeper notices lapse of waves, star-shaped petals “color of forgotten bone.” No head-hop; interiority clean. Register stays within keeper’s plausible lexicon; lyric elevation is justified by twilight awe. Final whispered farewell modulates distance without breakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; sentences advance triple duty (image, interior, stakes). Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent staircase motion. Metaphors organic: “tapestry of shared humanity” grows from literal cloth of logbook. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “beam swept on” as promise and burden.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: lighthouse as archive of unwitnessed grief, keeper as curator of absences rather than savior. Alpine Edelweiss on coastal dock is non-obvious synthesis; mountain memory transplanted to sea-margin exile. Risk of lyric quietude pays off—closure image reconfigures without spectacle. Transformation test passed: story fails if dock setting or flower swapped. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
