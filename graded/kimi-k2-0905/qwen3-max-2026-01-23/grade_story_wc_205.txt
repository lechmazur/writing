<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled devotion is palpable; her embodied micro-choices (covering mirrors, adjusting velvet) dramatize Kaelen’s ideals under pressure. The interior contradiction—academic duty vs. sacred love—drives every beat. Only the late arrival of Valerius keeps relationship-as-crucible from full ignition, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm → mirror ritual → shard revelation → Council reversal, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: decades of violent assumption collapse under visible chroniton evidence, cost etched in Valerius’s tears and Elara’s “too late” ache. No teleporting props; velvet’s texture as projection screen is seeded early. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid, Hall of Echoing Time, and velvet-draped mirrors are not scenery but tools: mirror cloths become the very screen that forces consensus. Chroniton rivers and cherub reliefs constrain tactics—covering mirrors prevents psychic fracture. Final image of shard on obsidian pedestal is micro-setting that reweights history. Environment charges closure; 9+ gate cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><grade>Stakes—redeem Kaelen’s revolution or cement warlike myth—are signaled in paragraph three. Mid-scene tightening: storm makes reflection lethal, forcing mirror-covering that enables the only path to proof. Cost is legible: Valerius weeps, Elara feels “burnished sorrow… too late.” One decisive intensification satisfies short-form escalation under causal lens.</grade>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as compassionate reconstruction versus weaponized history—emerges through shard’s re-illumination, never sermonized. Subtext in Valerius’s silent spectacles-removal out-argues any manifesto. Final image of “sorrowful, sacred light” reweights prior baroque ornament into reverence. No thematic echo; resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person adheres to Elara’s poet-scholar perceptual filter; velvet’s “slow-drifting amber” is her diction, not authorial flourish. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under storm pressure into clipped imperative beats. Distinctive syntax—spiraling volutes, burnished ache—survives peak stress. One hairline slip: “crystal began to glow” drifts toward generic wonder, holding below 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from stately cumulative clauses to urgent fragments; no template cadence. Figurative layering (“time’s reflection becomes a liar”) is patterned early and paid off when mirrors are covered. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, reveals lore, and escalates stakes. Minor paraphrase loop—“burnished sorrow” appears twice—caps at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusing baroque art-object with hard-SF chroniton science is fresh synthesis; no genre template matches. Ritual vase-shattering as memory-release reconfigures familiar “ancient war” trope into anti-violence poetics. Risk of sentient asteroid grief earns +0.4 bonus when closure transfigures cherubs’ “frozen grief” into relief. Specificity makes premise inseparable from this text.</comment>
