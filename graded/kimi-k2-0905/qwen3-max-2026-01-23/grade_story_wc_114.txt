<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven search is embodied in every beat; the tear darkening the smudge makes remorse tactile. Her shift from oracle-certainty to margin-trusting witness is credibly costly. Interiority stays concrete—”cold, dense stone of remorse” not therapy labels. Only the twenty-year backstory capsule feels told, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: palm on glass, whispered promise, aurora overhead—cost is felt, path foreclosed. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (drip, needle tremor, smudge bloom) tightens the stake until the final image reweights “truth.” No causality breaks; Kael’s earlier warning seeds the guilt that the smudge forces her to swallow. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost-rimed anemometers, barometer needle, and the logbook itself act as micro-setting that constrains her gaze and finally her stance. Weather-station details are filtered through post-fever perception—”ghost-scent of pine resin and old paper”—never tourist catalog. The aurora’s color-river charges the closing image, reconfiguring sorrow into witness. Mountain cold is felt in the glass under her palm, anchoring body-in-space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the buried guilt—tightens when the smudge reveals the hidden bud, forcing acknowledgment. One meaningful deepening suffices: pride swallowed the warning, now humility must occupy the margin. Cost is legible in the tear that darkens the page and the whispered vow that ends her predictive certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates under accrual of sensory evidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth roots in the unseen—emerges through the smudge’s transformation, never stated outright. Final aurora reframes earlier perfectionism as fragile denial, offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. The Glacier Lily illustration moves from symbol of flawless record to map of resilient imperfection, carrying thematic weight. One hairline slip: “Truth roots in the unseen” is underlined in text, slightly echoing prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s post-fever perception; no head-hop. Diction—”crystalline air,” “sepia ink blurred the lower margin”—is precise yet lyrical, matching an oracle trained to notice minutiae. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fever-drift, staccato for tear-drop moment. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature alone, which remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—”Sunlight glinted off frost-rimed anemometers, their steady whirring a fragile counterpoint”—advancing atmosphere and stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image is fresh. One mixed metaphor—”swaying certainties where bedrock conviction once stood”—but it resolves through context. Final paragraph breathes with short declaratives after layered clauses, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteorological precision with botanical marginalia feels fresh; the smudge-as-lesson reverses the trope of flawless data. Post-fever perception as narrative filter justifies lyric compression without gimmick. Risk lies in quiet ending—no storm rescue or confrontation—but the auroral image reweights prior material memorably. Could edge higher if Kael’s voice had left an even subtler fragment than the underlined phrase.</comment>
