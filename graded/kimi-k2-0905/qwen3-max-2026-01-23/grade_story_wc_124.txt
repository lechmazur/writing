<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—professional control of light vs. terror of scent-triggered memory—drives every beat; the micro-choice to uncork the vial under UV is earned. Embodied grief is visceral (“tears… scattering crystalline shadows”). The vial’s revealed inscription reweights her vocation, but the pivot from “wistful broker” to “story-broker” is declared more than dramatized; a sharper visible cost (e.g., a client she’ll lose) would clinch 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: UV lamps dim, tears still fall, she presses the vial to her heart—an image that reconfigures vocation and grief simultaneously. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light/revelation taught early (“fractured moonlight… crystal shadows”) culminates in ultraviolet cathedral. Causality intact: because she is aromatically cautious, the single drop matters; because the vial was pre-loaded by Gran, inscription glows. Cost is felt—no forced reset—earns 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost conservatory body-memory and greenhouse UV lattice are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered. The “rough teak bench” and “fractured moonlight” anchor body and glass as micro-settings that later charge the closure. Extinct flora rules stay consistent; no exposition dump. Environment does not physically constrain tactics enough to reach 9.0—would need one beat where a plant’s poison or thorn exacts a visible price.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why smells undo her—tightens when the UV ritual forces the test; escalation is density-driven (UV veins, scent memory avalanche). Agency visible: she uncorks despite caution, then reframes vocation. Cost is emotional tears and the acknowledged permanence of ache; could edge 9-band if a tangible external loss (e.g., shattered lantern, ruined sale) were paired to the tear baptism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: memory as light that needs shadow to be visible. Subtext works through recurring crystal imagery (glass, vial, tears) refracting meaning. Final image reframes “lantern broker” as keeper of both light and shadow; avoids tidy uplift yet lands resonance. −0.1 for single thematic echo (“light needs shadow to be seen”) that edges toward explicit; still within high band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is wistful, synesthetic, lantern-broker particular: “captured starlight… gentle luminescence of forgotten dawns.” Rhythm swells and contracts with UV reveal and olfactory dissolution; compression during memory flood suits lyrical mode. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction stays within lexicon of artisan-sensualist; occasional elevated flourish (“cathedral of revealed beauty”) is earned by prior pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “silver veins—a forgotten language of pollination” does triple duty. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence runs. One mixed metaphor pair (“whispered secret… world dissolved”) but does not obscure closure. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy preserved through sensory anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lantern broker + scent-memory + UV-reveal extinct flora is non-obvious. Ghost Orchid perfume as grandmother time-capsule feels inevitable in hindsight yet new. Risk in lyric memory flood is paid off by thematic clarity. Avoids steampunk clichés; specificity (“brass fittings, delicate chimneys, wicks of spun moonbeam”) grounds concept.</comment>
