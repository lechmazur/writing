<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich (“hands stained with oil and patience”) and her micro-choice to surrender force at the climax is earned. Missing: a second on-page character to pressure status/relationship dynamics; flaw (control) stated but not allowed to compound into visible mistake before cavern. Still, the river-stone keepsake gives her a tactile, idiosyncratic signature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle renounces north, reweighting the entire premise of fixed direction. Accumulative lens holds: leaf-pattern, latch, waterfall mist each return charged. Cost is palpable—she gives up certainty and gains a current. Minor drag: soot-note arrival is slightly teleported; no causal bridge from admiral’s grief to locket clue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse decay, obsidian pool, and basalt shelf are vivid, selective, filtered through Elara’s tinkerer eye. The waterfall mist as tool-constraint at climax is a perfect micro-setting charge. Spatial track is clean; no orientation debt. Could use one non-visual sense earlier to widen bandwidth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover compass vs. need for control—tightens once when she chooses surrender over force. Escalation is textural: each leaf swirl, metal latch, mist drop accumulates pressure. Agency is present but externalized; waterfall “gives” direction rather than her action creating new option. Cost is conceptual, felt, yet not a forfeiture that alters later tactics on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely through leaf, grit, waterfall—direction as surrender, not mastery. No overt thesis; final image reweights “map” without moralizing. Subtext in the seized needle offers quiet irony. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual field; diction stays within tinkerer lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short clauses during leaf battle, longer cadence under waterfall. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Filter verbs minimal; only “she felt” once, justified by epistemic shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: “oil and patience” compresses vocation and weariness in three words. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chains are sparse and coherent. Final line swaps “tick” for “rhythm” to recharge opening clock motif. One mixed image—“roar and quiet courage”—but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar quest arc refreshed by underground greenhouse-to-waterfall reveal and compass that abandons north. Risk is moderate; structure stays safe. Specificity of leaf-propelled latch and mist-as-tool elevates above template. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not startlingly new.</comment>
