<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the ache for lost joy is palpable in every micro-choice (calibrating the lens “with reverent hands,” pressing the fragment into the crease). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she never hesitates or risks failure—so the final integration feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. Still, the visible cost (tears, the fragment left behind) locks the change to her body, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the projected fresco completes and the fragment is fixed in wall and heart, reweighting both memory and future art. Causality is lyric-accumulative (fog = film) rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is felt in the crystalline moment of integration, not a physical loss, satisfying the CR test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fog is not backdrop but photosensitive emulsion; every droplet constrains how light can “develop” memory, directly enabling the climax. Pearlescent gravel, stone-sparrow archway, moss-eaten bench are selected, not catalogued, and filter through Elara’s artist-eye. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting when its ceramic edge aligns with its luminous twin, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the recovery of lost joy—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the fresco blooms, foreclosing the option of permanent loss. No external antagonist or reversal is needed; pressure is the fading beam and dissolving fog that force the moment of integration. Cost is the recognition that joy exists only in honoring impermanence, paid in quiet tears. Agency is pure attention and display, sufficient under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of permanence-through-ephemera: light fixes what stone cannot. The refrain of “development” migrates from photography to soul without authorial nudging. Final image—the ceramic apple nested in its living projection—offers a non-literal answer: memory stays only if released. No moral is stated; the aftereffect is a hush of gratitude rather than instruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly-photographic: syntax slows to aperture clicks (“Slowly, like magic in a darkroom tray…”) then widens to fresco sweeps. Diction stays within Elara’s lexicon of light, pigment, latent image. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm breathes with the projector’s hum and the fog’s dissolve, modulating under peak wonder without monotony.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, motion—without scaffold: “the moisture-laden fog acted precisely as exposed film” collapses world-rule, stakes, and tactic into one clause. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density peaks at the bloom but is justified by the taught pattern. Final paragraph trims to cadenced fade, leaving a clean ember of rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “fog as film” conceit re-enchants ruin-porn terrain; the knowledge-network of tea-time whispers is a fresh social synapse rather than dusty archives. Risk is lyric stillness in place of plot reversals, but it pays off in resonant reconfiguration. Specificity of ceramic fragment aligning with projected apple makes the metaphor irreplaceable. Feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed.</comment>
