<comment>Elias’s reticence and observant nature are shown through tactile micro-choices (dismantling the stack, selecting stones) that externalize inner stakes; the “bottle safety” motive is dramatized in the final stacking act with visible cost (the ache). Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of deepest grief is slightly abstracted (“luminescent ache blending sorrow…”) rather than embodied in contradictory impulse, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Phoenix Stack reconfigures the legacy and forecloses Elias’s retreat from guardianship; cost is legible in the “luminescent ache” he now carries. Causal chain is tight—extinguished lamp → need for signal → stack as message → successor will read it—held under a single continuous scene. No orientation or lens ambiguity; every beat advances the stakes.</comment>

<comment>Lantern room functions as micro-setting: the cold teacup, dust motes, and moon-split Fresnel lens constrain attention and later charge the final image when the sea glass refracts that same moonlight onto the new stack. Spatial choreography is immaculate; weather (fog) presses against the glass and motivates the urgency. One notch below 9 only because the cliffside pines are named but not leveraged inside this scene’s action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the wordless chain alive—tightens once: from passive discovery of the dark lamp to active creation of the Phoenix Stack. The stacking act is an irreversible tactical choice that narrows Elias’s future to perpetual guardian; price is the physical ache and the emotional burden he now bottles. Escalation is accumulative: each placed stone increases density of obligation until the cobalt shard ignites the meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—care outlives absence—emerges entirely through image and gesture; no explicit thesis. The sea glass, once a token of reassurance, is repurposed as Elias’s vow, reweighting the object’s meaning at closure. Final image offers resonant, non-moral answer: hope sleeps but persists. Subtext in the silent stone language carries the emotional after-effect without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—measured, maritime, tactile. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses as stones click into place, mirroring rising resolve. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; diction remains within a skipper’s lexicon. One minor filter verb cluster (“he remembered… he remembered…”) is voice-motivated and paid off, not artifactual.</comment>

<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“nestled,” “ignited”), no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—moonlight “fracturing into spectral rainbows” charges the lens for the later sea-glass glow. One mixed metaphor (“bottle the feeling… in this fragile architecture”) is allowed because the conceptual CR lands cleanly. Clean copy, zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The stone-code message system feels fresh, rooted in maritime practicality and grief ritual; the Phoenix Stack is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse duty and wordless inheritance. Cobalt sea glass transformed from comfort to covenant offers a reconfiguring turn that grows organically from earlier particulars. Risk is quiet rather than flashy, but coherence and specificity make the concept memorable.</comment>
