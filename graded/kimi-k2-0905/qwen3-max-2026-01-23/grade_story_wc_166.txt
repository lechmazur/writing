<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to protect ocean memory while binding herself to land—grounds every micro-choice; the final release of her “spontaneous anchor” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Kael’s understated trust and bodily awe render him more than vessel, though his lack of prior stakes keeps the dyad just shy of crucible intensity. The moonstone’s vanishing literalizes the price on the page, satisfying the 9+ test, yet the beat remains singular; no secondary flaw touches closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard layers sensory density until the final “obsidian grace” reweights exile from burden to chosen flight. The moonstone-dew fusion is the decisive change; starlight sinks into skin, foreclosing Elara’s retreat and charging Kael’s departure with cosmic cost. Orientation is taught early via twilight garden & tide-dancer title; pattern holds without causal gaps. Closure is on-page, felt, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Garden, body, and moonstone function as micro-setting: thorn-scraped dew, wrist-pulse shadow, and Altair-gap sightline all constrain the inscription ritual. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of wind-song, cool starlight on skin—keeps pressure tight. Final image of moonstone vanished into destiny charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate. No spatial drift or white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a verse that defeats the nostalgia ban—tightens once: the moment moonstone flares, Elara’s exile forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: relic dissolves, anchor releases. Agency is accumulative: each gap-observation adds density until the single decisive act. Under lyric lens, escalation is legible as cadence shift, not reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concretely sequenced images—shattered amphitheater, dewdrop cosmos, wrist void—never abstract assertion. Final “obsidian grace” reprises opening canopy, reconfiguring exile as authorship of dawn. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic. The nostalgia ban’s erasure is conceptually repriced: memory can live in skin, not archives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric hovers at dancer’s perceptual distance: tidal breath, star-gap calibrations, volcanic-glass gesture. Syntax mirrors wave-gather rhythm; diction stays within coastal poet lexicon. No head-hop; Kael’s awe is externally registered yet filtered through Elara’s tide-sense. Final “obsidian grace” line modulates tone to crystalline release, paying off taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control heightens without clog: varying sentence length mimics surf-draw; no template cadence detected. Figurative vehicles (volcanic glass, dew-mirror) are sparse, coherent, and paid off. Information-dense lines (“luminous map of courage”) compress backstory without scaffold. Minor near-repeat of “grace” twice could shave 0.1, but closure line justifies echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing tide-dance, star-gap cartography, and skin-ink into a single ritual feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk: lyric elision could have broken causality; instead it tightens accumulative pressure. Nostalgia ban as off-stage bureaucratic villain sidesteps cliché; resistance is intimate, not revolutionary. Transformation test fails if relocated—this verse needs oceanic exile and lunar dust.</comment>
