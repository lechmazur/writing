<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia, brooch-totem, and painterly lens are tightly braided; every beat filters through his exhausted perception and the amber weight on his cuff. The renunciation of the brooch lands as earned cost because seventeen years of vigilant sleeplessness have inscribed the object with survivor’s guilt. Interiority stays concrete—“salt and fear as waves rose” bodies emotion without label-speak. Only the moment he “understood his insomnia was not a curse” flirts with self-diagnosis, blunting full 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: handing over the brooch reweights the premise—memory is a current, guardianship temporary. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; rain-trail imagery and tide rhythm tighten until the final sleep invitation feels inevitable. Cost is visible in the physical surrender of the amber and the instantaneous exhaustion that follows. One transition (tower→ravine→tower) is clean, taught by the pilgrim impulse.</comment>

<comment>The tidal island is not backdrop; its breathing timetable dictates when Elias can move and when memory surfaces. Heartstone pressed into his palm and tide “flooding the mudflats with rhythmic certainty” are final-image setting details that charge the closure with geological permanence. Sensory selection is painter-biased—pigment grit, rain-glisten veins—so environment filters through vocation. Micro-setting (brooch, heartstone) satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning or drown in remembrance—tightens when the rain trails literalize the urge. One meaningful deepening: brooch shifts from private talisman to inherited debt, foreclosing the option to keep it. Escalation is textural under Accumulative lens; each remembered fragment layers weight until surrender is the only relief. Cost is legible in the tear Elara sheds and the “profound exhaustion” that finally claims him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as custodianship versus release; no character lectures us. Final reconfiguration—insomnia re-priced as vigil, sleep now earned—lands without moral tag. The beetle trapped in amber quietly argues memory must be freed, a conceptual re-pricing shown, not stated. Subtext in Elara’s single tear carries generations of unspoken gratitude and grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly synesthesia: “consciousness a perpetual canvas,” “rain trails—silver threads weaving sky to earth.” Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, mirroring tide and fatigue. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays in Elias’s haggard aesthetic. Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing,” “sacrament of continuity”—barely protrudes above the lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; clauses layer like glazes without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided; rain-veins remain vascular, never stray to circuitry. One scaffold risk—“wryly earnest” repeated four times—verges on template but serves as motif-tag. Closure sentence “dreamed of rain trails leading not away, but home” is clean, resonant, unburdened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post–water-war coastlines are familiar terrain, yet the rain-trail pilgrimage, beetle-amber lineage, and heartstone exchange create a specific mythos. Tropes of climate grief and insomnia are refreshed through painterly synesthesia and geological memory. Final inversion—staying awake was the heroic act, sleeping the sacrament—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off because closure remains legible.</comment>
