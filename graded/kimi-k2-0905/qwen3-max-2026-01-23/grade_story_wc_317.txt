<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—“innovation vs. investor impracticality”—is crisp; the seed prompts one visible micro-choice (burying unmarked) that seals his stance. Emotion stays embodied (seed turning in palm, breath-held hush). Cost is present but abstract; no tangible drawback forecloses a path, so renunciation reads mild.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers patience imagery toward the quiet climax. Anchors who/where arrive by line 4; orientation clean. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—his “private covenant” reweights earlier investor rejection with felt artistic cost. Persistent constraint (no marker, seven-year wait) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Brook, rain-washed stones, mossy bench filter through Elias’s puzzle-designer eye; sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Micro-setting (seed, soil, brook rhythm) constrains the closing choice to plant unmarked. Weather’s “storm-born silence” mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean across kneel/bury/return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect slow innovation—tightens when investors’ “impractical” label is recalled; seed forces a live test of that creed. One meaningful deepening: daily soil visits convert abstract patience into ritual. Price is opportunity/time but stays conceptual; no external obstacle complicates after planting. Sufficient escalation for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—“breakthroughs emerge through attentive care, not force”—emerges via seed ritual rather than assertion. Final image of “possibility just born” reweights earlier dismissal of “The Patient Bloom” without moralizing. Some near-thesis phrasing (“heart of true innovation”) slightly over-articulates, but subtext predominates in unmarked burial. Ambiguity about future bloom sustains resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature: puzzle-designer lexicon (“orthogonal approaches,” “ticking timers”) colors every observation. Rhythm modulates from meditative long sentences to staccato sketching at end, mirroring creative surge. No head-hopping; psychic distance tight to Elias. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers external action, metaphor, and interior tilt (“seed…promise of rare beauty and infamous decay”). Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph cuts are lean. One mixed metaphor cluster (“liquid metaphor for creativity’s persistent, unseen current”) slightly dilutes peak beat but does not obscure closure. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Escape-room proprietor receives corpse-flower seed via anonymous mail—fresh synthesis of niche occupation and botanical rarity. Orthogonal-thinking motif transforms standard “follow your vision” arc into puzzle-design credo. Investors vs. seed conflict particularizes theme; not easily relocated. Risks quietness over plot fireworks, coherent with stance.</comment>
