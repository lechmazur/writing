<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, the scar on her wrist—yet the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices; the final carving decision feels pre-ordained rather than wrested under fresh pressure, capping the score just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the steam-filled Barcelona cup reweights the ash blank into a seed for tomorrow’s lesson, with visible cost—“bitterness balanced by honey” shows integration of loss; lens holds Accumulative/Textural as each curl of wood thickens the pattern without causal reversals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight, walnut ink, cherry pipe ghosts—details are filtered through Elara’s trained chiseler eye; the carving blank itself becomes micro-setting that constrains every cut, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Ash texture, kettle whistle, and rust-hued palette evolve with the emotional cadence, no setting drift detected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“contain grief without surrender”—is signaled early; escalation is accretive: each shaving removes avoidance and narrows tomorrow’s options. No causal reversal, but the deepening pattern forecloses the option to leave the blank uncarved, with felt cost in the whistle-shattered pause and the deliberate bitterness in her tea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence-as-presence emerges from the curl-by-curl accrual, never name-checked; the steam reprise of “here and gone” reweights earlier raindrops without moralizing. Complexity remains: containment equals respect, not erasure—no tidy consolation, only integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a woodworker’s tactile idiom—“mapped with the fine lines,” “peeled away”—and rhythmic modulation that mirrors chisel pressure; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Free-indirect slips cleanly into “she sought to contain” without authorial intrusion, maintaining perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density—each sentence carves image and motive together; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized time,” “conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but reads as Elara’s artisanal precision, forgiven under voice motivation; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Grief-as-woodcarving is fresh; the lion-tamer widow angle supplies occupational specificity without gimmickry. Risk-taking lies in accretive lyric structure rather than plot twist, yielding inevitable hindsight resonance. Could edge higher with a sharper surprise inflection, but transformation feels authored, not templated.</comment>
