<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—protective erasure vs. archival truth—are dramatized in the meteorite-ledger gesture; the final micro-choice to write the testimonial line costs him his fabricated safety and is causally prepared by the dust-vortex memory trigger. Interiority stays concrete (“grief, sharp as the meteorite’s edge”) and avoids label-speak. Only the off-page Lyra and Clara remain abstracts, capping relationship crucible points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger entry “I trusted her. I trust her still” crystallizes a new stance with unmistakable social/psychic cost—his cover is gone. Causal linkage holds: dust pattern → memory flood → renunciation of lie → public confession. Orientation is anchored by word 90; no lens ambiguity. The single skylight beat teaches the accumulative pattern early and lands it at the end.</comment>

<comment>The attic’s sunbeam, ledger stack, and meteorite chip function as micro-setting that constrains the balance ritual and final testimony; spatial choreography is clean (hand lowers chip onto specific page). Sensory detail is selective—calloused fingertip, yellowed paper, pigeon coo outside—filtered through cartographer’s gaze. Environment never stalls momentum; each object is handled, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving vs. speaking the lost songs—tightens once: the dust vortex forces public confession, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible: the written sentence ends twenty years of erasure. Agency is internal yet decisive; no coincidence resolves anything. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring “paper trails” and “echo” images: memory must be inhabited, not archived. Final image of dust swirling around fresh ink reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of trust as simultaneous bloom/decay is implied, not stated. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—cartographic precision, pigeon-handler vocabulary (“rustle of wings trusting his hands”). Rhythm modulates: long cadences for memory, staccato for the chip-balance beat. No head-hopping or register drift. Metaphor density is taught early (dust motes as historians) and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold phrase—“a desperate attempt to preserve the echo of lost songs”—is redundant but does not touch the final third. Strong verbs (“balanced,” “shattering,” “yielding”) carry motion. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Mars meteorite, pigeon-war backstory, and book-mender anonymity feels idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight. Dust-mote cartography as balance method is a fresh sensory device that reweights meaning at the end. No derivative premise penalties; the synthesis is specific to Elias’s voice and stakes.</comment>
