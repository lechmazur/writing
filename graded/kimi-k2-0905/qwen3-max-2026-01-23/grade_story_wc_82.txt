<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile lantern-work and the paper-fold ritual; contradictory impulses (cling/release) live in the same micro-gestures. The final tear is earned because every crane has compressed visible cost on the page. Voice keeps interiority concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Only cap is the solitary POV—no relational crucible on stage—so the full 9-band “contradictory-impulse-in-scene” gate is narrowly missed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last crane reframes all prior sorrow without erasing it, cost felt in the single tear. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of descent/ascent, polish/fold, gem/light—tightening until the final silver glint reweights the stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift. No causal breaks, no loops; the basilica’s fragility becomes the perfect physicalization of earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool converge: the floating tea garden supplies the fragrant paper that will later absorb the dream; the glass basilica’s fragility mirrors the lantern’s brittle quartz and Elara’s own cracked composure. Space is coherent—waterfall mist, ascending air, dais—every distance tracked. Sensory hierarchy follows her crafter’s eye (silver-leaf, quartz clarity, crease tension). The crane on the sill in final twilight recharges every prior image; only missing a 9+ is the lack of an explicit tactical constraint from setting during the recording beat itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render grief bearable—signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each fold; the silver gem’s flare is the single decisive intensification that forces the trade-off (record pain ≠ erase it). Under Accumulative lens, density of cranes and polished gems reweights the emotional cost until the last bird crystallizes options. No coincidence resolves; ascent of island continues, but her internal descent narrows choices to: fold again or fracture. Price is visceral—every sheet of dream-luminescent paper consumed is one irretrievable shard of night.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refrains of light/reflection/ascent versus shadow/fold/descent; no sentence declares “grief must be transformed,” yet the paper cranes make the argument in origami geometry. The final tear re-prices the shadow not as void but as prior light source—an elegant conceptual flip. Ambiguity lingers: folding is endless, peace is fragile, no moral is preached. Subtext lives in creases, not commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is lantern-maker (she sees “silver-leafed blooms,” hears quartz “hum”). Syntax lengthens during ascent, contracts during fold—rhythmic control mirrors emotional altitude. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Occasionally elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “luminous torment”) barely grazes the POV’s plausible lexicon, just ducking the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Figurative layer is spare but precise—crane “mid-flight,” basilica “woven from light and longing”—never clotted. Varied sentence openings and paragraph breaths create natural cadence. Copy-clean; no mixed metaphors, no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Folding grief into origami lanterns is fresh; dream-capture gem polished by tears fuses material craft with metaphysics without feeling grafted. The ascent/descent paradox is re-imagined as visceral choreography rather than abstract motif. Specificity of silver-leaf tea, void-waterfalls, and paper luminescence prevents trope checklist vibe. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off because closure image is unmistakably charged.</comment>
