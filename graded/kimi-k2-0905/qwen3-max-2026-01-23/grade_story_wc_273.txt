<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kael’s calm-anger contradiction is embodied in tactile micro-choices (fingers on stone, stilling breath) and drives the final renunciation; the “consciously wild” trait, however, is asserted more than dramatized, and the drone-loss backstory is recounted rather than tested in scene, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s disappearance through the ink-pattern reweights the entire quest—time-dilation is perception, not cosmic law—while the wind-erased stone provides visible cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern-density → reconfiguration) is taught early and holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Wind-sculpted sandstone, copper drone, and indigo ink are filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze; each object constrains action (drone’s sensors, ink’s vanishing window) and charges the final image when the stone returns to “utterly clean,” making the micro-setting indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why does time slow?”—tightens when wind funnels ink into eclipse-mirrors; the single deepening (pattern recognition → drone sacrifice) forecloses rebuilding and carries felt cost, satisfying the one-turn requirement for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of vanishing patterns (dust, ink, drone) and ends with the quiet repricing that perception, not physics, stretches crisis-time; no moral is stated—the wind-smoothed stone alone carries the conceptual cost, inviting reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter; wind-polished, star-drinking, “serene anger” diction is consistent and rhythmic, modulating into breath-still quiet at climax; no head-hop or register drift, though occasional elevated phrasing (“cognitive anchors”) edges toward academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propel without scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“patient sculptor,” “whispered magic”) yet never clutters the high-pressure ink-reading beat; one near-loop (“serene anger… serene acceptance”) survives but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines albino tracker, clock-eating eclipse, and sentient drone into a fresh meditation on perceived time; the ink-pattern transit device feels inevitable in hindsight and carries conceptual cost, transforming a familiar “time slows in danger” trope into intimate phenomenology without gimmickry.</comment>
