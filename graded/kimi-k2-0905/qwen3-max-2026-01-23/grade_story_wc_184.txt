<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “translate confusion into clarity” drive is concrete, embodied in the rope-work; her calm methodical stance stays coherent while she performs the only action that matters. No contradictory impulses surface in scene, so the internal-conflict bullet is empty, yet the micro-choice hierarchy (weaving the seal at the exact absent year) is legible and costly in felt time. The −0.2 keeps her out of the 9-band because the story never risks her composure—no visible mistake or emotional slippage under pressure, so the arc is smooth but not complexly human.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal on door → rope re-weave → door vanishes, each step because/therefore. Closure is a clean CR: the “absence” is conceptually repriced as honored memory, amber liquid sinking into stone supplies undeniable cost. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. The 0.1 gap reflects a lone soft beat: the clock halts without foreshadowed linkage to the rope, a micro-convenience that slightly dulls the final constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clock-tower mechanism room is tactile, lived-in, and selectively lit; oil, brass, timber notes arrive through Elara’s archivist eye. Spatial choreography is flawless—she kneels, loosens, weaves, ascends; bodies and rope stay tracked. The rope itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. A hairline slip: sunlight “fractured” is pretty but POV-neutral, not yet filtered through her professional gaze, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“heal the schism or live with a lie in the archive”—is signaled by the anomalous door and tightens when the seal motif is touched. Single meaningful escalation: re-weaving the governance braid forecloses the option to leave the void blank; cost is the audible silence after gears stop. Pressure is coherent under causal lens, though the external world never pushes back; all tension is conceptual, sufficient for this length but not multi-layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring absence emerges solely through braid imagery and the liquid-amber seal; no character sermonizes. Final image—granite wall drinking the seal—reweights the premise: erasure becomes inscription without a moral declared. Complexity is left intact; reader keeps the ache. The slight 0.8 margin allows for one near-label phrase—“clarity emerges from weaving absence into remembrance”—but it is earned by dramatized action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: “dust motes dancing above the ponderous machinery” reads through her calm, methodical awe. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the braid-work (“cool void of omitted threads”). Syntax mirrors temperament—measured cadence, Latinate nouns—yet avoids mechanical monotony. A 0.1 deduction for occasional poetic universalism (“cathedral of measured time”) that momentarily lifts outside her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Figurative control disciplined: only two metaphors in the climax, both tied to POV (liquid memory, watercolor blur). Opening and closing lines are propulsive, framing and recharging the braid motif. Clean grammar, varied sentence lengths, strong verbs—publish-ready line craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Treaty-shaped hole made tangible via rope-archive is fresh; avoids familiar ghost-door tropes by tying disappearance to bibliographic craft. Risk is taken and paid off: the entire resolution hinges on textile historiography, not exorcism. The concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight. A 0.4 gap remains because the university setting is sketched generically—could be any Gothic campus—reducing singular texture.</comment>
