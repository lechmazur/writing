<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and body-anchored (“tears traced warm paths,” “sharp eyes seeing”), her micro-choice to surrender the stone is earned by the footage epiphany, and her flaw (clinging to stasis) complicates the arc. Yet the sole on-page relationship is with the absent shadow, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are moot and the cost, while felt, is lightly dramatized; still, the renunciation visibly forecloses her old role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s internal bloom and Elara’s smile crystallize a before/after stance with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of dusk-viewing, footage comparison, vine-glow shifts—all tightening toward the surrender image. No orientation debt; anchors settle by line 5. One hairline slip: “luminous regret” is named twice; else causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library’s living architecture (breathing shelves, dream-vines) is tactile and filtered through Elara’s curator gaze; spatial choreography is clean as she moves from terrace to archive nook. The river stone acts as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual/thermal) but purposefully so through her trained perception; no world-rule inconsistency. Missing gate: environment does not alter tactics beyond the stone itself—hence 8.6 not 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve hope’s shape”—is signaled early and deepened when footage reveals the shadow as catalyst, forcing Elara toward surrender. One meaningful tightening: the stone warms and blooms, paying visible cost. Shadow-as-complication is external but agency remains hers to release the talisman. Could edge higher if a concrete tactical loss (e.g., forfeited archive key) had been dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope must evolve via erosion/pressure like river stone. The shadow’s paradoxical brightening of dreams and the stone’s revealed veins reprice “constancy” without moralizing. Subtext resides in footage silence and the stone’s secret lattice. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally. Minor thematic echo “shape of hope” recurs; barely beneath 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is curator-precision (“minute tendril curl,” “blossom’s hue held more gold”). Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror footage sift, then short releases at surrender. Diction stays within her lexicon; no head-hopping. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue absent by design—no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, yet readable aloud without strain; sentence variety strong. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrase (“celestial light softened”) fits elevated setting. Information multitasks: “dream-vines cascading…each leaf a whispered memory” sets scene, theme, and stakes in one stroke. Closure image pristine; no artifact touches final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating library of shareable dreams feels fresh, yet grounded by intimate curator rationale. Shadow-as-catalyst reverses corruption trope without late rule change. River-stone payoff is inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail—oval stone, silver veins—prevents generic allegory. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds under Accumulative lens. Not 9+ only because premise still nods to familiar “archive of souls” trope, albeit transformed.</comment>
