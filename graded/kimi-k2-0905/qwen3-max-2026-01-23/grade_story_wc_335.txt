<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s shard-mirror physiology and backward step are more ornament than lived constraint; the moment he “plants his feet” registers, but Elara’s shift from scoff to tracing the spiral is cleanly embodied and motivated. The mentor/student crucible tightens with visible micro-choices (tea pour, quill slide) and ends in shared stance change. Flaw: Kael’s interior contradiction is asserted via memory flash rather than enacted, keeping him just shy of full 3-D pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Elara writes “Return,” the swing outside widens, cost is felt in the widening arc and Kael’s deliberate forward step that forecloses his retreat habit. Causal lattice holds—tea geometry → spiral recognition → annotation → external motion—without leaks. Single-scene orientation is anchored by word 80; no disorientation served, so penalty waived. Lens stays situational-accumulative to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Library air, trapped shadow, and swing silhouette recur with shifting charge; the shadow pane literally sits on the desk, constraining Elara’s gaze and later mirroring her spiral. Sensory triage favors dust, vellum, steam—never tourist list. Micro-setting success: the oak desk surface acts as lab for tea-leaf cartography, directly enabling the climax annotation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reversible exile—signals page 1 and tightens through each beat: annotation attempt, failed first reading, second seeing of spiral, final inscription. One meaningful deepening: chaos → spiral → “Return” narrows options from despair to navigable path. Price is conceptual but legible—Elara’s exile remains, yet its geometry is now map-able, foreclosing pure fatalism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-as-geometry emerges through tea leaves, swing arc, and spiral—not lectured. Final reweighting: absence is no longer erasure but measurable shape, a resonant non-moral. No echo line or thesis states the theme; it crystallizes in the swing’s widening arc and the single annotated word.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Kael’s shoulder with shard-reflective perceptual signature: every visual is fractured, glinting, mirrored. Velvet-sheathed blade diction suits centuries-old mentor; Elara’s sparse, spat “These words are dust” differentiates her voice. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens as Kael leans closer, shards multiplying her doubt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control—from languid twilight clauses to the staccato “Return.”—mirrors emotional arc. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. One mixed metaphor risk: “blade sheathed in velvet” beside “geometry of tea” survives because both fit Kael’s persona. Clean mechanics; fogged facets and ink-drop propulsion maintain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shard-mirror archivist, trapped shadow as map-making tool, and tea-leaf topology synthesize into a fresh resilience parable. Swing-and-spiral recursion feels inevitable in hindsight, not pre-fab. Risk—quiet mentor story—pays off through charged poise closure. Minor deduction for echoing the wise-mentor/resentful-student dyad, even if materials are new.</comment>
