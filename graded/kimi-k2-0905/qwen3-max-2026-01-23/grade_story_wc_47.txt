<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the amber press and whispered renunciation embody contradictory impulses on the page. The only drag is a touch of therapy-speak ("I honor the truth of my regret...") mid-ceremony that momentarily flattens embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the icicle map, pendant burial, and honeyed hush each tighten the same stake—will she release shame?—until the moss circle reweights her stance with undeniable cost. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options foreclosed, price felt, no causal cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment rules every beat: skylight geometry guides her path, moss softness times her kneeling, pendant amber glows against green to charge the final image. One sentence of stage-missing ("chamber’s heart") is forgiven because spatial grammar soon re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she relinquish the viral shame anchored in the pendant?—ratchets through each sensorial beat until the burial forecloses retrieval. Cost is visible (loss of Lena’s gift) and conceptual (public narrative can no longer be edited), meeting the 8+ trade-off bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not pronouncement: fossilized insect / fossilized error, drip reshapes stone / drip of regret reshapes identity. Final image re-weights the premise without moralizing—an earned CR that invites re-reading rather than closure-by-maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction skews lyrical yet remains within a dreamer’s plausible lexicon. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm swells then quiets with breath, supporting the honeyed hush without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; each descriptive stroke also moves her feet or mood. A single mixed metaphor ("green veins of renewal") and two adjective pairs could trim, but no loops or scaffold stall momentum, and cadence mirrors her slowed pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The "data-center-as-moss-garden" conceit is fresh, and the icicle cartography turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-reclamation is trendy—yet specificity of the mayfly fossil and viral confession twist the trope into memorable synthesis.</comment>
