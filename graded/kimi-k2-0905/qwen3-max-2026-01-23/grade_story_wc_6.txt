<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but stays embodied; the graft micro-choice at the lagoon crystallizes her contradictory impulses (heal vs. inherit) with visible cost—the coin/kelp burial. Emotional arcs trace credible irrationality: shame, love, duty collide without tidy resolution. Flaws (arsonist blood) actively complicate the final ritual, satisfying earned stasis. 9+ blocked only because the father’s voice flashback lapses into paraphrased wisdom rather than fresh, specific diction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery density (black sand, red thread, migrating clouds) mounts until the graft reweights her legacy. Closure is a Charged Poise—the anchored kelp/coin reframes scars as song with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by word 60; causality intact via “memory triggers ritual reparation.” No meaningful tightening missed; cost legible in final sunbeam ignition of thread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains the graft: glassy surface mirrors sky, demanding precision in burial. Sensory hierarchy favors salt, damp stone, and resilience—POV-biased, not tourist. Black sand recurs with evolving stake: souvenir → apology → growth medium. Weather/cloud migration times the sunbeam payoff, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform inherited fire into life—signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful deepening: ceremonial graft forecloses passive remembrance; kelp must root or rot, staking reputation. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost visible on-page: coin surrendered, shame exposed, future failure possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate legacy emerges through recurrent graft image rather than statement. Final “scar become a song” lands as resonant reconfiguration, not moral. Subtext in red thread: lifeline that cannot burn. Avoids sermon; ambiguity (will kelp live?) invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—volcanic glass, kelp scent—filters through ex-arsonist’s vigilance. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences at rest, clipped fragments during graft knotting. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; poetic elevation justified by meditative ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + image) with near-zero scaffold. Metaphors (clouds like memories) stay coherent and sparse, avoiding purple overload. Clause variety supports lull-then-focus pacing. Only micro-loop: “black sand” repeated three times in 30 words mid-story; not at closure, so −0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter daughter of arsonist grafts kelp with criminal coin—transforms destructive geology into regenerative biology. Specific volcanic obsidian + Chilean peso root the premise irreplaceably. Pattern of geological fire → biological growth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in glowing thread image.</comment>
