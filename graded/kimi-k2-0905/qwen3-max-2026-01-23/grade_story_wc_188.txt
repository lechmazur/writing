<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her chant anchoring perception, her palm cradling the rag knot—but the “gravity of hopelessness” is declared, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she glides from arrival to revelation without micro-choice that costs her anything. The ending stance is legible, yet the emotional price is only asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: sensory density increases until the mosaic pattern breaks into blueprint. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—stone message reweights her vocation—felt cost is the spent rag knot tucked away, future labor now inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is lyric but coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Jasmine perfume, starless hush, and tile temperature are filtered through Elara’s pyrotechnician bias; every detail either guides her knees toward the mosaic or later reframes the dandelion seed image. The fortress functions as micro-setting that literally supplies the blueprint she will carry out. Environment constrains angle of light needed for revelation—tight integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defy color-leeching despair—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: flame reveals hidden design, foreclosing ignorance; cost is the consumed rag knot and the new burden of execution. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial; escalation is a cadence shift from sensory overload to focused blueprint—sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as quiet insurgency. Mosaic’s line “Hope is a seed planted in darkness” is on-page yet earned by prior floral/decay imagery. Final image of sky-born seeds reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will villages care?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tight to Elara’s pyro-perceptual lexicon—“sky-flower,” “ignition formulas.” Rhythm swells with her chant; no head-hopping. Filter-verb use (“she felt”) is minimal and voice-motivated. Distinctive, consistent, and propulsive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to short flare of revelation. Figurative layering is high but patterned—fire, bloom, seed—taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle (“liquid memory”) barely grazes clarity. Otherwise clean, dense, read-aloud strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fireworks designer reading blueprints in starless fortress-mosaic is fresh synthesis. The “serious playfulness” of Kael’s gift and the silent-seed firework concept transform familiar hope-against-despair arc into tactile invention. Risk resides in lyric stillness; it holds. Not ground-breaking, but memorably specific.</comment>
