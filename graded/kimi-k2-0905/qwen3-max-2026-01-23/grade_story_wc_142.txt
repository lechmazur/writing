<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—order vs intuition—surfaces early and steers every graffiti decision; the stone chip anchors lineage pressure. Yet his emotional register stays cerebral; we’re told “hopeful desperation” rather than shown body-level cost. The final smile feels earned but lightweight because no personal stake (job, safety, reputation) is risked on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the network is live, OmniCorp still coming, but community voice is now irreversible—cost felt in the dawn stakes. Causal chain intact: each mural choice → network growth → shared resolve. One transition (dusk to dawn) is clean; orientation anchored by 80 words. No plot amnesia; graffiti code stays consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Salt-bleached wood, candy-striped tents, and Ferris-wheel shadow give tactile raft topology; micro-setting (charcoal pouch, stone chip) constrains every tagging move. Spice-market air and rope-bridge sway filter through Kael’s carnival-trained senses. Final nautilus shell re-uses earlier visual DNA, charging the closing image. No white-room lapses; geography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cultural survival vs structural collapse—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each new mural tightens the invisible net, deepening consequence of exposure. No reversal, but a meaningful tightening when Elara’s keyhole widens the conspiracy. Cost remains communal, not personal, capping intensity at the high 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of encoded memory vs corporate erasure emerges through paint, not sermon. Graffiti evolves from decoration to neural net—an organic metaphor for collective resistance. Final anthem image reweights earlier “perpetual carnival” from escapism to resilience. No explicit thesis, but subtext could sharpen if a single elder’s lost story were dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual lens: “salt-tinged wind,” “calliope music” filtered through carnival-bred synapses. Syntax mirrors his orderly intuition—balanced clauses, rhythmic semicolons—without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; narrative idiom remains consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“felt like erasure”) is forgivable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: sensory triads propel rather than stall. Occasional stacked modifiers (“breathtaking, chaotic mosaic”) flirt with purple but serve stakes. No loops, clean pronouns, strong verbs. Final paragraph softens impact with three abstract nouns in one line; a concrete after-image would sharpen cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as data-resistance platform feels fresh; graffiti-as-WAN remixes familiar cyberpunk tropes into salt-soaked wood. Premise commits fully—no late tech rule dumps. Specificity of nautilus map and seven-star safehouses prevents generic swap-out. Risk lies in quiet ending; payoff trusts reader to value cultural code over explosion.</comment>
