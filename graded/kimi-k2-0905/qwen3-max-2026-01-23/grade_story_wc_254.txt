<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The poet’s drive is declared (“aesthetically driven in every breath”) rather than dramatized through micro-choices that cost him anything. The final kneel and hand-to-ice beat is the only embodied action that fuses motive to body; earlier beats are observational. Earned stasis is present, but the lack of visible trade-off keeps it below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the boundary dissolves by paraphrase, lake and atrium fuse, and the colonnade’s hum flips from warning to welcome—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens is taught early and held. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. The only drag is a mid-text loop of “the method of dissolving boundaries” repeated three times without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly sensory and filter through the poet’s cloud-shadow aesthetic. The colonnade itself constrains the final action—its hum modulates as the paraphrase proceeds—so micro-setting qualifies for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and props never drift. Weather and light evolve causally with the beats.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to the banned atrium—is signaled in line 1 and tightens once: the paraphrase either opens or fails. Escalation is present but gentle; the deepening is cadence/texture rather than a narrowed option or price. No credible loss is dramatized—failure is never entertained—so cost legibility is modest. Agency is pure performance (speech) rather than risk of body or reputation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: language as permeable architecture. The final image—ice singing back to quartz—reweights the premise without moralizing. Motif recurrence (hush, hum, paraphrase) is purposeful, not ornamental. The only echo of sentimentality is “profound peace,” but it is immediately grounded in the kneel-to-ice beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a cloud-shadow perceptual signature: colors, reflected light, hush. Syntax modulates—short declarative beats under pressure, longer circling clauses during reflection. No head-hopping; distance stays shallow and consistent. The diction never drifts above the poet’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is supple, with sentence length and paragraph breaks breathing with the hum. Figurative load is high but patterned—cloud, stone, water—so density penalty is waived. Only loop artifacts: “the method of dissolving boundaries” triple repeat, and “humming quartz colonnade” appears four times with identical epithet. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles obey physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise—poet dissolves magical ban by paraphrase—is fresh, but execution leans on familiar lyric-mystic tropes (frozen lake, crystalline pillars, lantern-moth hush). Specificity of the cloud-shadow aesthetic helps, yet swap poet to painter and paraphrase to brushstroke with minor edits. The final crystalline note is a lovely micro-turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
