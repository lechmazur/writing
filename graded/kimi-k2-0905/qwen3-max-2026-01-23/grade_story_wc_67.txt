<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her tactile ritual choices reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The contradiction between her stated purpose (“release”) and her meticulous control crystallizes in the final scatter, earning a credible renunciation. No stock phrasing; every micro-choice (powdering one shard, brushing dust into the silver bowl) is character-specific. Cost is visible: the stilled chair and the ash map on its seat foreclose any redo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s final stillness reconfigures the entire ritual as an irreversible threshold. Causality is accumulative/textural—each stroke of charcoal adds density until the scattered dust reweights the premise. The lens is taught by 25% and held; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the last line: “the fleeting had become eternal,” a conceptual forfeiture of revision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gallery’s “precise angles” of light and the chair’s diminishing creak function as micro-setting that constrains tempo; the chair’s final silence is the tightening agent. Porcelain dust caught in the wood-grain supplies the charged image that locks the ending. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s professional filter—she notices texture, weight, tremor, not décor. Spatial choreography is immaculate: shard → mortar → paper → bowl → seat, every object tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallize the grandmother’s hidden grief—signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Elara decides to draw “the sorrow it concealed,” not the mask. One meaningful deepening suffices: the rocking chair’s fading creak acts as a live metronome that narrows temporal options. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent. Cost is visible in the ash scatter that ends the ritual—she forfeits the mask’s last physical fragment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety is not wholeness but the courage to let light hit fractures. The gold-lacquered cracks reappear as luminous dust, reweighting the premise without a moral. Subtext resides in silence—the grandmother’s absent voice and the stilled chair say more than any epiphany could. Final image (“porcelain dust on skin”) offers a non-literal answer: vulnerability is the ground of connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—she sees “luminous, fine dust,” not “white powder.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, then compresses at the scatter, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is active (“she performed,” “she brushed,” “she scattered”). Voice modulation under pressure is evident: clauses shorten as the chair slows. Distinct diction throughout—no tourism-catalog phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, character, or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“melancholy snow” is earned because the particles are literally drifting. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the gold-lacquer motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the rocking cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “portrait ash scatterer” occupation is fresh yet inevitable—only this job could transmute porcelain dust into emotional cartography. Kintsukuroi mask + charcoal portraiture synthesizes two existing arts into a new ritual. Risk is high: a quiet, reflective arc hinging on a single scatter, yet coherence never wavers. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the entire emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
