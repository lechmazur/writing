<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s gentle perseverance is credible, but the interiority stays decorative (“blithe spirit,” “tenderly organized heart”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No micro-choice after the first thread-pull risks passivity; the final resolve is asserted, not earned under fresh pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—spiral pattern reweights Albright’s resignation into mentorship with felt cost for the town. Accumulative lens holds: each decoded thread tightens meaning without causal turns. Orientation clear by 60 words; one soft paraphrase loop mid-text (−0.2) keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt silo, star-roof, and needle-lid function as micro-setting that channels attention and physically enables decoding; atmosphere stays consistent and filters through Elara’s gardener eye. Smell of cemetery soil after green-thread pull grounds the echo, charging the final spiral image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode intention—tightens once when the spiral pattern emerges, foreclosing the misbelief of surrender. No visible price exacted from Elara herself; cost is observational, not personal, keeping it below 8.2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of generational teaching emerges via pattern, not statement; final spiral reweights Albright’s “defeat” into legacy. Avoids preachiness, lets ambiguity linger whether Liam will heed the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s gardener diction—“velveteen gloom,” “fallow ground”—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for tapestry work, clipped close after cobalt-thread sigh. One register spike (“Conceptual Repricing”) is evaluator, not text.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong sensory specificity; only minor scaffold (“threads, each a potential vessel for a whispered memory” restates prior). No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; figurative language disciplined to one image per beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Chess-resignation-as-lesson is fresh, but “tapestry border hides mentor’s voice” leans fairy-tale familiar. Transformation saves it: gardener uses needle & lens—Albright’s own repair tools—to decode, making cemetery craft the engine of insight.</comment>
