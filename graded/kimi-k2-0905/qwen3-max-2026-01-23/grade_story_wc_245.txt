<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—grief is felt through bark, dew, ring-heat—yet the arc is almost frictionless: every step confirms progress, no blind-spot error or temptation to abandon. The mentor’s quoted maxim is the only overt diagnosis, but it’s brief and grounded in touch. A single micro-choice (kneel, palms to earth) crystallizes acceptance, cost felt in cooling ring and softened “sharp edges.” Meets 9- gate: contradiction present, change earned, cost on page.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of musical absorption → density rises → cadence shift into absolute silence lands Charged Poise with cost (ring cools, grief map complete). Orientation clean by line 5; no causal reversals needed under this lens. Closure beat “grief and love are intertwined notes” reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Penalty-free; meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies quiet on cue, thorns vibrate caution, stillpoint silences all—environment directly shapes tactics and final image. Micro-setting (platinum ring) likewise constrains path. Sensory hierarchy obeys blind POV: touch and vibration trump sight, every detail filtered through dowsing hand. Spatial choreography immaculate across 326-word trek.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grief navigation—signaled early; pressure tightens via rising sensory density until silence delivers irreversible shift. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates through accumulating notes that demand integration. Cost legible: ring’s heat loss and “sharp edges softened.” One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; meets 8.8 gate for visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges concretely: cartography of sorrow via vibration, love/grief as single chord. No moralizing; final image reconfigures mentor’s loss into forward-carrying map. Recurring musical motif accumulates meaning without checklist tokenism. Ambiguity lingers—forest keeps humming—yet emotional logic feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close to Elara: tactile diction, rhythmic sentence variation that mimics sonic intake, no head-hop. Slight elevation toward “quiet blaze revelation” is earned by prior pattern of heat/silence. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice stays consistent under stress. Distinct perceptual signature maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—each sentence layers sense, stakes, metaphor—yet rhythm breathes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Mixed metaphors avoided; “ping” on quartz as high C is precise. Minor scaffold: “quiet blaze” repeated thrice could be pared once, but never muddles closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind dowsing + ultrasonic forest + emotional cartography feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in lyric_accumulative structure pays off via silence punchline. Could swap mentor for parent?—but forest and ring are irreplaceable. Meets 9- gate for non-obvious angle and charged ending.</comment>
