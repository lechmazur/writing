<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the stone’s warning vs. compulsion to invert it—surface in the decisive moment of lever-pulling; the tear-streaked cheeks embody the visible cost of her renunciation of linear fate, fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed beam rewrites the stone’s “weep” into “awake,” a legible before/after with felt cost; the causal chain (yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → clutch swap → inverted lens) holds without gaps under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse mechanism, body-as-micro-setting, and tide-tracked hunger stone constrain every tactical move; the final silver beam carves definition from dark, charging the closing image with irreversible alteration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—prove time is a puzzle, not prison—tightens when the exposed stone and nadir tide foreclose hesitation; protagonist’s clutch-disengagement is the irreversible trade-off that pays the visible cost of rewriting the beacon’s law.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion act itself: suffering isn’t erased but overlaid with possibility; the ephemeral “awake” reframes famine history without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity charged by the closing sweep of silver light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature—brass smell, grime-cheek tears, salt-resolve breath; rhythmic escalation matches the whir-counter-whir of gears, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sentences vary from wind-whisper fragments to gear-train clauses; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; high density—“bruised twilight,” “quiet desperation”—yet every image advances atmosphere or stakes without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The ancient yoyo as harmonic governor for time-inversion is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking (counter-clockwise beacon) heightens coherence and stakes, making the reversal feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
