<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving the luminous gold-green of wonder—remains steady and personal, but the interiority stays lyrical rather than contradictory; no clashing impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final choice (infusing the seed) is causally earned, yet the cost is more symbolic than viscerally felt on her body or future. A single micro-choice under tension would have pushed this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing—the seed now glows with distilled wonder, foreclosing her option to keep it idle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chromatic thread tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the stakes. Causality is intact, cost is legible, and no orientation debt accrues. A sharper external constraint or price would have nudged it past 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet, moss, mist, and waterfall create a tactile micro-setting that doubles as ritual space; the seed’s glow at the end recharges the opening dawn light, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays biased toward Elara’s orchard-trained eye. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. One more environmental pushback—wind, cold, vertigo—would have tightened the 8.8+ window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve wonder against creeping gray—is signaled early and intensifies through each gathered color strand; the final infusion constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. A tangible, on-page sacrifice (fatigue, blood, memory) would have lifted the cost into the 8.5+ zone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder as cultivar that must be grafted into future fruit. The final image of the gold-green bud reconfigures the opening dawn without moralizing. Subtext operates in chromatic silence rather than statement. One earlier contradiction—wonder versus pragmatic necessity—would have deepened resonance toward 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s orchard-honed perceptual signature; diction of “bark and bud,” “living loom,” and “seasoned wood” is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates from long breath-like sentences to the clipped “This was the succor,” mirroring her inward plunge. No head-hopping or register drift. A single syntactic surprise at climax could have hit 9.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet read-aloud clean; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“liquid silver” returns as “luminous in-between”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information often dual-purposes: “emerald moss softened ancient stone” grounds footing and signals time’s layering. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt… she felt…”) keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The chromatic soul-graft onto an heirloom seed feels fresh; orchard magic is rarely framed as color conservation. The concept’s internal logic is followed without late rule changes. Risk is moderate—lyric interiority rather than plot pyrotechnics—but coherence remains high. A bolder structural risk (split timeline, competing POV) could have pushed 8.8.</comment>
