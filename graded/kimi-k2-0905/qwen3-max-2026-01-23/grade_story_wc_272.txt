<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s shame-knot is embodied in tactile thread-work; the self-compassion payoff is earned because the untangling beats dramatize micro-choices that rewire his artistic identity. Interiority stays concrete (“luminescent ache warming his palms”) and avoids label-speak. The arc from avoidance to descent-and-repair is credible and scaled to length, though the mentor-love beat is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each untangling act tightens the weave and dissolves the lighthouse’s collapse, landing a clear Decisive Change with felt cost—the retained ache that now fuels purpose. Orientation is anchored by word 23; no teleporting props or retro patches. The spiral redesign is the persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library-cellar environment is filtered through painterly perception; salt, mildew, and starlit threads constrain finger-work and supply the only light source for descent. The tarot box reappears whole, recharging the earlier fracture image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves from desk to iron door to cellar web.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can broken meaning be re-woven?”—is signaled early and tightened by each knot that narrows options until the obsidian spiral demands acceptance. Agency is continuous: every untangling act alters the hum and the walls’ pressure. Cost is visible as cold stone on shoulders and the final transformed ache he chooses to keep.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the weave itself: truth needs darkness as canvas for light. No final moralizing; the last line’s “luminescent ache” reprises and reweights the gallery’s earlier critique. Rhetorical questions stay subordinate to action, functioning as micro-mantras that focus intent rather than spelling out thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains painterly perceptual signature—color-as-emotion, composition metaphors—without POV leakage. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for descent, clipped fragments when walls groan. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction control, which holds even under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold loops; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“liquid starlight” → “liquid dawn”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor paraphrase overlap between “luminescent ache” uses, but the reprise is purposeful and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reality-weaving via tarot threads is fresh, yet grounded in maritime-lighthouse lore; the spiral redesign feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. The crestfallen-artist trope is revitalized through tactile thread-therapy instead of generic epiphany. Risk taken in lyric compression succeeds under 800-word cap.</comment>
