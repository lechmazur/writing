<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is viscerally embodied (scarred fingers, marrow-pressure) and her micro-choice— one precise mental nudge—launches the entire plot; the interior contradiction between hunting truth and fearing its weight is alive in every beat. No other characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A; the endurance she earns (“ready to listen”) is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The flaw that she can’t stop picking at the wound is the engine, not a decorative label. Voice never slips into therapy-speak; “bleak exhilaration” is shown via the geode’s hum and tear-paths, not asserted. 9+ gate missed only because the final stance crystallizes without a fresh micro-choice in the last 60 words; cost is felt but not dramatized anew.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each reiterated image (geode, Earth below, circuit hum) tightens density until the “silent ocean” of pooled potential reweights every prior loss. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the future becomes “a canvas alive with echoes” — conceptual cost undeniable, no options reset. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“floating observatory’s cold steel”) inside 50 words; waiver applies. No causal turns required under this lens; pattern is taught early (“minute disturbances”) and paid off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the pools will keep whispering every time breakers cool—she now carries that antenna inside her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The geode’s lattice and the viewport’s cold steel function as micro-setting, constraining her hand and gaze; their recurrence recharges the final image. Stationary choreography is flawless—no teleporting props. Sensory hierarchy obeys trauma: sight narrows to Earth’s wound, touch to crystal warmth, bone-pressure replaces hearing. “Wounded and beautiful” is POV-colored, not tourist-tag. The floating observatory never becomes a white room because its silence (dead breakers) is the ticking clock that permits the vision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused potential pool?”—signals in line 4 and tightens exactly once when the stillness emerges, foreclosing her prior metaphysical ignorance. Cost is legible: she must carry the “intangibly tangible” weight forever; this is the price of the hunt. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening of image-density (geode→Earth→silent ocean) is sufficient escalation; coincidence never rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: unused potential is not lost but stored, and bearing witness to it is more courageous than vengeance. The geode’s shift from inert to humming is the motif that reprices meaning at closure. Final image—“ready to listen for the pools”—offers a non-literal answer: the lens is auditory now, not retributive. No moralizing, no sermon; the insight is inseparable from her scarred palm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a distinct perceptual signature: physics vocabulary (“perturbation,” “lattice,” “quantum static”) is filtered through bereaved synesthesia—grief tastes like pressure in bone marrow. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during the vision, then exhales into longer cadence as power returns. No dialogue to distort. POV distance remains tight-third; no head-hop. Register never drifts above Elara’s plausible scientific literacy. Compression (“intangibly tangible”) is taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High density: one sentence often performs three jobs—“The geode, salvaged from the chapel rubble where Liam’s ring had glinted moments before impact, was her resonator” = backstory, emotional stakes, object function. Rhythm breathes with beats. No filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “silent ocean.” Proof-level clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—trauma-driven quantum cartography of lost futures—is non-obvious and commits fully; no retreat into metaphor. Synthesis of hard-science diction with grief-body is fresh, not a checklist. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseeable: of course the pools wait in the cooling window of dead circuits. Risk in compression (“intangibly tangible”) heightens coherence. Could not swap geode for any other object without breaking lattice logic. Emotional specificity avoids generic “loss is universal” template.</comment>
