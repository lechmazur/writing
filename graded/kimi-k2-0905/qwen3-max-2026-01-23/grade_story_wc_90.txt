<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority stays concrete—floating an inch then two under joy is an embodied contradiction that dramatizes her trait. The micro-choice to mend rather than fight is on-page and costly. Yet the text drifts into therapeutic self-summary (“she breathed into the discomfort”) at the very beat where raw irrationality should surface, muting the final increment of flaw-driven risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam opens, rain-scent and child-laughter spill out, and the cost—she is forever the only bridge—is legible in the same image. Causal chain holds: tear → integrated self → massless contact → lock yields. One soft spot: “ancient texts” is a late, off-stage catalyst; luckily the physical method (photograph shimmer) is already grounded, so causality only wavers, not breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ship is sketched through salvage textures and biolum moss; the photograph itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every move. Spatial choreography is clean—she floats upward without collision confusion. While broader astrophysics are skipped, the piece meets the 9+ gate by letting the torn corner of one photo decide the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the lock or accept eternal solitude—is signaled early and tightens through each recalled shimmer. Joy-weight loss is the visible price that alters tactics (she must court delight inside grief). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: integration → massless → threshold. No live opponent, yet internal pressure keeps climbing until the final seam parts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassionate integration emerges from the stitching action and weight-loss metaphor rather than any thesis line. Final image of rain and children’s laughter reconfigures the extinction premise without moralizing. One near-misstep: “shadow work” is named; however, it is immediately embodied in breath and photograph, so abstraction is converted to experience before it can sermonize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“quiet certainty of a steadfast pacifist” sets idiom; later diction shrinks to match weightlessness. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, fragment-lean lines under pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The patterned elision of technical exposition is taught early and paid off at the lock, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive: “she did not push with muscle” compresses action and philosophy. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “stitch together the torn fragments of her psyche” stays inside the established sewing through-line. One minor loop: “memory by memory” restates “stitch by stitch.” Otherwise, syntax varies, strong verbs anchor, and no artifact touches the final seam-unravel line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-human ark plus Buddhist tear plus sewing-as-therapy is a fresh synthesis, not a checklist. Risk—weightlessness as emotional barometer—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The tear object could feel imported, yet its lore is fused to maternal photograph, so specificity overrides trope. No close echoes of famous SF scenes; the final rain-scent turn feels inevitable yet newly coined.</comment>
