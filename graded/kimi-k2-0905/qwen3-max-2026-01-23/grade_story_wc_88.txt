<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—needing to feel while fearing the cost—are dramatized in embodied tremors and the micro-choice to release the baseball; the empathic turn is earned by cumulative memory flashes that carry visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each newspaper clue → tunnel fork → narrowing options; closure lands with Decisive Change (lake gifts felt empathy) and visible cost (baseball forfeited, tears wash numbness), satisfying high-band gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fungal-lit lake and tunnel geography are specific, tactile, and charge the final image; baseball as micro-setting constrains the pivotal surrender. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recover empathy—tightens when each decoded fragment forecloses retreat; lake confrontation forces final stance with felt price. One meaningful escalation sufficient under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern of “light in dark” without sermon; lake reweights the baseball’s inscription into lived compassion. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compressed lyric diction mirrors Kael’s clinical-erased mind; rhythmic control heightens under pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Single POV default met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops; figurative language disciplined to one vehicle per beat. Syntax breathes with emotional cadence, climaxing in clean closure image. No artifact near ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neural wipe + newspaper cipher tunnel + bioluminescent empathy lake feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (elliptical descent, concept-heavy) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
