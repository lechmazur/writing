<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but keeps distance; “map empathy onto action” is stated, not embodied. Calm intuition stays static—no contradiction undercuts it—so the final act feels preordained rather than earned. Shadow-laced body is vivid, yet no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with cost; kneeling and planting read as ritual, not risky decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fragment → mirrors → synthesis → orchard healed. Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration—golden wave reverts ice, blossoms erupt—cost is the peacekeeper’s shadow now permanently re-colored, a visible price. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the “weighted breath before reply” is declarative, not dramatized, so the world-pause feels told.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard above groaning ice is anchored early and every mirror glimpse re-etches it. Micro-setting triumph: the warm crystal shard pressed between root and stone becomes the fulcrum; that tactile node decides the climax. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—beeswax, tarnished silver, salt-weathered door—never tourist excess. Environment bends choice: granite, ice, and mirrored memory conspire to force the empathic graft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the orchard from encroaching ice—is clear in paragraph 1. Escalation is lyric-accumulative: each mirror glimpse layers emotional density until the bud/ice/seed triad fuses into the healing surge. No narrowing of options; the task is always “restore,” so pressure is existential, not tactical. Cost is present but diffuse—the shard’s warmth, the shadow’s new color—felt yet not sharpened to a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathic restoration emerges through mirrored emotional echoes, never slogan. Final blossom cascade reweights the opening monochrome world without moralizing. Subtext hums in the shard’s shift from “unnaturally cold” to “golden luminescence,” making compassion a thermodynamic event—quietly conceptual. Avoids tidy maxim; orchard’s sigh and ice’s cradle leave plausible counter-readings about interventionist cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance; shadow-laced perception flavors syntax—“visual echo,” “smoke,” “indigo threads.” No head-hop; compression (“The air thickened. The ice’s groan ceased.”) teaches the pattern and pays off in the hush before bloom. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: long clause for intuition, staccato for mirror flashes, then tidal surge at release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence length and paragraph cuts match breath of escalating wonder. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors—“dew-kissed blossom glowing with impossible warmth” is singular and precise. Information density high: each sentence advances image or causality. One scaffold echo: “fragment” repeated three times in five lines mid-text; minor, does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-fantasy rescue is retooled through memory-mirrors and empathic cartography—fresh mechanism. Shadow-laced body, orchard-on-cliff, ice as sentient cradle synthesize into a memorable biopunk-fairy tale hybrid. Risk is taken: no antagonist, no dialogue, pure lyric causality—and it coheres. Could edge higher if the peacekeeper’s personal stakes were less interchangeable with the orchard’s.</comment>
