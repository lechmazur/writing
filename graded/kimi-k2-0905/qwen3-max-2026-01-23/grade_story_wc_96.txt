<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fear of the molt is embodied in the throat-tightening beat—and the seed-in-palm micro-choice visibly enacts the shift from Silas to root-voice. The monthly persona change is more label than lived contradiction until Kael’s speech; still, the final surrender carries credible cost under the Accumulative lens. Relationship as crucible works: Kael’s calm challenge directly alters her stance, foreclosing retreat. No head-count or status drift; anchor stays tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted seed crystallizes the “luminous fracture” rule—beauty through brokenness—with felt cost (Silas dissolved). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (library memory, courtyard work, moonlight mosaic) deepens the stake until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (memory block) is taught early and repaid at closure. Persistent constraint—monthly molt—shapes tactics and is accepted, not solved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted beams, starlight tessellation, and the dented tin are filtered through Elara’s poet-eye; every detail performs metaphoric work without overt symbolism. The library’s spatial ribs guide the final moonlit planting; the courtyard earth is tactile and choice-altering. Weather (rain-washed metal scent) lingers as honest texture, not backdrop. No geographic drift; props (tin, seed) tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the poet keep the resistance alive through the molt?—is signaled in paragraph 4. Pressure tightens once: fear of abandonment rises, then is rebutted by Kael’s beam-of-light image, forcing acceptance. Cost is legible: loss of Silas’s granite voice, replaced by uncertain root-voice. No external antagonist needed; internal/external stakes braid through the communal rebuild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: renewal through fracture, collective labor as art. No final-paragraph thesis; the seed in soil is the silent answer. Motif of “blooming resistance” recurs only via lived action (donated books, mended chairs) so it earns weight. Ambiguity remains—will the new poet succeed?—yet the reconfiguration feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “rusted iron beams clawing” is her poet-mind, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences under moonrise, clipped fragments at the shiver of molt. No head-hop; Kael’s dialogue is spare, warm, distinct from Elara’s imagistic interiority. Compression (“luminous fracture”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—light, rust, seed—so it reads as intentional texture, not purple overload. Strong verbs (“clawed,” “fractured,” “surrenders”) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The monthly molt-as-poetic-method feels fresh, especially when paired with community architecture; no trope echo detected. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no showdown, only planting—yet coherence holds. Specificity of Carnegie skeleton and prison-library origin keeps the frame from feeling generic. Transformation test fails if swapped to any poet; the molt mechanic is integral.</comment>
