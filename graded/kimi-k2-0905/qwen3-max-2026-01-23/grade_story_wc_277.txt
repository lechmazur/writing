<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is crystal-clear and intensifies beat-by-beat; her contradictory grief/resolve is shown through tactile micro-choices (thumb on nib, deliberate ink stroke). The “proof-by-contradiction” method externalizes an interior logic and is consistently embodied rather than declared. Closure cost is visible in the tear/chuckle as she commits to publishing a painful truth, foreclosing the safe silence her grandfather staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under Causal lens: the staged-accident premise is decisively reversed by the nib’s planted clue, with social cost (family scandal) felt in the final drafting beat. Each deduction (locked shutter / fabricated frost) is a because/therefore step that narrows options toward the inevitable conclusion. Persistent constraint—the family name she must now publicly correct—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory is anchored within first 60 words; altitude and echoing dome constrain every sound and motion. Micro-setting objects—rosewood nib, Bakelite phone, brass chart table—function as tactile “rooms” that gate choices (nib bends only at shutter latch). Final draft table under green lamp re-uses the same objects with re-weighted meaning, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. family myth) is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through two concrete reversals: physical impossibility of the fall, then fabrication of weather. Each finding forecloses the “accident” option; the final choice to publish crystallizes the cost under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of printing, ink, and logical proof—truth as a literal printed correction. Subtext lives in the bent nib: contrition encoded in craft. Final image of dawn gilding clouds re-weights “orbit” from regret to public accountability without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is Victorian-observatory diction (“crystalline loneliness,” “domed aperture”) yet never drifts into purple. Syntax mirrors methodical deduction—parallel “Contradiction one / two” lines—creating rhythm of proof. No head-hop; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information-dense: each sentence either advances evidence or charges atmosphere (“sea of cloud”). Mixed metaphors avoided; “orbits of regret” recurs with accruing meaning rather than decoration. No loops or scaffold; final line cadence slows to match dawn light, satisfying closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines amateur-sleuth trope with newspaper-industry legacy; freshness lies in formal-logic method as emotional inheritance. Rosewood nib = clue-seed is non-obvious; bent tip’s meaning is retrospectively inevitable. Risk: overt thesis line “proof by contradiction” is named, not shown, but is earned by prior dramatized steps.</comment>
