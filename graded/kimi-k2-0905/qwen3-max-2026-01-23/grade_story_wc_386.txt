<comment>Elara’s quiet, reverence-driven motivation is vivid and consistent; her interiority is textured through sensory anchoring in ice and candlelight. The final choice—to write Lena and reframe Clara’s death as gift—grows believably from her established need to “salvage something pure.” Yet because no second character shares the scene, relationship pressure is absent and the cost is purely empathic rather than personal, keeping her just shy of the 9-band threshold.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the melted globe refracts a rainbow that re-weights the artifact from ruin to vessel of enduring love, paying the implicit cost of Elara’s solitary labor. Causal linkage holds—Lena’s dream → Elara’s dive → letter → rainbow—without gaps, and the Orientation Test is satisfied within the first 50 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara decides the message must reach Eleanor, foreclosing her anonymity; cost is legible in the frozen tear on her cheek.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glacier shrine is not backdrop but tool: its cold literally preserves the globe and candles, shapes Elara’s slowed breath, and supplies the final sunrise prism. Selective sensory triage—beeswax scent, ice names, slumped glass—mirrors her narrowed dive attention. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or teleports. The 9-band gate is missed only because the environment never actively endangers or blocks her, so constraint is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover a loving final image for the bereaved—is signaled early and deepened when Elara realizes the cameo is joy, not trauma. One decisive escalation: shifting from private witness to external messenger, narrowing her safe isolation. Cost is felt (the frozen tear, dawn exhaustion), yet pressure is largely internal; external stakes for Eleanor remain off-stage, capping intensity just below the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: love can outlast catastrophe if someone risks the cold work of retrieval. The melted globe’s final rainbow re-prices loss into legacy, answering the implicit question “What survives?” Subtext resides in gesture—letter sealed with crimson wax, light on ice—never exposition. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is earned through specific image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices ice names, candle gutters, warped glass, never external commentary. Syntax lengthens during the dream-dive, then tightens back to present-tense brevity, mirroring altered psychic distance. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice is distinctive enough for 9-band, but dialogue is absent, so the full vocal range cannot be verified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“glass dome slumped like a frozen tear”—never stacked. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with dive descent and resurfacing, culminating in the single-breath rainbow beat that clinches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing wreck-diver with dream-reading ghost-whisperer feels fresh, and the melted snow globe as memory vessel is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The concept commits fully: no late rule changes, no safety retreat into generic afterlife tropes. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the final prismatic image, making the innovation feel inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
