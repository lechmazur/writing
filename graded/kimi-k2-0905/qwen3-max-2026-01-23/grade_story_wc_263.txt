<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-blocked artist interiority is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to trace each meteor re-opens feeling with credible irrationality. The “rest” surrender is earned because every prior beat has forced her to confront her self-built cage. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; all pressure is internal and holds. Flaw: the grandmother’s remembered voice edges toward thematic echo, not full dramatized contradiction, keeping this just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each traced meteor tightens the emotional density until the final blaze delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration—“Rest” lands with felt cost as creativity uncoils. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear within 60 words. Causality is interior but coherent: tracing → memory surge → catharsis → release. One soft spot: the phrase “shadowed rapture” is stated more than dramatized in the final beat, a hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stone archway, brass astrolabe, and aurora function as micro-setting; the astrolabe’s cold metal against skin and the arch’s exhaled phrase constrain her ritual steps. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and auditory whispers over visual catalog. Weather (aurora) evolves from spectacle to benediction, mirroring internal thaw. Environment never stalls action; every detail is filtered through her moonstruck attention, charging the final palm-on-stone moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—signals in paragraph four and escalates via each meteor traced; the tightening is the memory flood that forces her to accept grief as fuel. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive. Cost is visible: tears blur stars, knees cold against stone, final “Rest” forecloses continued silence. One meaningful intensification suffices; coincidence (aurora timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse ratio of grief to creative flow; the reweighting is that stardust includes sorrow, not despite it. No moralizing—final insight is imaged as warmth spreading through chest. Subtext lives in unspoken wind and stone phrases, avoiding thematic echo until the grandmother’s line, which slightly over-articulates. Complexity remains: joy and loss hold hands without tidy synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly moored to Elara’s perceptual signature—selective starlight, scent of old charts, metallic taste of cold brass. Syntax lengthens during meteor tracing to mimic stitching, then shortens at surrender. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Register remains poetic yet anchored in bodily sensation; no filter-verb stacks or corporate drift. Patterned repetition (“remembered stardust”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: long sentences for meteor arcs, clipped fragments at catharsis. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“warmth spread through her; the trapped creativity uncoiled softly”) costs 0.2. Otherwise high information density: each sentence advances memory, ritual, or release. No scaffolding, no template cadence, no artifact in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrolabe astronomy with emotional alchemy feels fresh; the “remembered stardust” concept reweights cosmic dust as shared lived particles. Risk: lyric accumulation rather than external plot could read as template, but here it is committed to fully. Transformation test fails if names swap, because the brass astrolabe and grandmother voice are specific. No close echoes of iconic scenes; aurora trope is redeemed by tactile ritual use.</comment>
