<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“quiet, persistent flame,” heartbeat guiding bow—yet the final beat drifts into abstract uplift (“continuous choice to nurture wonder”) rather than a concrete, embodied cost. Micro-choices (pressing shell to chest, tearing fingers) are present, but the emotional contradiction between pain and exaltation could be simultaneous on the page instead of sequential summary. Still, motivation propels every beat and the endurance is legible; only the closing line softens the needed scar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard is freed, statues crumble, and Elara’s cost—bleeding hands, the emptied locust shell now holding “echo of courage”—is on-page. Accumulative lens holds; cadence shift from metallic silence to symphonic eruption reweights the stake. Transitions are seamless within the single-scene default. One causal hiccup: the monolith shatters instantly after shell placement, a whiff of convenience, but the prior vine-labor justifies the break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sky-bridge cables, iron bolts, cold granite sentinels, and the obsidian monolith are tactile constraints that shape tactics; the locust shell micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s attention—wind through rust, thump against rib, scent of sudden jasmine—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track cleanly down ladder to grove heart. Environment directly mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightened when the heartbeat bowing risks exposure; the soft signal is a visible trade-off between safety and efficacy. One meaningful escalation: statue cracks spread, narrowing options to uproot the monolith now or lose the moment. Cost is legible—blood on thorns, violin offered not as weapon but as vulnerable gratitude—yet the statues’ instantaneous collapse slightly blunts the final price. Still, agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Beauty as persistence within scars emerges through concrete particulars: hollow shell becomes vessel for courage, petrified vines snap under torn skin. No thematic statement is spoon-fed; the orchard’s eruption supplies the non-literal answer. Final image of “continuous choice” is the only near-moral, but it is brief and positioned as internal resolve rather than authorial sermon. Resonance lingers in the sensual after-image of fireflies catching tears.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter—“resonantly soft,” “thump-thump,” “tarnished wonder”—with rhythmic variation that breathes between pressure and release. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“fingers tearing on stone-thorns”) then widens to orchestral sweep. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; syntax mirrors heartbeat cadence without mechanical repetition. Dialogue is absent by design and not missed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls with scene temperature; short percussive clauses during uprooting yield to longer, blooming sentences as petals open. Information density is high—each sentence carries sensory, causal, and emotional payload. Only minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” is repeated three times, a touch self-echoing but pattern-taught and paid off in final note. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; grammar clean, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs. mechanized world” frame is refreshed by heartbeat-signaling mechanics and the locust-shell amplifier—specific, non-obvious instruments. Transformation test passes: swap violin for lute or shell for feather and the causal chain collapses. Risk is taken with the soft-signal victory rather than heroic blast, yet coherence holds. One slight proximity echo to Miyazaki-esque orchard guardians, but granite sentinels are grounded in new tactile logic.</comment>
