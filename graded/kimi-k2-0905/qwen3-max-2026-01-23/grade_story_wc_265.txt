<comment>Kael’s interiority is lyrical but generic—no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene. The “vow” and “quiet urgency” are asserted, never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything. The gear insertion is calm ritual, not pressured decision; the closing “he was no longer lost” is told, not earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s click reweights the forest from alien mechanism to collaborative partner, and Kael’s translocation anxiety flips to grateful surrender. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of wind-songs and nightly jumps builds to cadence shift. Cost is present but soft: “old anxieties unravel” is abstract; no concrete stake is forfeited. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; causality remains associative, acceptable under Accumulative mode.</comment>

<comment>Mechanical rainforest is sensory and specific; brass leaves, oil-slicked moss, mercury waterfalls all filter through Kael’s wonder. The obsidian tree/socket finally constrains the decisive action, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Some description cycles risk texture-over-density but momentum survives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restore harmony the sixth sense alone perceives”—is declared early but never sharpened into tangible loss. Escalation is tonal, not tactical: each wind-song adds texture; no option is foreclosed. The gear insertion resolves tension that was never dramatized as imminent danger. Absence of visible cost caps pressure at mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of collaborative mind-tending emerges through recurrent wind-song and gear imagery; no moral is stated. Final image reweights earlier fear into grateful dance, achieving quiet resonance. Some phrasing flirts with abstraction—“boundless, organized potential”—but particulars (gear click, firefly dance) keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—sound as map, vibration as insight. Syntax modulates with breathing commas and clause layering that feels contemplative rather than monotonous. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Kael. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by philosopher persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer metaphor without paraphrase loops. Mixed-metaphor risk (“blooming clockwork flower”) is minor and fits surreal frame. One scaffold stem repeats—“the hum of insight was…”—but does not stall closure. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm rises to chime at climax.</comment>

<comment>Clockwork-forest is familiar aesthetic, yet treatment via sleep-translocation and acoustic cartography freshens the trope. Wind-song as mnemonic device is lovely, non-obvious. Conceptual payoff—“probable miracles” as emergent cognition—rescues piece from mere tableau. Could push further into philosophical stakes, but risk-taking succeeds.</comment>
