<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—detached technician vs. aching human—are dramatized in the single, embodied moment he presses the petal to his wrist; the raw tears that follow retroactively validate every calibrated micro-choice and renounce his former identity with undeniable cost. No stock interiority, no amnesia of competence; even the “static” sense is a lived, character-specific organ. The earned bridge persona at the end is the only possible synthesis of the traits shown. High-band gate met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each amber-to-violet light shift and static hum thickens the texture until the accidental grief ruptures the pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s subsume act crystallizes options with felt cost (“he lived it”). Persistent constraint: the spent petal left on the ledge literalizes the price. No orientation drift; pattern taught by 25 % and lands clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop; its shifting resin light literally calibrates the static readings that drive every beat. Micro-setting—the blotter petal—constrains the final choice and charges the last image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s professional nose/electric skin. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms or white-space syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve artistic purity vs. honor accidental truth. One meaningful tightening at dusk when the half-truth grief is detected; options narrow to destroy, sell, or subsume. Cost is visceral—he absorbs Elara’s raw sorrow, forfeiting synthetic detachment. Escalation is textural, not causal reversal, but pressure grows coherent under accumulative lens and charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframed object: counterfeit vs. authentic grief. The half-truth concept is reweighted at closure—integrity discovered inside flaw, not in spite of it. No moralizing; the spent petal on amber ledge is the silent conceptual repricing. Resonance invites reflection on all art’s accidental truths without asserting a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains Kael’s perceptual idiom—electric tingles, scent calibration—without head-hopping. Syntax tightens under pressure (“Static surged, flooding him…”) then exhales into longer cadence at close. No filter-verb scaffolding; diction stays within fragrance-dealer lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic signature held across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is spare, precise (“fossilized resin walls glowed like captured sunset”) and never congests high-pressure beats. Information density high—e.g., “static electricity translated the petal’s story into sensory echoes” compresses premise + method + result in one clause. Final line cadence mirrors static hum; closure image unmarred by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Counterfeit-emotion dealer who literally ingests his own product to discover authentic grief is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk taken: accumulative lyric escalation rather than causal plot, yet coherence holds. Specific detail—static as detection organ, amber grotto as lab—prevents swap with generic scentscape. Concept follows implications without retreat; no derivative template echo.</comment>
