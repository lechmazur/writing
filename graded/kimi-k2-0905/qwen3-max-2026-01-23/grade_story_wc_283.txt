<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quietly urgent motivation is anchored in tangible ritual; the 40-year button archive and the canyon-echo jar give her interiority weight. The final choice—to carry the mosaic to the square—pays off prior causality with felt cost (foregoing hermitic safety). No contradiction under pressure; her endurance is stoic yet charged. Would need one more micro-choice crack in mid-scene to hit 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the black grain’s suspension reweights prophecy from doom to communal call, cost legible in the crack silencing itself. Accumulative lens holds: button catalog, echo release, and mosaic assemble toward the final crystallized stance. Orientation beats anchor by line 5; no teleporting props. One tightening shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, petrified bench, and cliff geometry constrain her archiving ritual and the final exit; spatial anchors track cleanly. Canyon echo as micro-setting vibrates through the hall, integrating atmosphere with action. Selective sensory layering (honeyed gloom, suspended grain) mirrors internal shift without clutter. Could edge higher if the crack’s dust physically redirected her movements one beat earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—convert fatal prophecy into communal agency—signals early and tightens when the ceiling crack bleeds dust, forcing her to externalize the mosaic. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each button pair adds connective threads until the black-grain hover reweights risk. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt but lightly articulated—hence stops short of 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fragmentary memory as structural counterforce to geological collapse. Subtext resides in object pairings—star/river-stone, raincoat/wedding—arguing that collective micro-stories equal tectidal strength. Final image of suspended black grain conceptually re-prices prophecy without moralizing. No thematic echo; complexity honored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains petrified-wood cadence, compressing time through sensory metaphor without purple drift. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in catalog beats, clipped phrases at ceiling crack. Canyon echo’s release paid off in rhythmic vibration. Distinct perceptual signature holds; no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers image, memory, and emotional calculus. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; figuratives stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Zero loops, filter-verb clusters, or scaffold. One minor adverbial softener ("quietly inspired" repeated) keeps it from 9.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Button archive as divinatory practice feels fresh and specific; prophecy unscrambling via lost clothing hardware is non-obvious. Canyon echo jar reprises wind inside warehouse—organic synesthesia rather than ornament. Conceptual risk (collapsing cliffs rewritten by communal mending) commits fully. Slight risk hedging in too-tidy ceiling hush prevents 9+.</comment>
