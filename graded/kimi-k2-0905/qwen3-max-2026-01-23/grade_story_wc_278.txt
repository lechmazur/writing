<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, the exact cry she once ignored—so the final self-reckoning lands with felt cost. The trait of translating cries is shown mid-action, not labeled, and directly forces her climactic hum. One minor slip: “profound loneliness” is half-tell; still, the contradictory impulse (urge to silence vs need to answer) plays out in real time, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: her answer-hum reweights the firmware from chaos to chime, cost visible in the cooled amber she now has to carry. Causal chain holds—amber + translated cry = tether—without late rule dumps. Orientation is taught by line 4 (lab of lost sounds) and anchors hold; no caps triggered. Lens stays Accumulative: pattern of preserved moments tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lab is sketched via function (clocks ticking backward, static needles) that pressures her tactic; the amber-as-micro-setting constrains the final node placement. Sensory selection stays POV-bound—ozone, beeswax, body-warmed resin—never catalog. One hairline slip: “tapestry of time” risks platitude, but it immediately grounds in three concrete glimpses, so the final image still charges. Amber’s tactile return at end satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hush her own guilt-amplified dissonance—is signaled early and tightens when she recognizes the archived cry as her niece’s. The meaningful deepening is the micro-choice to hum rather than mute; it forecloses denial with on-page cost (guilt edges softened yet forever embedded in amber). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the haunted sound. Visible price: she pockets the cooled stone, perpetual reminder.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of preserved moments—wasp, letters, amber, star-map—each a bid to hold what otherwise vanishes. The close offers conceptual repricing: some sounds aren’t meant to be lost, only translated; no moral is preached. The insight grows from her specific failure, making the final star a quiet guide rather than judgment. Subtext in the hum (“I see you”) answers every prior cry without overt statement.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual filter: Orion on skin, resin scent, firmware static felt as “needles of pure sorrow.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short pulses under sonic pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression (“meteor hush”) is pattern-taught early and repaid in final silence. Voice stays character-bound and rhythmically controlled at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each image does double duty (amber = time capacitor + guilt capacitor). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language thins during the high-stakes hum so the sonic act itself stands clear. Sentence variety supports the tidal build-reverse-release of the cry. Minor cadence echo in “folded time smoothed…” is intentional and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “haunted tech + regret” arc but makes the ghost her own dismissed cry, translated via constellation artistry rather than tech jargon. The amber-as-capacitor and wasp-as-witness feel inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Structural risk—lyric accumulative instead of causal plot—heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection: tattooist remaps inner sky after using her skin-art logic on sound itself.</comment>
