<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus longing to rejoin—are rendered through tactile micro-choices (smoothing the invitation, lighting the candle) and embodied memory. The final renunciation of physical presence is earned because the astral eavesdropping beat dramatizes forgiveness first. Interiority occasionally drifts toward self-help register (“enlarged tranquility”), trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the atlas page becomes a map of return, reconfiguring isolation into voluntary guardianship with felt cost—she forgoes the hall forever. Causal chain holds: crumpled invitation → ritual projection → overheard absolution → re-shelving the paper. One transition (library → astral hall) is legible under lyric-ritual pattern; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moonlit dust, chained atlas, and beeswax candle are re-used, choice-relevant objects; the atlas physically cages the invitation, charging the final image. Micro-setting (body at desk, palms on paper) constrains the astral projection ritual. Sensory hierarchy favors archival scent and texture over visual cliché, sustaining atmospheric pressure without stall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus self-forgiveness—tightens when the astral eavesdropping reveals the society’s compassion, foreclosing her need to grovel. Midnight clock supplies real-time pressure. Cost is legible: she accepts permanent upstairs exile in exchange for restored purpose. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of paradoxical return emerges from concrete ritual action rather than assertion; the invitation’s journey from shame-token to atlas bookmark reweights “hiding” as bridge. Final image of candle reflected in window offers non-literal answer: sanctuary is chosen, not imposed. No moralizing sentence intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—ink-stained fingers, hollow click of empty case—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during astral drift, then shortens on physical return, mirroring consciousness state. Diction remains within archivist lexicon; no corporate register leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (moonlight bleeding, library sighing) are sparse enough to avoid purple clutter. No loops or scaffold detected. One mixed metaphor—“weight dissolved into light”—is minor, does not touch closure beat, so only hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Secret-society library inside public archive” plus astral attendance is a fresh synthesis of urban-fantasy and bibliophile tropes. The invitation-as-map twist feels inevitable after early hiding beat. Risk in quiet astral projection rather than physical confrontation pays off by reconfiguring exile as empowerment.</comment>
