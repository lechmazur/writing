<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the “wistfully pragmatic” trait is dramatized through the nightly ritual and shoulder-fatigue cost. Contradictory impulses—retreat vs. outreach—coexist in the same beats. The final renunciation (ending the ritual, cradling the thorn) is earned and charged. Only minor slip: Mateo’s interiority is ventriloquised with perfect certainty for one line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the alley corner reconfigured into sacred canvas, the gauge tooth retired with velveted cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored sweep layers density until the final cadence shift (“quiet strength”). Causality is internal but legible—because she persists, the space is re-lit and her body pays. No orientation debt; spatial anchors clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fire-escape micro-setting constrains every move: railing as pulpit, petal as timer, dumpster corner as target. Harbor moonlight is not postcard but tactical resource—its angle determines tactic success. Tool-as-setting (gauge tooth) evolves from lock-secret probe to sacramental wand. One tiny lapse: distance to alley brick never specified, forcing reader inference mid-sweep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reflect light into dark corners”—tightens through physical fatigue and the risk of being seen. One meaningful deepening: the sweep slows under shoulder ache, foreclosing longer ritual. Cost is visible on page (warm fatigue, thorn prick, velvet pouch). Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: neglected spaces and people retain latent luminescence. Final image reweights chalk sun, moss, lost button—ordinary debris now consecrated. No moralizing; the “quiet rebellion” is shown via tired shoulder and stowed mirror. Ambiguity persists: will Mateo carry the glow or will dawn erase it?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: maritime cadence, gardener idiom, lock-tech lexicon. Syntax lengthens and shortens with sweep rhythm; no head-hop. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon until one line (“sacred threshold”) that reads intentionally elevated. Voice propulsion carries the entire beat sequence without monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates like breathing; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are mixed but purposively—moonlight as oar-path, gauge tooth as sacrament—coherent under Accumulative lens. One scaffolding clause (“with unwavering motion”) could trim. Otherwise high density, zero artifacts in closure zone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ritualized light-casting via repurposed locksmith tool is fresh; rose-petal timer and harbor moon as rechargeable battery feel inevitable yet new. Risk: quiet lyric stakes could tip into sentimental, but fatigue and thorn undercut. Transformation test fails—names could change—but specificity of tool and tide keeps it memorable.</comment>
