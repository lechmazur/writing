<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s involuntary candor is dramatized under pressure; the micro-choice to hand over the lacquer box enacts both duty and grandfather-loyalty. Interior contradiction is legible: he dreads yet welcomes the coming reveal. Cost is felt when his private cathedral of wonder is exposed to bureaucratic eyes and must survive on poetry, not data. Trait governs every beat; no stock therapy-speak; final ember of satisfaction is concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from inciting blackout to Dr. Aris’s exit; each beat is linked via “because/therefore” (rumored error → diagnostic plea → riddle reveal). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s rules are quietly rewritten—poetry now trumps raw data, and future drones will carry that cost. Anchors (who/where/when) land by word 34; orientation never blurs. Cost is made undeniable in the final image—Kael’s silent vigil now carries the weight of a city’s redesigned gaze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tower’s obsidian lens re-enters as both mirror and trap, constraining the drones’ perception and Kael’s options—“cathedral of sky and science” is not garnish but leverage. Nectar dusk is not decorative; its amber wavelength literally shuts the system, making environment an antagonist. Micro-object status granted to lacquer box and matchbox; their handling alters the social choreography of reveal. Final star-scattered dark reprises dusk’s palette with stakes inverted—beauty now wields veto power over tech.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder inside routine—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when disclosure risks institutional flattening. Agency pivot: Kael elects poetic transfer via riddle, trading control for wonder’s survival; the cost is surrendering sole ownership of truth. Escalation comes via deepening, not external twists: each sentence of the riddle refracts the same sunset into larger implications until shutdown is re-valued as homage. Visible price: Dr. Aris carries away the lacquer box—Kael’s inherited authority physically leaves the tower, leaving him with only vigil and ember.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the riddle’s answer—technology blinded by beauty—without authorial commentary; the reader extracts the parable alongside Aris. Subtext operates in silence: Kael’s smile at the end is a tacit sanction of future redesigns that will bow to sky. No moral is stated; instead, the final image of diamond-dust stars reweights the blackout from failure to initiation. Nectar dusk motif returns transformed—no longer culprit but covenant—earning resonance rather than decoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael with perceptual signature: light is “liquid gold,” drones “dance,” data is “cold.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then clips short when Aris enters—“a sharp rap.” No head-hop; Dr. Aris’s awe is observed from outside, preserving distance. Compression in “Keeper, voice tight” teaches the reader to accept telegraphic speech under urgency. Final cadence—single clause ember—mirrors the steady glow of his candor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluid long sentences for dusk with staccato beats for intrusion; no template cadence. Information density high: lacquer box sentence delivers history, texture, heirloom status in 21 words. Metaphors stay coherent—nectar, cathedral, ember share warmth/sacred register. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; no filter-verb stacks. Final line lands on monosyllabic ember for sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses climate-tech with pastoral riddle—fresh synthesis rather than stock solarpunk. Drones misreading sunset as lightning surge is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Risk: stakes hinge on aesthetics-over-engineering; story commits fully, never retreating to technobabble. Specificity of “obsidian lens,” “amber wavelength,” and grandfather’s matchbox keeps concept rooted, not abstract. Could not swap tower for generic pylon without breaking causal logic.</comment>
