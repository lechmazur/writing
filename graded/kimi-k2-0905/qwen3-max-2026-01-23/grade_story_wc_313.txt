<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (“felt the absence of sound like a shift in atmospheric pressure”) and links grandmother memory to present choice. Micro-choice—wrapping bottle instead of cataloging—embodies “precisely humane,” but the emotional turn is slightly underplayed: throat-pang is named, not embodied in gesture or breath. Still, motivations track cleanly to the final promise, meeting the 9- test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: mirror-stars / ghost-streets reconfigure past from ghost to foundation with felt cost of bureaucratic risk. Causal chain holds: silence-cue → photo → descent → bottle rescue → tomorrow-school plan. One transition (bank down / climb up) is legible; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—authority directive—shapes tactics throughout. Meets 9- gate; only micro-slip is slight over-explication of purpose in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reservoir, algae-slick cobbles, and violet dusk are filtered through levee-warden priorities; each detail either guides footing or cues memory. Sapphire bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains the ethical choice. Spatial choreography is clean: path→bank→porch-stone→satchel. Final mirrored surface recharges earlier “mirrored hush,” integrating environment into closure image—satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue memory from erasure”—is signaled early and tightens when directive vs. humanity conflict materializes in the bottle beat. Agency narrows to single choice: remove-and-destroy vs. remove-and-elevate; selecting latter forecloses bureaucratic compliance and risks job penalty. Cost is legible in on-page risk awareness (“reservoir authority’s directive echoed coldly”). No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern (mirror, silence, bottle, stars) rather than statement: memory as living foundation, not nostalgic ghost. Final mirror-image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in “expunge” bureaucratese vs. Gran’s liqueur ritual layers collective vs. personal history. Ambiguity remains—will school board accept story?—inviting reflection while staying coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter: pressure-shift silence, algae-slick cobbles, scent of forgotten lives. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens on descent—“Her movements were economical, precise.” No head-hop; psychic distance modulates intentionally. Register remains consistent; only minor cadence repetition (“precisely humane” twice) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bone by bone due to an unrelenting drought” collapses decades into five words. Metaphors are selective and paid off—mirror, hush, compass. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph risks slight cadence overkill (“one rescued artifact, one remembered moment at a time”), but rhythm supports closure, not obscuring it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Flooded-town-resurfacing is familiar trope, but lens through levee-warden’s ethical cataloguing and photograph trail feels particular. Sapphire liqueur bottle as memory-key is fresh sensory hook. Risk of bureaucratic erasure gives timely edge without sermonizing. Could push further into singular voice or regional dialect for 9-band, but already above template level.</comment>
