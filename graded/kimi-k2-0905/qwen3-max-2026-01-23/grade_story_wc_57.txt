<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—patience is embodied in breath-ghosts and slow finger-work on rope, not declared. The final renunciation (“the seed was merely the vessel”) is earned because her earlier tactile decoding has already demonstrated reverence for method over relic. No contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair. Fisherman’s silence-as-trust supplies minimal but sufficient status shift to satisfy relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fulgurite’s weight against her heart reweights the entire quest from object to method, cost made legible in the final line. Causal chain holds—rope decoding → third piling → glass → insight—each because/therefore step tightening options. Orientation anchored by word 90 (“golden dock…snow”). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off in the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow-muffled dock, tarred hemp rope, and fog function as micro-setting that actively narrows sensory input and thus governs the slow tactile decoding. Third piling emerges as landmark only because knot language pointed there—setting directly enables the final discovery. Weathered wood hollow and oilcloth bundle are specific, lived-in objects handled on the page. Environment constrains the discovery beat; 9+ gate satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve method, not object—signaled in paragraph 4 and tested when she must choose to value the knot knowledge over mere possession. One meaningful tightening: diamond knot → Turk’s-head signals sacred trust, forcing her tacit vow to guard method. Cost is conceptual but legible: she leaves with lighter philosophical cargo yet heavier responsibility. Could use one tangible forfeiture (time, tool, social credit) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tactile ritual: knowledge encoded in rope displaces anthropocentric archive. Final image of lightning-glass as “tiny ark of memory” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in fisherman’s silent finger-to-brow salute—method passed, not explained. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity remains whether storm-oak will ever germinate, keeping resonance open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s sensory funnel: snow-crunch, hemp fibers, latent acorn gleam. Syntax lengthens and quiets to mimic patient loom-work, then contracts at the final pulse of glass. No head-hopping; fisherman’s interior accessed only through gesture. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “twisted root of smoky glass, frozen in the moment of its violent creation” does triple descriptor duty. Rhythm modulates naturally between long atmospheric sentences and tight single-clause beats. Only minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt understanding settle”)—doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; figurative language purpose-driven.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses meteorological lore, maritime knot-script, and seed-archiving into a fresh synthesis not seen in familiar templates. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic port, proving specificity matters. Risk taken in quiet accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image. One fresh inflection: lightning-forged glass as archive for botanical memory—violence birthing preservation.</comment>
