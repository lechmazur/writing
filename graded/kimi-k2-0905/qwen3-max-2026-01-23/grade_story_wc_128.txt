<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s shrewd-cargo-broker lens surfaces in the locket discovery beat, but interior contradiction is told (“motivation crystallized instantly”) rather than enacted. Elara remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is Liam-Elias; their status shift from strangers to co-conspirators is credible, yet Liam’s voice converges toward Elias’s diction under stress. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when Elias seals the note, accepting the risk of sentiment overtaking pragmatism, but the cost is asserted, not felt. Character bounds hold; no knowledge leaks, and the Earned Stasis renunciation (returning the locket before opening) is properly foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mis-addressed envelope → locket reveal → recognition → anonymous note plan; each beat narrows options under a single lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walks toward the harbor carrying the “first ripple,” a conceptual cost that reweights his transactional worldview. Persistent constraint—his newly chosen “logistics of the soul”—shapes the final image. One micro-turn (Liam’s arrival) complicates without resolving; no coincidence solves the problem.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective: salt-kissed breeze, wrought-iron stands, weathered bench—each filtered through Elias’s cargo-trained eye for detail. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track across the single scene. The garden’s star-dusted canopy mirrors the interior shift but stops short of constraining the final choice, so the 9+ gate is missed. Proper-noun economy is tight; no anachronisms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplift Elara—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decides on the anonymous note, foreclosing his default anonymity. Pressure grows because exposure (even anonymous) threatens his hard-won professional detachment; the price is conceptual but legible. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elias swaps “moving cargo” for “moving hearts.” No external antagonist is needed; internal resistance supplies sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges through Elara’s locket, the outdated address, and the final sealed envelope—no moralizing lecture required. Subtext operates in Liam’s tears under starlight: gratitude for being “truly seen.” Final image of the harbor at dawn reconfigures Elias’s transactional life without stating a thesis. cycles of compassion is named once; the concept is shown via the note chain, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—“whimsically attentive gaze honed spotting forged bills of lading”—is consistent and character-specific. Syntax loosens slightly under emotion (“cautious exuberance warmed his chest”) without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Liam’s “Sentiment overruled sense” carries subtext. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense: “Respecting privacy, Elias did not open it, but a delicate locket had slipped free” performs three jobs in one line. One paraphrase loop appears—“silent contributor” is repeated three times in close proximity—triggering a −0.3 artifact penalty. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscures causality. Final line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “broker redeems invisible stagehands” angle feels fresh, grounded in maritime-cargo specifics rather than generic kindness. The mistaken-address trope is revitalized by tying it to a razed seaside street and a locket photo of the off-stage heroine. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure instead of dramatic confrontation—and coherence holds. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on Elias’s cargo-trained eye and the harbor setting.</comment>
