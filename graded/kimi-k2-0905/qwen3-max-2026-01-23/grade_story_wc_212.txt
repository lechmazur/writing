<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive to “feel borrowed time” is explicit and governs every beat; her minute seed placements and the final tear embody embodied, contradictory emotion. The interiority is lyrically filtered yet stays particular to a seed-saver’s gaze. Only minor shortfall: no interior flaw or misbelief complicates her flawless execution, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is crisp: egg vanishes → must reopen vortex → entropy-decrease ritual → tactile revelation → covenant sealed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single melting drop tolls spring into being, cost paid by her irrevocable sensory knowledge. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleporting objects or lore dumps. Holds Accumulative/Textural lens to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is not backdrop—its geometry funnels starlight into the ritual circle and its melting ice supplies the first water of the new season. Micro-setting (acorn cap, gloves, pouch) constrains hand movements that must be perfect. Select sensory triangulation—“geometric patterns of liquid light”—keeps exposition zero. Only nit: temperature gradient described but never limits body or breath endurance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she feel borrowed time or fail?”—tightens once via the entropy ritual; failure means eternal sterile winter. Agency is pure: every seed placed decreases options until the final petal proves success. Cost is knowledge that spring is now her perpetual debt. No secondary pressure or antagonist, but at this length one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of temporal covenant emerges through tactile images (river-stone certainty, bark hope) rather than lecture. The reprise of the melting drop reframes winter from tomb to cradle without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: she gains power but inherits unending obligation. Final image reweights all prior cold into generative promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains lyric compression—“furiously tranquil focus”—that mirrors ritual breath. Syntax lengthens then shortens with the chant’s cadence; no filler verbs. Perceptual signature botanically precise: “miniature scales gleaming like polished jet.” No head-hop or register drift; experimental entropy grammar is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often slots seed, myth, and motion. Rhythm modulates from frost-crack consonants to liquid sibilants as ice melts. Figurative layer is thick but each metaphor serves closure (starlight lens → vortex). Only minor loop: “frozen” repeats four times in one paragraph; does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Seed-saving entropy ritual feels novel yet inevitable; cosmology is implied, not catalogued. Fusion of astrophysics and horticulture yields fresh metaphoric space. Risk taken with near-pure lyric causality pays off. Could edge higher if personal stakes risked more than cosmic beauty.</comment>
