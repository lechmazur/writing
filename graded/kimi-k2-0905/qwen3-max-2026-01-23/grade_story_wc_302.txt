<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for silence vs. need to speak—is dramatized in the final apology. The watch-driven micro-choices (timing transcriptions, anticipating word-flickers) tether motive to action. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of permanent silence. Voice remains individual; no stock “dreamer” tropes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each delayed word adds weight until the silence becomes unbearable, forcing the apology. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her spoken word rewrites the library’s rule-set; shelves glow in confirmation. Cost is felt: once she speaks, the letter’s verdict can no longer be ignored. Pattern taught early, paid off at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crystalline-spire library, counter-clockwise watch, and gossamer veil are handled, not catalogued. The backward-ticking watch literally lets her predict page-shifts, constraining tactics. Mist and glowing shelves charge the final spoken word. Spatial grounding remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: seize ephemeral words before they vanish. Propagation delay tightens twice: first as transcription race, then as emotional heat on skin. The 3-second flicker forecloses perfect record—she must speak or lose everything. Cost is visible: mist stills when she chooses voice over safe silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversed grammar (“I forgive you” → “you forgive I”) that questions agency of absolution. Final spoken word reweights earlier silence without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; insight is earned through tactile struggle with vanishing text. Ambiguity lingers: will the letter destroy this peace?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, slightly archaic diction fits scholar-dreamer POV; perceptual signature notices syntax shifts before visual ones. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short clauses during 3-second vanishings, longer cadences during mist-still reverence. No head-hopping; interior access stays consistent. Filter verbs serve voice (“words propagated delays of warmth across her skin”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence either transcribes, anticipates, or embodies the reversed-time rule. Figurative language stays physical (“words… flickering into existence after a breath-held pause”). Opening and closing lines book-end the reversal motif. No register drift; diction remains within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Reversed-time图书馆 where grammar itself is unstable feels fresh yet inevitable. Watch’s backward tick is not gimmick—its constraint shapes every tactical choice. Apology-as-virus that rewrites the library’s rule-set is earned, not bolted on. Transformation test passes: swap any device and the logic collapses.</comment>
