<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—craving open sky while clutching a bunker relic—are dramatized in the weightless release of the doll. Micro-choice to nest the doll in the new sprout shows value hierarchy shift; cost is the surrender of talismanic fear. Interior voice stays concrete, filtering silence through palate and skin. Slight over-articulation of “claustrophobia dissolved like mist” nudges down from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: gravity reasserts, doll hums with stored quiet, sprout roots skyward—visible cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within 50 words. Causality intact: inversion hour → release → seed sprout → mantra. No late rule changes; silence texture is foreshadowed, not retro-fitted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Xenial trellis functions as micro-setting that alters tactics—its living lattice both permits weightlessness and houses the seed. Selective sensory triad: starlight blossoms’ hum, honeyed-light taste, ozone scent. Spatial choreography clean; body lifts, doll drifts, seed spirals. Cloud-ladder descent anchors vertical axis, preventing white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture boundless peace to counter dread”—tightens when gravity inversion offers one-hour window. Agency: she limits sensory input to become “pure vessel,” then releases doll to seal conversion. Cost legible: surrender of fear-talisman; persistent constraint of future dread remains, now re-weighted. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via inversion imagery: bunker silence contracts, sky silence expands. Doll’s re-purposing from confinement token to gratitude offering reconfigures legacy without moralizing. Final mantra “courage grows in any direction” crystallizes from concrete vine image. Subtext avoids thesis statement; meaning arises through tactile silence flavors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “phantom pressure on ribs,” “taste of honeyed light.” Syntax lengthens during weightless passage, contracts on return—rhythm mirrors gravity shift. No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Diction stays within poetic but plausible register; one near-purple phrase “luminous presence felt intangibly tangible” is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver sensory, emotional, and world data. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence. One paraphrase loop—“silence with texture, weight…intangibly tangible”—is purposeful motif reinforcement, not scaffold. Minor nominalization “reconfiguration” tolerated in closure line where cadence demands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of bunker legacy with anti-gravity botany feels inevitable yet unseen before. Silence as edible, weighted substance flips familiar trope into sensory stakes. Inversion hour and xenial trellis are not gimmicks; they force character transformation. Risk in lyric compression pays off: final image of root-reaching-sky crystallizes thematic inversion.</comment>
