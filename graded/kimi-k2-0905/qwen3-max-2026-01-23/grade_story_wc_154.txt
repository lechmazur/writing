<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anahera’s contradictory impulses—war-honed vigilance versus tender, almost child-like openness—are dramatized in the micro-gesture of whispering to a sleeping boy while re-parenting her own past self. Every tactile choice (thumb on coral, breath catching, placing the fossil beside the cast) externalizes an internal hierarchy of values: translate pain first, self-second. The final renunciation—silence turned into spoken reassurance—carries a felt cost: she forfeits the protective numbness she carried since the refugee tent. Interiority stays embodied; no diagnostic labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the coral placed beside the cast reweights all prior smudges into “wounds can hold beauty,” with undeniable conceptual cost—she can no longer treat her own scars as dead tissue. Causality holds: because she decrypts Leo’s dread, she can finally voice the answer she once withheld from the Tok Pisin boy, retroactively healing that memory. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each deciphered mark thickens emotional density until the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sterile, mist-clad atrium”), well inside the 120-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brain-coral fragment functions as micro-setting: its warming in her palm constrains her decision to speak aloud, charging the final image. Mist-twilight through glass is filtered through her Pacific-bred eye for shifting water-color, never tourist postcard. Body-as-setting is precise: the cast’s “smudged crayon notes” map emotional terrain she must physically trace. Spatial choreography is clean—coral moves from hand to bedside in one unbroken motion that locks the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she convert shared dread into mutual safety—signals early and tightens with each decoded smudge. Mid-story “Will the dark stay forever?” forces her to decide whether to speak the answer she once dodged; this narrows her options from silent observer to vocal protector. Cost is visible: she pays with the armor of detachment she has worn since the camp. Escalation is textural—density of deciphered symbols increases until refusal to speak becomes impossible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of translation: fear → symbol → spoken word → shared strength. No character articulates a thesis; the coral’s final placement silently re-prices the premise that wounds must remain ugly. Subtext lives in gesture—her thumb mirroring the coral’s whorls mirrors the boy’s spiral of dread. The ending image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: beauty can root in injury without moralizing the claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “twilight bled through the glass ceiling” stays within a translator’s sensory lexicon. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into whispered anaphora (“You are safe. You are loved.”) to mimic breath control under stress. No head-hopping; perception remains strictly Anahera’s. Dialogue is absent by design, so evaluation collapses into interior monologue that sustains distinct rhythm and diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “The jagged black line was not a weapon; it was the shadow of the operating room door” advances knowledge, re-casts symbol, and releases tension in one beat. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. Filter verbs appear only when motivated by interpretive distance (“she saw it instantly”). Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting clause length mimic exhalation. One mixed-metor risk—“watercolor haze of indigo and pearl”—reads as POV-appropriate synesthesia and does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses two rarely paired arenas—Pacific conflict-zone trauma and pediatric hospital atrium—through the universal act of reading a child’s frightened doodles. The coral-as-interpretive-key is non-obvious yet inevitable once deployed. Risk is taken by omitting dialogue and external antagonist, relying on textural accrual; the gamble pays off in a closure image that could not exist without this exact object. No derivative template is visible; lived detail prevents swapability.</comment>
