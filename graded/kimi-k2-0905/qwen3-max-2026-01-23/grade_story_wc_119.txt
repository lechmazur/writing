<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas’s regret-to-reconciliation arc is anchored in tactile ritual (gull-counting, stone-keeping) and a visible micro-choice to speak the apology aloud; the moment he presses the stone back into her palm crystallizes earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“breath catching,” “tears blurred”) rather than diagnostic. Daughter Elara functions as crucible: her single line forces Silas’s renunciation of covert manipulation, sealing the duet. No contradiction or label-speak harms the pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he hides truth in cookies → ferry carries cookie → Elara reads → returns; his final spoken apology is the decisive change that forecloses the old path of secrecy. Closure carries unmistakable cost—he abandons the microdot method and the twenty-year silence, felt in the handshake and the tide’s rhythm shift. Lighthouse and cookie mechanics are taught early and paid off; no teleporting props. Orientation anchor (“after last orders”) is clear by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Graystone Lighthouse, iron spiral, salt-stained study, and gull-counting cliff constrain every move: isolation dictates cookie smuggling, dawn ferry sets clock, lantern room gives vantage for skiff arrival. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Silas notices tide whispers before rose-gold horizon, not tourist catalog. The smooth stone re-enters as charged micro-setting that physically bridges past and present in the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will spoken apology replace encoded silence?—is signaled in beat 3. One meaningful tightening: the moment Elara steps onto gravel holding only the wrapper, Silas realizes the microdot is superfluous, narrowing his options to raw honesty. Cost is visible: he abandons covert craft and twenty-year defense, crystallized in handshake. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—“open secrets need no cipher, only courage”—emerges from the failure of the microdot plan and the success of the spoken apology, not from authorial statement. Stone, gull count, and lighthouse shift from isolating ritual to shared memory without overt symbolism. Final image of tide carrying “old solitude away” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. No sermonizing or thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas with perceptual signature—maritime lexicon, lamp-room vantage, salt-stained textures. Diction (“granite teeth,” “rose-gold light”) is anchored to seafarer POV without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for pacing lantern room, staccato rush down spiral when skiff appears. No head-hopping; Elara’s interior accessed only through her single spoken line—indirection maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “pressing the cookie dough, sealing wrapper, pacing lantern room” compresses three actions into one beat. Metaphors are coherent—lighthouse as “granite teeth” fits maritime peril, microdot as “brittle relic” bridges spy past to present. Final line’s “steady rhythm of two hearts learning a new melody” avoids cliché by tying back to musical transposition motif established early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fortune-cookie writer as clandestine reconciler is fresh; trope is inverted—prophecies work only when abandoned for plain speech. Microdot repurposed for filial love rather than espionage offers specific transformation. Stone-as-memory and gull-counting ritual are particular to this pair, not generic reconciliation props. Risk of sentimentality is taken but paid off by silence preceding the single whispered apology. No derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
