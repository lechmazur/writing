<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s vow is stated early and his micro-choices (scattering pods, pouring water) flow from it, but interiority lapses into abstract paraphrase (“he had not come to erase…”) rather than embodied contradiction; no second impulse presses against the garden vow, so the arc is linear, not crucible. The smile at the end feels unearned because the text never lets him question or risk anything tangible—no lost time, no bodily cost, no trade-off visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green thread reweights the submerged-concord motif with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: each bird translation adds density rather than causal turns, and the final image crystallizes the stake without contradiction. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props or logic breaks. The price is felt conceptually, but not dramatized as a forfeiture Kael must bear, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jetty, tide, and cracked plank are tactile and guide Kael’s kneeling, watering, and final glance; the cold grit in his fingers anchors the battlefield memory. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but salt smell and groaning planks under knees keep it lived-in. The faint green thread at the end is micro-setting that charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. No spatial drift or weather inconsistency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden as amendment to broken peace—is signaled early and deepens through each bird injunction; pressure is accumulative, not causal, and narrows to the final watering. No external opposition or internal counter-want, so escalation is a cadence shift rather than option foreclosure. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, limiting entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the seed-to-concord equation; the nightingale’s return reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in the birds’ commands, not in character silence, sustaining complexity. Final image avoids thesis statement, offering resonant reconfiguration. No platitudes or thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptions; diction (“gnarled hands,” “salt has receded”) carries weather-worn specificity. Syntax lengthens under lyric pressure but remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct enough to lift the piece above generic elegy, though occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual cost”) nudges register slightly beyond coachman lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long hortatory sentences to the staccato bird translations, propelling the accumulative arc. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“ivy over stone”). One mixed vehicle (“ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling”) is minor. No artifacts touch the closure beat; density remains high without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Peace-as-seed buried in a drowned treaty is fresh; using bird translations as agricultural instructions converts ornithology into ritual without gimmickry. The concord-garden synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight and charges the final image. Risk in the lyric, accumulative structure pays off; no close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
