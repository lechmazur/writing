<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-soaked need to recover “lost” birth-hours fuels every beat; the interiority stays concrete and embodied (“ink on her skin drink the starlight”). Yet the arc is interior surrender, not choice, so the final unfastening feels pre-ordained rather than paid for by a visible, forfeited alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the crack is re-valued from breach to vessel (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost—she forsakes control. Accumulative lens holds; each image (traced hand, cracked saucer) layers until the final tear re-weights them. One soft causality gap: how the saucer-crack physically “pinged” at the birth is asserted, not sourced, but it doesn’t rupture the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glade’s thin air and luminous fungi act as micro-setting that literally constricts breath, mirroring her anxiety; the altitude becomes the final cleansing inhale. Spatial anchors are immediate and POV-filtered. The saucer itself serves as portable “setting” that constrains her ritual gestures, qualifying for the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve stolen time—tightens once: the realization that fractures are vessels, not voids. No external antagonist, but the pressure of thin air and maternal guilt coheres under situational lens. Price is legible (she gives up the need for certainty), yet escalation is a single deepening rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—time accrues in broken places—emerges solely through concrete re-envisioning of the saucer and tracings; no authorial thesis is spoken. The final image of “a seam of light” re-weights every prior mention without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the crack is both wound and womb, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly moored to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight “bleeds,” ink “drinks.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath-deprivation, producing a rhythmic signature. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; elliptical compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional purple flourish (“choking beauty” twice) risks poetic overload but stays tethered to POV. One paraphrase loop: “willingly perplexed” idea is restated three times in close succession, dulling edge slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing cartomancy with post-partum regret through a cracked doll saucer is fresh, resisting stock mysticism. The risk of lyric excess is mostly controlled; the concept never retreats into safety. Still, the birth-hour theft premise flirts with abstract sentiment—saved by tactile payoff in the final thumbprint.</comment>
