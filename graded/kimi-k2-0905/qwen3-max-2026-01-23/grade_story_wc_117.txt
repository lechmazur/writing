<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “quiet vow” is dramatized through the micro-choice of mirroring Liam’s breath and surrendering the curl. The moment she places the curl in his palm crystallizes a contradictory impulse: relinquish the anchor to gain the link. Liam’s shift from dust-staring to tear-tracked awe is rendered through visible bodily change, not label-speak. Cost is legible: she permanently shares her private relic, foreclosing sole possession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the curl passed back “The link is real” reweights both relic and sky under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold. One meaningful tightening—the eclipse hush compresses attention to the shared object—suffices. Persistent constraint: the curl’s absence from her pocket afterward signals ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Heartwood Oak’s root-cradle constrains seating and focalizes attention; the eclipse cools air and silences birds, forcing whisper-level intimacy. Sage scent is filtered through Elara’s therapeutic bias for “clarity.” Spatial choreography is clean: guitar case, pouch, boy’s sneakers all track. The curl operates as micro-setting that final image charges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindling Liam’s wonder—surfaces early. Pressure escalates via sensory deepening: daylight dims, birds quit, guitar softens, curl transfers. The eclipse is situational pressure, not coincidence; it crystallizes stance rather than solving externals. Visible price: Elara loses exclusive custody of her relic; Liam risks awe in front of a stranger—both costs on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—ordinary magic as attentive presence—emerges through gesture, not thesis: curl ↔ eclipse, web ↔ stars. Subtext lives in silence and object exchange; no character moralizes. Final image of dew-jeweled spiderweb reweights earlier “ordinary” into cosmic scale without statement. Ambiguity remains: wonder is fragile, yet now portable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual chord: “hands that spoke in gentle chords,” scent as “promise,” strum mirroring breath. Syntax lengthens and softens under eclipse hush; diction stays within her mellow lexicon. No head-hop; Liam’s interior accessed only via body and speech. Rhythm modulates with scene breath—long sentences for sway, fragments for awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: cadence slows during eclipse, accelerates after flare. Each sentence carries dual duty—e.g., “Coolness rose from the dreaming roots” advances atmosphere and stakes chill. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“poured,” “pricked,” “flares”—replace modifiers. Only hairline slip: “ordinary magic” repeated four times; still pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—music therapist uses relic + eclipse to reboot a child’s wonder—risks twee, but grounding in tactile detail (curl weight, root texture) and refusal of spectacle keeps it fresh. Synthesis of astronomy, memory, and therapy feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No close echoes; spiderweb star-chat avoids cliché. Risk: soft adaptation could read as passive; countered by concrete surrender of curl.</comment>
