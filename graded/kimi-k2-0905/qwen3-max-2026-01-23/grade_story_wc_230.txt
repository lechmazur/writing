<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crystal-clear and her involuntary truthfulness is dramatized at the checkpoint, not just asserted. The internal contradiction—she must succeed yet cannot lie—drives every micro-choice from footfall to truffle wrap. The sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t apply, but the antique eye as love-token reweights the final image. No stock therapy-speak; dread and hope are embodied in rain-slick stone and moss-lined silk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm → truffle → ritual → possible safety. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses retreat—”this was necessary”—with the glass eye’s warm pressure against her ribs as visible cost. One smooth ascent, no teleporting props; the textbook rumor is set-up, not last-minute patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is not backdrop but obstacle course: slick stones, splintered limbs, lightning scar dictate where knees bend and fingers dig. Micro-setting beats (root, moss, oilcloth) constrain wrapping ritual and echo fractured grace. Sensory hierarchy is forager-specific: scent of damp earth before blossom visual. Final image reuses ridge view to crystallize cost—orchard endurance mirrors sister’s psyche—charging closure under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivate safety for Lena—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens once: the checkpoint forces blunt honesty that could have seized the relic; success narrows future options to ritual attempt. Cost is legible: permanent visibility of smuggling risk, possible ritual failure. No coincidence; storm complicates but also enables truffle formation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery, not statement: fractured grace appears first in orchard, last in “act of fractured grace,” now reweighted as love’s necessary violence. Subtextual irony—truthfulness abets smuggling—deepens moral texture. No sermonizing; final line offers image-flame, not moral. Empathy virus premise stays conceptual background, letting human gesture carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature: “quiet precision of a rational truffle forager” colors every noticing. Prose modulates from lyrical orchard catalog to compressed ritual checklist, mirroring shift from open search to closed procedure. No head-hopping; antique eye’s “knowing light” is focalized through her superstition, not objective fact. Rhythm accelerates uphill, sentences shortening as breath tightens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence can layer storm damage, metaphor, and emotional analogue. Figurative control: “rational truffle forager” is fresh, not strained; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge, tool state, or emotional charge. Opening and final lines frame voice and stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-pandemic empathy damage with mycological folk medicine—fresh synthesis. Truffle-as-psychotropic + antique eye occlusion is specific enough to feel inevitable, not gimmick. “Fractured grace” as tonal through-line transforms storm wreckage into moral stance. Risk taken: discredited science accepted without apology, earning conceptual repricing at close.</comment>
