<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—map-maker who disowns maps—drives every beat; the atlas-editor profession filters every perception, from frost-feather cipher to river-source obsession. Motivation stays concrete: “rebellion against atlases that mapped symptoms while ignoring origins” (37) and crystallizes into tomorrow’s drill. Micro-choices—thumb to dog-ear, palm to vibrating glass—embody stakes without label-speak. The falcon rapport supplies external pressure, but secondary-character headcount stays safe; cost is felt in the unspoken forfeiture of her former life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—condensation, phrasebook, falcon flight—and lands a Charged Poise closure: “some truths require only stillness to be heralded” (252). Causality is interior but legible: each pattern increment (frost, phrase, bird-log) tightens the convergence until stance crystallizes. Cost is palpable: professional identity abandoned, cold dawn vigil assumed. No orientation debt; anchoring occurs by word 27 (“rusted outpost’s splintered floorboards”) and re-anchors at each shard break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frost-rimed planks, corroded beam, peat-stove crackle—every surface is handled, not catalogued. The frozen lake shifts from “worrying tranquility” to “latent power,” mirroring Elara’s cognitive shift. The dog-eared phrasebook functions as micro-setting: its softened cover is fingered twice, constraining the next move. Environmental cold is not backdrop but tactical clock—sun angle will cast the decisive shadow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where the rivers begin”—is signaled in sentence two and escalates through each deciphered pattern. The final tightening arrives when interior warmth erases the literal map, forcing decision: drill tomorrow or abandon quest. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and atmospheric. Cost is conceptual but visible: she forfeits the safety of “settled science” and embraces convergence beneath ice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the refrain of origins vs. representations: atlases lie, condensation tells. The closing image reweights every prior annotation—her future footnote will be a single, quiet correction, not a manifesto. Subtext resides in silence: the falcon’s chirp, the stove’s crackle, the lake’s hum—negotiations with an indifferent universe. No moralizing; complexity is honored: truth is a meeting, not a monument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakably cartographic—marginalia metaphors, delta vs. nexus, “bold cartographic correction” (79). Syntax stays crisp, dry, Latinate—“crystalline ice dust,” “polyglot’s phrasebook”—mirroring an editor trained to distill. Rhythm modulates: longer clause chains for reflection, staccato for discovery. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent—she reads frost the way she once read borders.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries double duty: “condensation on the glass, a language written in droplets and frost-feathers” (58) fuses sensory detail with conceptual map. No loops or scaffold; clauses tighten under pressure. Figurative control: ice dust, rust, peat smoke form coherent palette without purple drift. Final line earns cadence release after controlled build.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: treat a frost pattern as living map, river source as atmospheric convergence, atlases as lies. These turns feel inevitable once taught; no late rule changes. Risk—quiet lyric ending in a genre that often demands spectacle—pays off by reconfiguring stakes from global to glacially personal. Specificity of Andean-Sumerian cross-reference prevents generic “ancient wisdom” trap.</comment>
