<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s calm urgency and the shift from Lyra’s doubt to “oriented” conviction ring true; embodied micro-choices are mostly missing, conveyed instead through summary and Lyra’s posture. Motivation is consistent but never complicates; no interior contradiction or visible cost under pressure. Characterization feels slightly elevated-by-proxy rather than individually pitted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “I feel oriented” crystalizes conceptual cost and reweights the link. Orientation anchors by word 60; causality accumulates under a taught geometric-mapping motif that deepens through the scanner demonstration; lens holds to the end. One transition (none required) is smooth. Minor slack: off-page Lumin supply the rulebook, so the final legitimacy rides on an external given.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystalflex viewport, bioluminescent arteries, and micro-setting within the spire are vivid and filtered through Kael’s priorities. The anchor chain link functions as micro-setting; its weight and angles constrain the geometry lesson and enter the final image. Deep-city pressure is implied not tactile; no environmental obstruction alters the moment—a hairline gap before 9 band allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can we map stars from here?”—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when scanning the link aligns the Dubhe-Merak angle; before/after options reconfigure, but no concrete obstacle or price is risked; doubt dissolves without residual cost. Escalation is conceptual, not tactical, sufficient at length but short of impact required for ≥8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—reclaiming orientation after cataclysm—emerges through the link’s re-purposing and Lyra’s stance shift, avoiding explicit sermon until the final aphoristic murmur which borders thematic echo. Subtext in hush and gesture (students’ whispers) lands. Resonance is durable yet slightly dampened by repeated abstractions: “unfolded horizons” thrice-named.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Kael stays consistent; perceptual signature favors metallurgical and astral diction that suits an instructor. Rhythm modulates between oratory cadence (“Today, we undertake...”) and compressed sensory note (“scarred fingers traced”). No dialogue to test subtext; minor register creep (“cognitive expansion”) momentarily lifts above Kael’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is tactile and propulsive; sentences open variably, most do double duty. Occasional formula triads (“memory, iron, and hope”) and near-repetitive “horizons unfolded” phrase count as micro-loops but do not stall closure. Mixed metaphors absent; clarity preserved. One filter stack (“Kael felt...”) is minor; no artifacts intrude on the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Geometry-aided astral navigation taught via scrap anchor is fresh; surface drowned + abyssal city + alien Lumin synthesize into a singular mythic layer. Transformation satisfies proximity test—swapping any prop or motive would collapse lesson logic. Risk in compressed lyric exposition pays off in final “oriented” beat. A hair’s breadth from 9+: would need one unforeseen resistance or cost to fully ignite.</comment>
