<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—rootlessness vs. hunger for belonging—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of release-by-wind is earned through the shared search with Kael. The “boldly sympathetic” trait manifests as on-page risk (offering partnership, kneeling to dedicate). Only minor slip: Kael’s fifty-year backstory is told, not dramatized, slightly thinning pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (reed-stained hands, chimes, arbor against obsidian) deepens the stake of belonging until the dedication reweights solitude into kinship. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the graft has taken root”—with felt cost (permanent reed stain, Kael’s tear). One causal micro-gap: Echo’s tag is found by luck, not tactic, but coincidence merely reveals, not resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but constraint: the crystalline orchard’s chimes echo Elara’s ache, the crater’s pulse times heartbeat, the obsidian arbor physically receives the reed offering. Micro-setting (reed arbor vs. volcanic glass) charges the final image. Only hairline slip: crater geography sketched once, never limits movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens once: from solitary release to collective dedication. Agency visible when Elara chooses to place, not surrender, her sculpture. Cost legible in irrevocable offering and Kael’s dissolved solitude. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges through the act of seeking together, never sermonized. Final chord reconfigures “luminescent ache” from isolation to connection. Subtext in Kael’s tear and hand-cover carries more than dialogue could. Avoids tidy moral; ache remains, now shared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person adheres to Elara’s perceptual bias—green-stained hands, harmonic branches—without purple excess. Syntax modulates: long breathless cadence for awe, abrupt “She knelt” for climax. No head-hop; Kael’s interior accessed only through Elara’s sympathetic inference. Dialogue sparse, rough, age-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Figurative language dense but patterned (light/roots/chimes) and paid off in final chord. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds pressure or sensory precision. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent ache”) justified by lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Merges solarpastoral hope with street-art pilgrimage—fresh synthesis. Reed-into-obsidian offering feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in quiet climax pays off through Charged Poise. Could swap crater for any sublime vista, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
