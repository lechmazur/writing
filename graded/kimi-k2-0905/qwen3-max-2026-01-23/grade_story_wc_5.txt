<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s desire tofix heartbeat into map is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical tag-lines (“antithesis of her craft”) that tell rather than dramatize contradiction. She makes only one true micro-choice—offering the blood-drop—so the arc feels more ritual than tested character under pressure. The single bud swelling supplies external proof, yet no internal cost or contradiction is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern-building beats tighten toward the starlight bloom, and the closure image (living map folded to chest, bud swelling) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—orchard and alchemist both changed. Orientation is swift; crater/orchard/star window anchored by word 50, causal chain unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard is concrete—bleached twigs, violet twilight, frozen earth—each detail filtered through Elara’s salvage bias. The engraved plate’s copper chill and the single warming bud act as micro-settings that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bind cosmic light to living pulse—signaled early; pressure escalates as mis-alignment risks “terrifying void” of flash-paper ash. The final sealing narrows options: map gained, vigil ended, cold’s bite recedes—cost legible but emotionally faint, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of permanence-versus-vanishing emerges through action: flash-paper that refuses to burn, starlight made root. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though some phrasing (“beautiful vanishing”) flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s cadence—measured clauses, archaic diction (“zenith,” “heartwood”), syntax lengthening to mimic ritual. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Occasional elevated register (“luminous cartography”) nudges toward writerly but remains voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and information-dense clauses; a few stacked epithets (“skeletal testament… violet twilight”) slightly congest the opening beat. No looped stems, metaphors coherent, propulsion clean through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of alchemic craft with astro-botanical cartography feels fresh; trope of dying orchard revived by cosmic graft is specific to this voice. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but payoff justifies gamble. Could swap crater for other isolated biomes, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
