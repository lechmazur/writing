<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior discipline and generational duty feel lived-in; the tactile memory of the rake handle and the pendulum push reveal a believable hierarchy of values. However, the pendulum-vision grants her an almost perfect moral clarity that slightly flattens the cost of her final choice—no lingering doubt or new burden is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored tick re-anchors the village and her own moral ledger. Causality holds—grit causes silence, cleaning restores beat—but the pendulum’s metaphysical pause is a gentle coincidence rather than a tightening of options, so escalation is modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, brass gears, and salt-worn rake handle are sensuously specific and constrain every move she makes; the tower’s height and grit literally impede her goal. Micro-setting (rake as family conscience) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—temporal and moral order—remains coherent; removing grit is a single, meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of leaving the past un-mended. Cost is present but gentle: her inscription adds one more obligation to an already burdened lineage, not a new sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absolution-as-tide emerges through recurring tactile images rather than assertion; the closing image of the gull tracing the pendulum arc reweights every prior inscription into living motion. No moral is stated—balance is felt as ongoing pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s precise, salt-seasoned perception; cadence modulates with stair-climb breath and pendulum hush. No head-hop or register drift; occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is kept outside the narration itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, propelling ascent and descent; metaphor is restrained to volcanic grit, brass, and tide. No loops or mixed vehicles; the final “gull traced the pendulum’s arc” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combining clock-winding with generational atonement via micro-carvings on a gardening tool feels fresh and specific; the premise could not swap settings without collapse. Risk is quiet—no structural gimmicks—yet the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
