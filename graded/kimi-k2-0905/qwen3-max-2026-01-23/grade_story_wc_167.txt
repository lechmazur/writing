<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “gentle rebellion” motive drives every beat. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene, so the arc is lyrical rather than dramatic, but the final covenant feels earned. Micro-choices (stone toss, kneeling, turning toward harbor) are present and character-specific. Missing visible flaw or cost keeps it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: stone-toss → expanding rings → prism ignition → covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise: options re-weighted (“every fitted pane an act of communion”) with felt cost of perpetual vigilance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One tightening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay dawn is rendered through glazier’s eye—salt-fog, wet cobbles, obsidian pond—each detail filtered by vocational bias. Prism atrium evolves from “veiled decoration” to “radiant beacon,” constraining the final promise. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Tool (flat grey stone) functions as micro-setting that charges the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she extract meaning from mundane transience?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density: each ring stanza deepens the text until spectral light fuses with water. No external antagonist or reversal, but accumulative tightening forecloses passive spectatorship; cost is the lifelong covenant of attentive labor. Sufficient for lyric mode at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—value blooms in attentive ephemerality—emerges through concrete aqueous script rather than assertion. Final image reframes earlier cracked porthole as “story of resilience,” a non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (daily magic must be re-won). Resonance is built from particulars, not platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly welded to Elara’s perceptual signature—light fractured by vocation, salt tasted as “familiar companion.” Syntax flows from long contemplative coils to short crescendo clauses mirroring widening rings. No head-hopping; diction stays within glazier’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with dawn ignition without losing control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description, metaphor, and emotional register in one breath. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned (rings = stanzas) and paid off. Filter verbs are voice-motivated. Minor elevation in “noctilucent reckonings” is earned by repetition and closure charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Harbor-glazier reading transience in pond rings is fresh; prism atrium as secular reliquary reframes pedestrian trope. Ritual stone-toss transformed into textural epistemology. Risk lies in lyrical stillness rather than plot twist, but coherence justifies it. Could not swap setting or vocation without collapsing the arc.</comment>
