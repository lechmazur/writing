<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s vocation as “teacher of silence” is fully embodied—every micro-gesture (lifting the vial, calibrating her murmur) externalizes her intent. Leo’s grief is rendered through bodily tension that visibly softens; neither character slips into therapeutic exposition. The final beat earns its hush: Leo’s “quiet feels like her now” crystallizes a cost (his lifelong memory now re-coded), satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned change. Cap at 8.7 only because Leo’s interior paradoxes remain secondary; his shift is credible but not yet knotted with contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “noise → monitored silence → re-weighted stillness” taught by 15% mark and held to the last line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the perfectly clear vial plus Leo’s steady whisper reconfigure the meaning of quiet forever; cost is the irreversible substitution of grandmother-absence with terrace-silence. No orientation debt; geography and chronology stay anchored across the single continuous scene. Meets 9+ gate: persistent constraint (storm-glass chemistry) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Drifting prism terrace” is never mere décor—its refracted light physically bathes the deck, guiding Leo’s eye and calming his breath. The storm-glass vial functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara’s steering decisions beat-to-beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Leo hears heartbeat first, then terrace chimes; Elara notices chemical clarity before aesthetics. Touchable detail (willow-wood tiller, brass cradle) keeps spatial choreography clean; no 9.0 only because weather/air currents could have tightened one more tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“Will Leo accept stillness or stay trapped in noise-denial?”—tightens once, when the sky-lark note converts absence into presence. Escalation is textural: crystalline formations clear, heartbeats synchronize; the tightening is legible and irreversible. Agency is chiefly Elara’s calibrated guidance, yet the cost (grief now fused with silence) lands on Leo, satisfying lens requirements. Falls short of 8.8 because no secondary option is explicitly foreclosed; the win feels inevitable rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as void but as active, relational space. Storm-glass clarity and prism refractions reweight the idea across beats without authorial thesis. Final image of “vast, gentle hand” offers non-literal, resonant answer—comfort re-defined as spaciousness. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will silence suffice tomorrow?), giving the piece thematic legs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s sensorium (fluidly logical precision, calibrated ripple voice) without leakage. Lyric compression (“vaulting hush,” “cerulean vastness”) is consistent, pattern-taught early, and pays off in the final hush. Leo’s idiom remains credibly twelve: single awed whisper, no precocious philosophy. Minor cadence echo (“the quiet feels like her now” / “teaching it to me”) reads intentional, reinforcing transfer of guardianship.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Density high: one sentence often delivers setting, metaphor, and causal cue (“crystalline formations had stilled…plummeting noise levels she monitored”). No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with Leo’s relaxing heartbeat. One paraphrase loop detected (“vaulting hush” twice in three sentences) prevents 9.0. Otherwise scaffolding-free, propelling toward crystalline closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of speculative ferry-ride and grief-counsel feels fresh; nowhere else must one “teach silence to cradle.” Storm-glass-as-sonic-compass escalates from quaint instrument to emotional prosthesis—specific, irreplaceable. Risky lyric elevation could have tipped into pastel excess yet stays grounded via tactile carpentry (brass cradle, willow tiller). Transformation test: swap setting or object and the entire emotional math collapses.</comment>
