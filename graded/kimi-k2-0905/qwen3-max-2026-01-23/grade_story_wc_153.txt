<comment>Kael’s regret is embodied from the first line and drives every step; the shard-in-hand micro-choice at the end crystallizes a believable shift from remorse to lived forgiveness. The interior contradiction—pride vs. need to apologize—stays active in-scene, not summarized. Lena’s off-page presence still exerts pressure because her imagined forgiveness is dramatized through the condensation vision. The only minor drag is a touch of therapeutic label-speak (“decade of grief”) that briefly flattens the peak beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonlit shard becomes a charged talisman that re-weights the past without rewriting it. Cost is legible in the sob that tears loose and the vanished weight in the final paragraph. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is either because of Kael’s regret or therefore changes his interior options. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught within the first 60 words and never loosens.</comment>

<comment>Mangrove roots, blackwater, and phosphorescent spirits are filtered through Kael’s body—mud sucking at boots mirrors emotional suction. The gargoyle shard functions as micro-setting: its grooves carry cathedral rain memory and later channel moonlight that re-configures meaning. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—condensation messages, spirit song—so environment literally speaks the stake. No static cataloging; every detail is touched or heard and either constrains choice or charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unsent apology vs. pride—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens exactly once: the condensation vision forecloses the option to keep believing the letter was unread. Price is visible—Kael’s sob and the sudden weightlessness—so cost legibility meets the 600-word threshold. Agency is interior but still causal: he chooses to witness Lena’s pre-forgiveness, which rewrites his future stance. External coincidence never intervenes; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete return of rain, windows, and unsent paper: forgiveness can exist before articulation. The final image—moonlight on roots and the warm shard—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: Elara never demands confession; she simply hands him the reweighted stone. No thematic echo sentence baldly states the thesis; the spirits’ changed melody carries the resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filters—Spanish moss as veil, mud as judge. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during condensation vision, then exhales into longer cadence at release. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he saw”) because they flag mediated memory, not exposition. No head-hop; Elara’s dialogue is observed from the outside, her interior withheld, preserving distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information density is high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“mud accepting his boots without judgment”). Metaphors stay coherent: cathedral rain → memory channel → healing lens. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or texture. A single clause drifts toward poetic overlap (“weight vanished, replaced by quiet understanding”), but the cadence supports the exhale beat and does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The unsent-letter trope is refreshed by making the apology already received in the past; the twist is conceptual, not gimmick. Gargoyle shard repurposed as emotional prism feels inevitable in hindsight. Spirit chorus risks folklore cliché but is localized to mangrove acoustics and given a job—witnessing harmony—so it earns its place. Synthesis of cathedral runoff + coastal maze + lunar healing creates a specific cosmology rather than borrowed ornament.</comment>
