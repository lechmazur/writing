<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and character-specific; the ‘quiet ache’ motive grounds every beat. Contradictory impulses—cling to safety vs. step into mist—co-exist in scene, not summary. The final Charged Poise (hand over heart, glowing ticket) is earned by the prior star-imprints and meanders; cost is felt. Voice convergence under stress is minor; guides speak alike but their role is choral, not individuated, so the slight flattening is acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticket’s glowing star and hand-to-heart gesture reweight all prior meanders, proving courage was internal. Cost is visible—the snapped leash, spent twilight, and final solitude—so price test is passed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star-stamps, mist loops, and lullaby refrains tighten stakes by cadence, not causality. Orientation is taught early (“veiled ridgeway… sea mist” by line 2) and pays off at final bay reveal; no penalty.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist, stones, bench, cliff path, moonflower clearing—each micro-setting constrains tempo and breath, acting as pacing tools. The brass ticket punch is handled repeatedly, its star stamp literally pressing meaning into flesh; this object-as-setting charges closure. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound: Elara notices damp moss, not flora labels. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions across the winding route.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locate buried courage—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through cadence, not plot reversals. Each detour adds a star, increasing symbolic cost; the final imprint coincides with internal ignition. Agency is present—each step is chosen, not forced—yet pressure is lyrical, not tactical. One meaningful deepening (memory of mother’s song) reweights the stake just before closure.</comment>

<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: leash-snapping → star-stamping → heart-glow, tracing movement from external tether to internal compass. Subtext is carried in gesture and object, never sermon. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: courage is not found but carried. Shoreline lullaby motif recurs with shifting emotional charge, culminating in self-soothing heartbeat.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is salt-tanged, tide-synced, rhythmically lullaby-like. Syntax mirrors breath: long cadences for mist, clipped fragments at crests. No head-hopping; guides’ speech is stylized choral, justified by mythic role. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and concrete subject. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—mist as whispered secrets, ticket as constellation—without mixed logic. One minor purple phrase (“silver thread on dark water”) but it caps the epiphany, so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The ferry-guide star-punch on a twilight grief-walk is a fresh synthesis of Orphean/psychopomp tropes rotated into interior courage hunt. Indirect-route structure as emotional palimpsest is non-obvious and pattern-taught early. Lullaby tone married to stamp-collecting ritual feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Risk is moderate; success high enough to avoid gimmick charge.</comment>
