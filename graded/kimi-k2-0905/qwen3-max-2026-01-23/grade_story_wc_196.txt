<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trained eye” and deliberate care root motivation in concrete action. The button discovery triggers a micro-choice (reverent re-fold) that alters her stance, showing earned change. Yet the emotional arc flirts with tidy catharsis; “quiet mending begin within her” states the shift rather than embodying its cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dust pattern → envelope → button → annotation → stance shift, each because/therefore link legible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: her future is re-framed by the found kindness with felt cost—she now carries guardianship that forecloses her prior self-definition as “product of the system.” Persistent constraint (guardianship duty) shapes the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drive-lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The file room’s “dying fluorescent tube” and “metal shelves” filter through Elara’s archivist eye; sensory selection mirrors her cautious hope. The button functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice to log reverent handling. While wider world details are sparse, the selective focus tightens the emotional aperture effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—magnify buried kindnesses—is signaled early. The button discovery delivers one meaningful tightening that narrows her goal from abstract search to concrete stewardship. Cost is visible: she logs a duty that chains her to the archive’s emotional labor. Pressure remains coherent but single-peak; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inverse archaeology: kindness survives bureaucratic erasure. The button reweights “bravery” from battlefield to maternal love, reconfiguring Elara’s concept of emancipation. Final image avoids moralizing; the “page waiting for gentle hands” is resonant, non-literal payoff. Minor echo risk in “tactfully hopeful” phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—dust, grime, brass eagle noticed in archivist lexicon. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens during tactile beats, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Occasional lofted diction (“repository,” “crystallized”) slightly drifts from emancipated-youth vernacular but remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences pull double duty (action + atmosphere). One paraphrase loop detected—“quiet” appears three times in closing paragraph—minor scaffold. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Foster-archive archaeology angle feels fresh; the kindness-as-artifact lens flips typical abuse narratives without erasing them. Button-as-legacy token avoids war-story cliché by maternal re-pricing. Risk level moderate—structure defaults safe, but conceptual reframe adds lift. Could swap names without breaking arc, so freshness is solid not absolute.</comment>
