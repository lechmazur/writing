<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—urgent survival vs. reverent patience—are dramatized in micro-choices (finger extended “with the deliberate slowness of geological time”). The final renunciation costs his life, but the interiority flirts with therapy-speak: “panic was a luxury he could not afford” is label-adjacent and keeps this just outside 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: Aris’s death is the price for sealing the memory, the vial’s warm glow the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—every thread unsnarled is a because/therefore under oxygen debt. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. The final image reconfigures the distress beacon from self-rescue to memory-homing signal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the crystal vial’s changing temperature and weight act as portable environment, constraining the slow-motion ritual. Temple space is filtered through Aris’s professional sub-sea gaze—bioluminescent fungi as “constellations,” obsidian dais as tactile workstation. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body shifts. One hairline slip: “centuries of solitude” is abstract filler amid otherwise concrete selects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—immortalize a vanishing serenity—tightens exactly once: oxygen alarm at ten minutes converts abstract want into visceral trade-off. The unsnarling action is agency itself; each loosened strand forecloses Aris’s own survival. Cost is legible on the page: tunnel vision, black spots, final limp surrender. No escalation beyond this single but decisive tightening, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory as communal artifact outweighs individual extinction. The “gathered hush” motif shifts from menace to cradle, reweighting lonesome splendor into communal legacy. Final image—vial glowing against still heart—answers the thematic question wordlessly. No moralizing tagline; resonance is pure visual reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains perceptual signature rooted in sub-sea technician: “deep-sea instinct,” “geological time.” Syntax elongates/shortens with oxygen debt, creating pressure rhythm. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly Aris-bound. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he saw children” is literal memory insertion).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Zero loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are spare and physical—“woven tapestry of stillness,” “liquid gold light”—never stacked. Information density high: “crimson pulse…lonely metronome” does triple duty (color, sound, countdown). Final line lands with monosyllabic punch: “never fade.” Closure beat untouched by figurative muddle.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: oxygen deadline × memory ritual × perfume vial as capture device. Temple memory-knot is new visual trope; not derivative Atlantis riff. Conceptual risk—protagonist dies for art—commits fully. Slight deduction: “last collective memory” premise edges near abstract cliché until grounded by specific vignettes.</comment>
