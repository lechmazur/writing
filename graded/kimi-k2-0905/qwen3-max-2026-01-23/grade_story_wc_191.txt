<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—ruby flake pulsing, sweat at temples—and her renunciation at the end (“turned from the staircase”) is earned by the successive paint-peel choices that show her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she never wavers between ascent and restoration, so the beat feels inevitable rather than wrestled-with. Still, the cost is visible—dissolving shard, foregone crown—so the arc satisfies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: ruby shard → orchard entry → paint-peel method → mural reveal → stairway → refusal. Each beat because/therefore narrows her options until dawn crystallizes the barrier; the final renunciation reconfigures the quest and lands cost on-page (“ruby flake dissolved”). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall, silver-barked trees, and peeling paint strata are filtered through Elara’s keeper-bias; each sensory layer also functions as tool or obstacle (waterfall gate, paint concealment). The Heartstone Monolith constrains her method and charges the closure image. One minor slip: “neon glow surrendered to ancient wilds” is visual cliché, but it doesn’t scar the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each peeled layer; the clock visibly alters her tactics (faster scraping, breath-held motion). Cost is legible: she forfeits personal ascension and exhausts the artifact. No reversal, but the single meaningful tightening is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-restoration emerges from the paint strata and her final act of vocal replanting; no explicit thesis stated. The unclaimed throne is reweighted from seat of power to catalyst of return, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Resonance lingers in “seeds of memory in hand.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice carries distinct perceptual signature—lore-keeper diction (“star-charts of constellations long vanished”) and synesthetic compression (“liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence in still orchard, clipped fragments at dawn blush. No head-hopping; elisions (“decades of study”) are anchored and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description folded into action (“She drew the ruby flake, its sharp edge honed by time and purpose”). No scaffold loops; only one metaphor stack in the waterfall paragraph, but it is pattern-taught early and justifies itself. Minor register elevation (“profound stillness”) does not propagate into closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-orchard and palimpsest monolith feels fresh; the paint-peel-as-time-travel device transforms familiar “hidden mural” trope. Specificity of orchard dyes, geothermal taps, and Treaty of Twin Moons anchors the conceit. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the World Tree staircase reconfigures the quest premise.</comment>
