<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlo’s interiority runs concrete and particular—his “tight press of lips,” the brass weight “like a stone,” the utility-pole rosary—so we feel fracture without label-speak. The contradictory impulse (earthbound penance vs. star-love) stays active in-scene; the moment he wipes dew from the compass glass is a micro-choice that tilts the arc. Cost is felt: the vanished whistle, the tears that “mix with salt spray,” the final acceptance of the scar. A hairline slip: “competence shattered into regret” edges toward abstract summary; still, the arc earns its quiet realignment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he miscalc’d once, therefore earthbound pole-counting; because poles vanish, therefore sky-gravity returns. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the compass re-anchored, humility re-priced—crystallized in the image of the needle “a tiny altar.” Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of self-punishment and embraces the very instrument that once betrayed him. Orientation locked by line 3; no telegraphing of the compass re-acceptance until the wipe-dew beat, keeping torque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The coastal launch, splintered poles, cliff-mist, and brass compass all filter through Arlo’s mariner gaze—selective, occupational, never touristic. Utility-pole #1’s “scarred…weather and time” mirrors his skin; Venus later becomes the “diamond needle stitching night to day,” recharging the same visual grammar. Environment forces choice: when poles end, the lack of terrestrial anchor obliges skyward reorientation. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the compass in bow-as-altar constrains final tactics and images.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he navigate without self-condemnation?—is signaled early. Escalation arrives the instant poles disappear: option set collapses from terrestrial to celestial, pressure crystallizes. Protagonist agency drives the turn: he actively lifts gaze, wipes glass, mounts compass. Cost is renunciation of penance-as-identity; felt price lands in the shanty-hum that replaces silence. One hair under 9 only because external antagonistic force is geography itself—less personal than human opposition—but still cleanly earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation with one’s own flaw via re-integration of the beloved but feared tool—emerges purely through action and image (poles, stars, compass glass). No explicit thesis; the final shanty offers Charged Poise rather than moral. Subtext in the silence of seals watching: nature as witness to absolution. Complexity preserved: the scar endures, now worn, not erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person受限 inside Arlo’s perceptual field: sound of wires “humming a faint, grounding song,” taste of salt spray, brass chill. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“impossible clarity, a diamond needle…”) then shortens at decision (“He secured…”). No head-hop; psychic distance tightens only at wipe-dew beat. Dialogue absent by design; internal whistle and shanty serve as voice modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Salt-and-kelp diction stays specific: “splintered giant,” “guttering candle,” “dome of sky.” Metaphors are few, sharp, never stacked; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with paddle strokes; no template cadence. One near-loop: “flickering faith…flickering faith” frames opening and close, but here it functions as deliberate reprise, not scaffold, so waived. High information density: single sentence often carries sensory cue + emotional valence + plot pivot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-to-redemption arc is refreshed through the idiosyncratic navigation method—counting weathered utility poles—and the inversion that the compass was never broken, only trust was. Specificity of maritime professional detail (oilskin pouch, bearing miscalculation, star fix) lifts it above generic guilt story. Risk taken: quiet lyric closure instead of cathartic storm, and it pays off. Not quite 9 because core emotional engine remains recognizable.</comment>
