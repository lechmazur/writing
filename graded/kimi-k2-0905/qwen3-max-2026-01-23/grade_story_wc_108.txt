<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (“knuckles white against the rusted iron shelf”) and drives the rooftop choice; her shift from exploited double to protective mentor is credibly forced by Lily’s peril. Interiority occasionally drifts into self-diagnosis (“she had woven its hyper-awareness into their salvation”) but contradictory impulses coexist in the moment of deciding to climb. Micro-choices—etching the shell, leading Lily upward—trace a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost. The bond with Lily is forged through shared fragility rather than convenience, satisfying the relationship-as-crucible test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: DNA betrayal → flight → shell discovery → decryption → decoy → rooftop escape; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell’s whisper is repurposed, Silas is lured away, and Elara’s phobia is not cured but re-instrumented—cost is felt in the trembling ascent and the tears that “fell freely.” Orientation is anchored by word 48; no lens ambiguity. One minor elasticity: the quarry river is introduced only during the etching beat, yet the tactic succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is tactile—“oxidation trails weeping down specific shelves”—and actively navigated; the rooftop stars mirror the crayon map, charging the final image. Body-as-setting is used when Elara’s claustrophobic skin response dictates vertical flight. Spatial choreography is clean: vent location, staircase, and roof sight-lines track. The shell’s faint bone-vibration is a selective sensory detail that later constrains the signal-rewrite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protection of Lily and self-liberation from Silas—is signaled by word 88 and tightened when headlights slice the roof. Escalation is causal: each decryption discovery reduces escape routes until the shell itself is weaponized. The price is legible: Elara’s phobia is not defeated but endured in the climb, and Silas remains at large, preserving threat. One meaningful turn—choosing ascent over concealment—forecloses hiding and crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges through action, not sermon: Elara’s trembling hands still etch the shell, and Lily’s trust is earned by admitting fear. The conch shell shifts from tracker to decoy, reweighting Silas’s weapon against him. Final image of two small figures under “endless stars” offers quiet conceptual repricing: the sky once mocked Elara’s entrapment, now hosts her first free breath. No moralizing line distills the theme; resonance is left open yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: rust smells, bone-level shell vibration, and shelf geometry are noticed through stunt-trained eyes. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures during climb—“Trust the stars”—mirroring pulse. Lily’s child diction (“the shell talks”) is distinct without caricature. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses appropriately as headlights approach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-duty: “feverish betrayal still scorching her veins” conveys temperature and emotion in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato climb beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances position or stakes. Minor register lift—“re-instrumented”—is justified by Elara’s film-tech background.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The stunt-double-with-claustrophobia premise is fresh, and weaponizing a child’s cast-cipher via seashell tracker feels specific rather than gimmicky. Silas’s exploitation of authentic terror reframes Hollywood abuse into intimate gothic. Risk—climbing a rusted roof while phobic—earns closure without deus ex machina. The synthesis of film stunt craft, childhood artifact, and star map is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
