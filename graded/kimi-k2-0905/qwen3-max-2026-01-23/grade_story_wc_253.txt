<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—knife, blood, bird sculpture externalize grief without label-speak. The contradiction between performed cheer and interior collapse stays active in-scene. Cost is visible: the sparrow placed in dead flowers crystallizes renunciation of the old mask. Missing second character keeps relationship crucible off-page, capping score just below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cedar curl and narrated line thickens density until the final sparrow reweights silence. Closure is Earned Stasis—he forecloses public performance, cost felt in the un-wiped tear. Orientation anchor (farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadow) arrives by line 3. One soft spot: “Happiness Mandate collapsed six months prior” is lone exposition lump before present stimuli.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Turbine shadow, vibrating floorboards, and knife shavings create a micro-setting that constrains his ritual pace. Light/dark sweep across bouquet in final beat charges the image. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile—wood dust, blood bead—true to a carver’s skilled hands. Environment silently endorses the remade hush without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he trade mandated mask for sustainable grief?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through pattern break: narration flips from stage rhetoric to prayer as blade slips. Cost is legible: blood, relinquished mask, sparrow lodged in dead flowers. One tightening suffices for 700-word piece; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence can be re-authored into sanctuary, not fear. Final sparrow-in-flowers image offers non-literal answer—flight memory inside decay. No moralizing sentence intrudes. Moral ambiguity of using Elara’s bouquet as prop is acknowledged, not tidied, preserving complexity.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter—notice what a performer would: cadence, audience (empty chairs), theatrical throat-clear. Syntax lengthens during mock soliloquy, contracts to whispers at climax, mirroring emotional drop. No head-hopping; turbine hum becomes diegetic metronome. Distinct texture sustained without self-indulgence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence splits wood, advances grief, or anchors setting. Rhythm modulates—long oratory curls give way to short prayer clauses. Figurative language stays coherent (wood curls = memories). One tiny loop: “remade hush” appears three times within fifty words mid-story; doesn’t obscure closure but prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing propaganda-era “happiness police” with solitary whittling ritual is fresh angle on grief-lit. Sparrow carved from cedar of coffin-class wood feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk in dramatizing mundane task through self-narration pays off; never seen grief processed this way. Could swap turbines for pylons, so setting device not wholly singular.</comment>
