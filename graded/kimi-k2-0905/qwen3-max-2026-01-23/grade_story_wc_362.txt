<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (“sharp eyes missed no detail,” “breath steady, focus absolute”), motivation is consistent, and the micro-shift from certainty to humility is earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the turn is recognition-only, so the 9-test is missed. The single-POV, one-character frame fits scope; no status dynamics required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“truth favored authenticity over intensity”). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern break (gentle spiral amid chaos) tightens meaning once. Orientation is clear by line 4, one shard, one transition (mist parting), cost legible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frost windshield is micro-setting that constrains the reading act and charges the final image; quartz arbor hum reprises in last line. Selective sensory detail (cool prism, damp soil, feathery dendrites) is filtered through Kael’s empirical bias. Spatial choreography holds; no world-rule breaks. Environment actively guides the communion choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emotional absorption—signaled early; the spiral discovery is the single meaningful tightening that reweights options. Agency is Kael’s interpretive act; cost is the collapse of his theory and public credibility. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no causal reversals required. Cost is legible in final image (droplets as prisms of transformed view).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal: loud anger vs. quiet endurance as the true residue. Subtext is carried by frost image and spiral gesture; no explicit moralizing. Final reweighting (“objects absorb emotions, yet discern sincerity from noise”) is earned through specific sensory experience. Resonance is concrete, avoids platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise, empirical, sensory-led (“glass prism felt cool and precise,” “jagged scars of that conflict”). Diction stays in Kael’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates with tension; no syntactic monotony. Single POV held cleanly; no dialogue hence no voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; sentences advance character, image, and concept simultaneously (“Raising the prism, he caught the sun’s first beam… fracturing light across the frost-etched surface”). No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight. No artifact appears in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—reading emotions in frost—is non-obvious; the inversion that quiet care out-records anger feels fresh. Spiral image is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Structural risk (single beat of recognition) is taken without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if Kael’s empirical stance is removed, confirming organic synthesis.</comment>
