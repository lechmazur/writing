<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s vocation and muteness form a taut inner contradiction that powers every beat; her tactile tuning and silent perception embody motive without exposition. The elders’ signed plea anchors her resolve, and her final touch on the spent fragment crystallizes earned stasis—she forecloses speech yet pays nothing in on-page loss, capping the arc just short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain: wind-turn → bell-sound → light-glisten → communal remembrance; each step tightens under Accumulative lens until the fragment dims, reconfiguring meaning with visible cost (“surrendered its light completely”). Orientation anchors inside 60 words; closure beat lands with undeniable price and persistent constraint—the spent ice forecloses repetition today.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The bluff’s wind, stone, and spinning ice function as micro-setting that constrains every action; distance, temperature, and light angles must be exact or the symphony fails. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves between vanes and cradle. The iceberg fragment’s state-change (glisten → dull) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore collective memory of blue—tightens once when the solstice angle triggers the fragment’s glisten, narrowing possibility to this instant. Escalation is accumulative: each bell strike and light scatter deepens the same stake until the fragment exhausts its stored color, paying the visible cost. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is a consumable pigment, not an infinite resource. The iceberg’s spent light reweights the premise—wonder is mined, not mirrored. No moralizing; the final image of Elara’s silent touch reconfigures value without statement. Resonant reconfiguration satisfies closure and lingers past the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a hush-lexicon of murmurs, whispers, glisten, hush—syntax lengthens and breathes like wind. Perceptual signature is synesthetic, privileging vibration over voice. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses only under the final vane push. Pattern-taught elision (“after words became unnecessary”) pays off in the closing silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, echoing bell resonance; no loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “a pocket of primordial winter” conveys cold and time in one stroke. Opening and closing lines bracket the symphony without scaffold. Zero artifacts in peak beats; fragment’s glisten/dull transition stays physically coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The post-linguistic sound-and-light orchestra feels novel yet inevitable; the consumable iceberg-as-pigment reframes climate grief as chromatic loss. Risk is quiet—no villain, no spectacle—yet stakes feel planetary because color itself is mortal. Synthesis is specific: tuning + muteness + consumable memory yields a fresh angle on eco-grief without sermon.</comment>
