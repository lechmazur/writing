<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass lineage give concrete interior texture; the shift from “awkward confidence” to resolve is legible via bodily resonance with the stones. Yet the epiphany is delivered in abstract summary (“understood the lull…as a vital margin”) rather than dramatized contradiction, so the cost feels cerebral, not visceral. Still, the micro-choice to carry the hum outward supplies a credible renunciation of despair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael foregoes vengeance for story-carrying, a path sealed by the hum now “resonating within his own chest”—cost is embodied. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (cold permacrete, violet light, stone vibration) tightens the stake from private ache to generational duty. One causality wobble: the rebel texts mentioning “attune to stone hum” arrive as retroactive exposition, blunting the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<comment>The fractured dome’s violet seam and glittering tool-spill are selectively filtered through Kael’s mechanic eye; spaceport decay mirrors internal desolation without overt mirroring cliché. The stone circle’s hum is rendered as somatic percussion, turning granite into a tactile antagonist that actively cleanses the air—environment constrains stance. Spatial choreography stays clean: barefoot soles track temperature shifts from permacrete to mossed granite, anchoring the transition.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and deepens when the lull is re-priced from surrender to sacred pause. Escalation is accretive: each sensory beat (cold, hum, memory) raises the cost of retreat. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological. The final quiet engine inside his chest is a felt price, though it could sharpen if an explicit tactical option were foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as endurance-as-resistance: stones outlast empires, so stories can too. Subtext lives in objects—opera glasses shift from relic to conduit, reweighting ancestral witnessing without sermon. The closing image of barefoot steps carrying thunderous serenity offers a non-literal answer that reconfigures the rebellion’s tempo. Avoids explicit thesis until the grandmother echo, a late but single thematic articulation that barely stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Kael’s somatic register; diction stays close to a mechanic’s poetry (“landing struts,” “tool carts glittering like forgotten tears”). Sentence rhythm lengthens under stone hum, then contracts at exit, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice purity remains uncontested. One filter-verb cluster (“felt,” “felt,” “understood”) softens peak immediacy but stays below artifact threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; concrete nouns anchor metaphor (“needle of hope”). Occasional modifier stacks (“profound, aching lull”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative mood. No loops, no mixed metaphors, clean tense. Two near-successive “hum” sentences could fuse for density, yet the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spaceport cyber-ruin with neolithic stone circle feels inevitable rather than stitched, generating fresh mythic SF texture. Opera glasses as intergenerational telescope invert typical tech fetish, centering acoustic relic instead. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending instead of armed uprising—but coherence stays intact. Not radical, yet the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
