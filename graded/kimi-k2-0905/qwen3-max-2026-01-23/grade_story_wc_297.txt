<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her wrist birthmark flares, her body “hums,”—but the contradiction between dread and hope is stated more than dramatized; still, the final press of the clipping into the rift is credibly costly and rooted in her scar-map.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scar-touch tightens the stake until the maze-path and clipping-seed reweight the covenant; the closing image of the sapling maze-leaf is a clean CR with felt cost. Orientation is secured by word 70; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Cobalt glade,” “violet-hemorrhaging sky,” and the oak’s lightning scar are vivid, selective, and bias-filtered through Elara; the glade’s micro-setting (moss, bark, sapling) constrains her foot-placement and charges the final image, but one more sensory anchor (smell of torn sap?) would have pushed 8+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mend the dream-tear or lose the earth’s covenant—tightens once: the maze-path narrows her options to pressing the clipping into the rift; cost is visible (burning birthmark, pouring scars) but external pressure stays mystical rather than tactical, keeping escalation just shy of 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from scar-as-memory-as-repair; no moralizing, only the final sapling image re-prices the covenant as living relationship. The quiet refusal to let the future stay chaotic is earned through concrete scar-offerings; ambiguity lingers in the branching maze-leaves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays stable; diction (“root-bound visionary,” “purposefully curious”) is character-specific and rhythmic; patterned elision (“the future arrived early”) is taught early and paid off in the last line. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Strong information density—most lines do two jobs—but occasional modifier stacks (“anxious elation,” “quiet promise”) and two near-repetitions of “purposefully curious” slightly dull peak beats. No mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with scene pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The scar-map as living cartography and maze-leaf seed feel fresh; dream-nexus mending is familiar but re-weighted by visceral scar-exchange. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—yet coherence stays high; transformation survives proximity test.</comment>
