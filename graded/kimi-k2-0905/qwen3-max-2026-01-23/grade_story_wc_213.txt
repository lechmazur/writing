<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—lifelong duty versus empirical doubt—plays out in concrete micro-choices: checking gauges, tasting air, hovering hand over rope. The final refusal carries visible communal cost (panicked memory of last false alarm) and personal cost (release of “decades of expectation”), satisfying Earned Stasis. Only minor shortfall: the hinge from doubt to final resolve could use one more embodied beat of hesitation to earn full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each data observation tightens the no-storm probability, therefore narrowing her options until the rope becomes the final fork. Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost—Abbot’s smile confirms institutional risk absorbed. Orientation, transitions, and set-up/payoff on the resin-mended rope are impeccably placed; no causal gaps or teleporting info.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: frost-feather angles, ibex calm, barometric brass—these tools constrain her decision path and charge the final “untouched rope” image. Spatial choreography remains exact from parapet to shadow-tip. Meeting 9+ gate: the mended bell rope, a micro-setting object, literally guides her hand and reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community safety versus truth—tightens through each data beat; calm high-pressure system forecloses the ritual option with measurable on-page evidence. Single meaningful turn suffices: the refusal at zero-hour crystallizes stance and carries institutional cost (potential loss of faith in prophecy). Pressure stays coherent; no escalation slippage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: every atmospheric whisper versus human noise culminates in the rope’s silence; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of rope behind glass reweights prior false alarms without moralizing. Subtext in Abbot’s whispered “You listened” honors cost while acknowledging shared risk, inviting reader reflection on institutional wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual lens—wind language, tool feel, scientific diction—without head-hop. Syntax breathes with ritual slowness then compresses at the decision beat. No dialogue artifacts; sparse speech fits monastic hush. Distinct texture in phrases like “frost-feather angles” and “solstice hush” teaches pattern early and pays off at end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere; no filler, loops, or scaffold. Figurative choices (“ice crystals tapping like distant chimes”) serve pressure without crowding. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors mounting calm then final release. Copy-clean; mended rope motif tracked without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar “prophecy versus science” trope but freshens via microclimate method, monastic barometric instruments, and inversion: silence as triumph. Specificity of pine-resin glue, brass gauges, and solstice-shadow alignment makes the concept inseparable from this place and voice. Slight risk deduction because the core arc still walks a known line, though execution is superb.</comment>
