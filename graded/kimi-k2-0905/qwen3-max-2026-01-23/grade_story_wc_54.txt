<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s soil-stained boots and “poetry in stress calculations” give tactile, specific interiority; the sextant protractor beat shows micro-choice under pressure. Motivation stays steady, but the final equation is declared rather than dramatized with cost, keeping her short of full contradiction. Still, her functional creativity visibly shapes tactics—no convenient amnesia, no stock labels—so the arc earns credible endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liquid constellation reweights the premise that hope equals creative intention × redirected flow, with the sextant left at the source as visible cost. Causal chain (find relic → measure angle → dig channel → water flows) holds without teleportation; orientation is anchored by word 34. One meaningful tightening occurs when the trickle becomes a refracted star chart, foreclosing abandonment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The terminal’s damp patch near Gate Seven and the oculus cleaned just enough for sunset refraction are selective, pressure-relevant details; the sextant fragment acts as micro-setting that constrains the exact angle of the channel. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from hatch to basin. Environment directly supplies the resource that enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can abandoned infrastructure birth new purpose?—is signaled early and tightened once: the water’s arrival reframes the terminal from tomb to observatory. Cost is the physical labor and the irreversible placement of the relic as dam; no coincidence resolves the blockage. Agency is continuous; no external savior appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the refracted star chart: resurrection is not nostalgic restoration but reconfiguring flow. No final-paragraph thesis states this; the image reweights prior material. The equation is voiced, but it is the protagonist’s private shorthand, not authorial sermon, and is earned by the preceding tactile struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—“soil-stained boots,” “intuitive precision”—with no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her engineering mind: calibrated metaphors, precise verbs. Register never drifts into academic brochure; even “conceptual repricing” is avoided in the text itself. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the prying of bolts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“liquid constellation” pays off the sextant motif. Information density is high: one sentence often advances action, reveals setting, and carries metaphor. Minor scaffold: “quiet hum of resolve” is faintly generic but does not touch the closure beat.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Using a tarnished sextant shard to calculate a drainage angle that turns a derelict spaceport into a planetarium is a fresh synthesis; the relic’s prior function literally guides the redesign. The “equation for hope” could feel gimmicky, but it is grounded in the character’s vocation and left as private notation, avoiding TED-talk trap. Risk is taken with the lyric final image and pays off.</comment>
