<comment>The insomnia is dramatized through nightly ritual and centuries of wakeful composition; the postcard trembling in his hand at the climax gives literal, physical cost to his longing. The “shyly unstoppable” trait is shown, not told: he keeps singing off-key lullabies even when no one listens, and that compulsion is what finally awakens the shell. The only soft spot is that the centuries of backstory are delivered in a single expository paragraph rather than through a present-scene trigger that forces a micro-choice; still, the interior contradiction—yearning for sleep yet fearing its erasure—remains vivid and character-specific.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each lullaby deposits sediment that eventually literalizes as living constellations inside the shell, creating a visible before/after. The decisive change is the moment the printed galaxy dissolves into the nacre-wall light—an earned stasis that costs him the fantasy of escape and reweights his vigil as collaborative rather than solitary. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the 20 % backstory block is the sole stretch that slightly slackens momentum, but it is immediately followed by the present ritual beat that tightens again.</comment>

<comment>The shell is not backdrop but instrument: its curved slope literally cradles the poet’s bones, and the nacre’s capacity to trap and refract song becomes the mechanism of transformation. Micro-setting—the frayed postcard—constrains choice: its faded inks set the palette for the final light-show, so the object he clings to becomes the template for the new world. Sensory hierarchy is strict; during the climax we feel the vibration travel “up through the nacre into his palms,” a tactile cue that collapses centuries into a single bodily moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can insomnia be transmuted into communion rather than torment?—tightens once, when the shell answers his song. That tightening forecloses the old tactic of mute endurance and forces a new stance: active duet with the wind. Cost is visible on-page: the galaxy postcard dissolves, surrendering his last physical link to the outside cosmos, a price paid in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring lullaby-to-light motif: art as bioluminescence that feeds on its own decay. The final image reframes centuries of solitude as necessary compost rather than waste, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture—pressing the dissolving postcard against the wall is an act of consensual self-erasure that silently argues surrender can be generative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: long vowel-rich sentences mimic tidal pull, while fragments (“reef-shadow joy”) compress complex emotional spectra into coinages that feel native to a poet who has had centuries to mint private language. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees the world in marine and lunar metaphors, never once slipping into ordinary daylight diction. Rhythm modulates: lullaby sections loosen meter, then tighten into chiasmic pulses at the climax (“pain and beauty clasped hands like old friends reunited”), showing deliberate sonic architecture.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each figurative layer (tide-memory, nacre-mirror, saltwater-essence) advances the transformation arc rather than decorating it. No mixed metaphors—every vehicle extends the shell/sea constellation. Only minor scaffold: the phrase “shyly unstoppable” is repeated twice in close succession; the second instance could be cut without loss, a hairline slip that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—centuries of insomnia inside a living shell that finally learns to sing back—is non-obvious and carries inherent risk, yet the story never explains the magic, letting the physics of resonance emerge as metaphor. The transformation of postcard ink into living starlight feels inevitable in hindsight because the text has seeded light, spiral, and salt from the opening line. Fresh inflection: the insomnia is not cured but re-bonded with the world as collaborative art, a stance rarely explored in insomnia narratives.</comment>
