<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s grief-mapping motive is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“sacred geography… soul”) that blurs concrete contradiction; the thread-cued vision grants her knowledge without a micro-choice that costs her anything, so the final “compass” feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each garden image layers density until the oak sapling reweights absence as cultivated ground. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s journal presses the thread, crystallizing her new cartographer stance with visible conceptual cost: she must now carry the map she sought. Orientation anchors early; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frosted leaves “like shattered stained glass,” persimmon placed in palm, and oak planted on the boy’s birthday all tether sensory detail to stakes; the garden’s micro-sites (sundial, arch, pond) constrain Elara’s attention and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode Isolde’s absence—tightens once when Kael reveals the queen’s redirected love; Elara’s agency is reception, not action, so the cost is observational rather than tactical, keeping pressure just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-as-gardening emerges through concrete particulars (tears watering seeds, oak around loss) without moralizing; the final image of the garden “holding its breath” reweights absence as fertile ground, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “salt-thick twilight,” “bruised sky,” and synesthetic thread-warmth create a consistent atmospheric voice; no head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variety and high density (“Autumn had bled the maples bare…”) propel the piece; occasional poetic stack (“skeletal branches etched against a bruised sky”) risks purple but stops short of muddling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Obituary-for-the-living conceit and grief-cartography feel fresh; the garden-as-map trope is familiar, yet the persimmon birthday oak and thread-tethered vision particularize it enough to avoid derivative drift.</comment>
