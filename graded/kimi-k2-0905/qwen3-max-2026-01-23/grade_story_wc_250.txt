<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s silence-as-empathy is dramatized through micro-gesture (mirror angling, shutter choreography) rather than label; Elara’s shift from paralysis to released sob is embodied, not explained. Interior contradiction is missing—Kael never doubts, Elara never resists—which flattens the crucible. Still, the final Earned Stasis (shared gaze, pocketed mirror) carries visible cost: the secret stays unspoken yet is metabolized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the aligned-shutter constellation reframes Orion as a conceptual repricing of Elara’s despair. Causality is Accumulative—each shutter-sliver layers light until the sky’s pattern, not confession, becomes the decisive change. Cost is legible in the “sacred quiet” and the mirror’s retirement—Kael foregoes further intervention, Elara foregoes speech. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain-polished cobalt dock is not backdrop but tool: its mirror-wet planks accept the star-beam, literally enabling the climactic reprise. Micro-setting (dental mirror, boot-lace) constrains the only possible angle for the light transfer. Petrichor and obsidian canal compress atmosphere into the final image where water doubles the stars. Spatial choreography tracks clean from puddle to eaves to Orion frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara step or speak—is signaled in the first paragraph; tightening occurs as each shutter reduces her options to literal cosmic scale. Agency is Elara’s synchronized breath and upward gaze; price is the unspeakable secret now permanently internalized. Pressure escalates texturally—light density increases rather than causal beats—sufficient under Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification meets short-form threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: darkness taught to value stars via literal optical lesson. Subtext resides in mirror’s repurposing—medicine → cosmology—and shutter lattice that weaponizes ordinary architecture. Final image reweights secrecy from shame to stellar membership; no moral is stated. The emotional aftereffect is awe rather than catharsis, earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric ventriloquizes Kael’s silent perception: “spiralingly calm” neologism, tactile verbs like “click,” “slide,” “leap.” Rhythm contracts under pressure—single-line paragraphs during shutter sequence mimic cardiac pacing. No dialogue; thus no voice convergence. Free indirect slides cleanly into Elara’s “red-rimmed eyes” without head-hop. Diction stays within canal-guardian cosmos: no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary from 5-word imperative fragments to 35-word accumulative coils; no template cadence. Figurative density peaks at “luminous vine” yet pays off when the vine blossoms into Orion frame—controlled, not decorative. Zero paraphrase loops; each shutter verb advances pattern. Line-level propulsion matches light’s forward motion; final line “pocketed the dental mirror” lands with percussive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silent guardian + dental mirror + shutter-constellation synthesis feels specific, not gimmicked: the mirror’s prior medical life gives starlight a diagnostic slant. Risk—lyric compression of causality—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure stays legible. Emotional truth (unspeakable grief met by wordless optics) transcends trope. Could not swap dock for rooftop without breaking optics logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.2</grade><grade>Silent canal guardian drives every beat: mirror angle, shutter weave, final nod. Silence is not absence but active instrument that redefines Elara’s options. Cost—permanent self-silence—visible when he pockets the mirror, task complete.</grade>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</grade><grade>Dental mirror appears beat 1, returns charged at end; handle worn smooth signals decades of silent ministry. Its optical pivot literalizes “teach darkness the value of stars.” Remove it and the causal chain collapses—no light path, no Orion frame.</grade>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><grade>Silent empathy is the operational method, not theme tag: Kael’s wordless mirror-gift and shutter choreography are tactical empathy. It enables Elara’s upward gaze—changes her stance with cost (secret remains unspoken). Lyric reprise in shared quiet.</grade>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><grade>Spiralingly calm is coinage that performs its meaning—calm that widens inward like a spiral, drawing her agitation down. Trait constrains Kael’s tactics: he never resorts to speech even when a word might shortcut risk.</grade>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><grade>Weave is literal shutter manipulation and metaphor for relational lattice. Each open/close is a micro-choice that builds the final constellation image. Action redefines Elara’s perceptual field—turns warehouses into sky-map. Irreplaceable.</grade>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.0</grade><grade>Creating patterns with shutters is mechanics and metaphor; mechanics taught on-page (open, close, center align). Pattern culminates in Orion frame—conceptual repricing of architecture as telescope. Failure to perform it would abort the climax.</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><grade>Cobalt dock after rain is not scenery but optical necessity: wet planks act as secondary mirror, doubling starlight. Color cobalt recurs in “azure,” “obsidian,” binding earth to sky. Setting enables the mirror’s reflection path.</grade>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><grade>Half-spoken secret creates real-time tension—each breath could tip into confession—but temporal tracking is vague (no clock). Still, the secret’s pendulum status pressures Elara’s stance until the constellation shift ends the clock by making speech redundant.</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><grade>Motivation “teach darkness the value of stars” is stated early yet enacted through concrete optics, not abstract sermon. Kael’s method incurs cost: he forfeits ever being understood aloud. Desire and tactic are inseparable.</grade>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stillwater tension is maintained in canal surface, withheld breath, and mirrored stars; tone modulates upward into wonder as shutters build to Orion reveal. Final image releases tension into expansive quiet, reconfiguring prior dread into awe.</comment>
