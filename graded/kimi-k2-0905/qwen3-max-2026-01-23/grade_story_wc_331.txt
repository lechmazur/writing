<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile obsession with the scarf and her refusal to archive digitally are concrete, embodied motives. The micro-choice of aligning the frayed edge with the asymptotic curve crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Memory is not summarized but performed through silk texture and curvature. Cost is legible: she forfeits certainty for resonance, carrying “the library of folds within her.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scarf-fold reweights the premise that stories need a “place.” Hyperbolic geometry is not metaphor but literal method, signaled early and paid off in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of textile memory reconfigures meaning. One shard, one transition (Contemplation Nook), no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library is rendered as a micro-setting of oak desk, green lamp, vellum chart—objects that constrain method. Spatial choreography is clean: patrons drift, Elara slips, scarf is aligned, chart unrolled. Sensory hierarchy obeys her POV: scent of lavender overrules visual grandeur. Weather and city lights exist only as reflected stanzas, keeping scale intimate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove stories survive after the book closes—tightens once: the scarf-fold must verify the grandmother’s claim or falsify it. Escalation is textural: each tactile recall deepens density until the fold physically maps infinity. No antagonist needed; the asymptotic curve is the pressure. Cost is the acceptance of unlocatable location, a felt conceptual loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from textile physics: memory is curvature, not storage. No moralizing; the final line reweights “analog warmth” as the true archive. Subtext in the grandmother’s “space between the threads” reframes absence as presence. The scarf’s return re-prices the entire quest from search to embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “sonnets calculated orbital trajectories” teaches the pattern. Compression is purposeful—“quiet ballet,” “humming silence.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices weave pulls, asymptotic curves, not crowd faces.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short crystalline images to longer cadenced clauses without algorithmic drumbeat. No scaffold loops; each line advances texture or knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“library of folds” recurs with new charge. Register stays within POV lexicon: “tessellations,” “asymptotic” are tools she would know.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses rare domains: hyperbolic geometry + textile memory + poetry library. Grandmother’s fold-lesson is fresh world logic, not trope. Risk of preciousness averted by concrete handling of silk and vellum. Transformation test fails if scarf replaced—entire closure collapses.</comment>
