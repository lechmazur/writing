<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—fractured loom memory, quiet ember motive—remains specific and embodied; the singing beats show contradictory impulses (fragility vs determination) under rising pressure. Her micro-choice to release the final note costs the century of vigil and is earned by the causal chain of song-swaddle-dawn. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; keeper role is shown through ritual action, not label. Memory fragments integrate into present tension without diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawn unfurls, despair loosens, cost is the relinquished vigil felt in the final whispered note. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each remembered lyric adds luminous thread-density until the pattern breaks night. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50 within the single greenhouse scene; no drift. Causality intact: because she sings, therefore dawn knits; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mica window and Heartseed function as micro-setting objects that constrain action—swaddling requires the moss-and-silk, singing must touch the glass to birth dawn. Copper alembics, vials, prismatic tears supply selective sensory texture without list bloat; twilight scale matches emotional stakes. Spatial choreography clean: kneeling, pressing palm, dewdrop sphere track logically. Environment’s state evolves—dull ash leaf → gold pulse, reflection → generated light—mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling realm before endless night—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when each sung syllable visibly forecloses isolation by knitting saffron threads across the sky. Protagonist agency is the singing endurance that pays the vigil cost; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates through lyrical accumulation under Accumulative lens; visible price is the century-long vigil relinquished. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; closure cost legible.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal reweaving emerges from the concrete image sequence—bread shared, fences mended, stories traded—rather than assertion. Final image of dewdrop holding miniature sunrise reweights prior fragments into covenant restored. No moralizing line; resonance left charged and ambiguous. Subtext operates in silence between song notes and the bell answering from valleys.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through alchemical texture and musical memory. Syntax stretches into incantatory cadence that mirrors song-swelling without drumbeat monotony. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of mythic keeper; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“shattered loom,” “quiet ember”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template runs. Figurative language is patterned—woven, thread, loom—taught by 25 % and avoids mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often conveys sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Zero paraphrase loops; final-line release punctuates without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror-world where reflections outperform substance offers fresh angle on memory-as-light; “woven dawns” concept feels inevitable by closure. Keeps lyric eco-fantasy from drifting into generic radiant seed trope via alchemical orchard specifics and song mechanics. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without obscuring causality. Could swap names but not the exact loom/song/mica synergy, so transformation present if not absolute.</comment>
