<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“calloused finger traced the rim”); motivation remains steady. The decisive turn—choosing documentation over vengeance—could use one beat of visible cost (a tremor, a hesitation) to earn full 9-band; still, contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene and the renunciation is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: pocketing the sundial converts shame into vigilance with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—because she decodes the coordinates, therefore she rewrites her path. One micro-turn at the coordinates revelation tightens stakes; no因果 breaks. Orientation is clean by line 5; twilight canal anchors who/where/when immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canal, barge deck, and sundial operate as micro-setting that constrains attention and final choice. Selective sensory triage—“obsidian surface mirroring skeletal cranes”—mirrors her narrowing focus. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props. Because the sundial (tool) charges the final image, the 9-band gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the lie—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens once when hidden numerals re-target the quest. Escalation is knowledge-based under causal lens; options narrow from “chase myth” to “document fraud.” Felt cost is present but diffuse; a sharper tangible loss (radio silence = career bridge burned?) would push 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity versus curated deceit emerges through the sundial’s re-pricing rather than exposition. Final image—“carrying salvaged truth like a lantern”—offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior motifs. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what “documentation” will cost her. Insight is earned via concrete decoding, not label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise (“scent of aged paper, his theatrical flourish”). Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses at reveal, mirroring cognitive rhythm. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinctive cadence supports the lyric closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density—single sentences layer mood, back-story cue, and prop handling. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“cathedral of deceit” paid off by “blueprint”); no mixed metaphors. One adjacent paraphrase loop (“quiet, burning motivation” vs “quiet, burning motivation”) is a hairline scar. Closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reframing the treasure-hunt trope into forensic self-exoneration feels fresh; Thorne’s micro-expression cheat is specific rather than stock. Risk is moderate—lyric interiority over plot twists—but execution is coherent. Could push 8.5+ with a bolder structural risk or sharper cultural specificity beyond generic academia.</comment>
