<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, tied to embodied stillness: “his spirit yearned to map…not of stone, but of resonance.” Contradictory impulses (brittle body vs. yearning spirit) coexist in-scene and power the climax. Final renunciation—becoming the still anchor—carries visible cost: “he did not rise…his weathered resolve had become the canyon’s new harmonic anchor.” Voice specificity and micro-choices hold; no stock label-speak. Hairline slip: “historically reverent to his marrow” leans toward diagnostic shorthand, but is instantly grounded by the arrowhead beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the flock weaves the bifurcated Pulse into unity while Corbin remains seated; cost is the lifelong paralysis now made purposeful. Causal chain: bird-schism → arrowhead vibration → still-point integration → canyon rhythm reset; every step is on-page and irreversible. Accumulative lens holds: dust, echo, and heartbeat layers tighten into a single cadence. No teleporting props; the arrowhead returns to the niche it came from, seeds the new compass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: bone towers act as resonance chambers, the fissure is a “pool of echoes,” dust is “layered…like forgotten prayers.” Micro-setting rules: the throne of fused pelvises physically constrains stillness; the arrowhead’s warmth is felt through bone. Final image—the arrowhead nested in the niche—reweights the entire canyon as a living tuning fork. Spatial choreography is flawless; birds dive and gyre without impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map without moving”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested by the schism. Escalation is a single deepening: the flock’s split forces Corbin to integrate rather than direct; options narrow to “become the bridge or lose the Pulse.” Cost is embodied: eternal stillness accepted when he nests the arrowhead and lets dust claim it. Under Accumulative lens the density increase (echo + heartbeat + breath) reweights the stake to sacred stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of stillness-as-action: navigation achieved by surrendering locomotion. Subtext carried in image—dust settling “around his feet”—implies time’s surrender to the unmoving anchor. No moralizing; the final rhythm is felt, not stated. Resonance re-weights earlier dust layers as “sacred pages” now legible to any who listen without feet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is ancient-mapper cadence: long sentences that spiral like echo-waves, then snap-short “He did not rise.” Lexicon stays canyon-bound: “knapped,” “tusk-spired,” “gyre.” Perceptual signature filters every sense through resonance—temperature of flint, color-shift of feathers with sound. No POV slippage; compression in peak beat (“A deep thrum…light chime”) is taught by prior echo mechanics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence adds layer or cadence. Figurative control: bone towers “vast as cathedrals” is single comparison, not chain. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (arrowhead warms, dust settles). High information density: one sentence can adverbially compress time (“Through centuries…”) while advancing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—stillness-as-navigation via harmonic ornithology—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: entire plot hinges on bird choreography, yet pattern is taught early (“whispers layered through centuries”) so closure feels earned, not gimmick. Synthesizes paleo-ritual, acoustic physics, and interior cartography into singular myth. Specificity of fused-pelvis throne and flint etchings prevents trope drift.</comment>
