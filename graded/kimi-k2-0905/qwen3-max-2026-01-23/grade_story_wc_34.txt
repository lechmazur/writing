<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—giving voice to the voiceless—is stated lyrically but never tested or contradicted; she undergoes no interior friction, cost, or shift. The flower-press bolt plate is handled, yet its emotional history stays abstract; no micro-choice risks failure or reveals a blind spot. Because the piece is purely observational, she remains a luminous vessel rather than a flawed agent whose limits compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard hums with latent meaning, rain will erase the surface yet the code persists—cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each carved symbol layers density until the final circle reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. A single tightening suffices for this length, and it delivers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The misty aerie is evoked with selective, sensory detail (vapor like liquid pearl, stone benches) that mirrors Elara’s hush. Micro-setting works: the damp flagstone’s texture guides the carving action and the lightning–thunder interval supplies a live clock. While the broader city remains a postcard, the courtyard’s immediacy constrains every beat; the bolt plate itself functions as charged object-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—articulate unspoken needs—but never sharpen into a specific risk or forfeiture; no symbol risks mis-carving, discovery, or personal loss. Pressure is atmospheric (storm window) rather than tactical; the sequence accumulates images without narrowing options. Cost is deferred to the conceptual realm, satisfying the lens yet limiting visceral escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—art as silent communion—emerges through the accumulating graffiti glyphs rather than exposition. The final image of rain washing stone yet leaving a “permanent whisper” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext resides in the unspoken recognition felt by distant strangers, though the absence of a lived counter-argument keeps complexity shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: synesthetic phrasing (“tinkersong wonder,” “liquid pearl”) is consistent and patterned early. Rhythm modulates with the carving beats, compressing during strikes then widening into reflective cadences. No head-hop; diction remains within a balladeer’s poetic lexicon. A few lyrical reach phrases (“ghostly outlines of long-pressed violets”) flirt with excess but stay legible under the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; most sentences perform double duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked modifiers (“tinkersong wonder—a fusion of artisan’s pride and awe…”) slow the beat without muddling causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar the closing lines. Strong read-aloud rhythm supports the incantatory intent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lightning-cipher conceit freshens the “secret artist” trope; coupling a flower-press bolt plate with stone etching is specific and memorable. Yet the arc is essentially a montage of successful execution—no failed glyph, no discovery, no paradox unearthed—so risk stays moderate. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight but not boldly destabilizing.</comment>
