<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and particular; the burnt feather as tactile memory and tool embodies contradiction between loss and guidance. Motivation stays legible and intensifies toward the dawn release. Micro-choice of releasing the feather crystallizes earned renunciation. Could edge higher if one more intermediate choice had risked tangible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: releasing the feather reconfigures belonging from search to practice with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light-in-dark images crescendos in sunrise/firefly overlay. Orientation anchored by word 50; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint—crack in dome—shapes final ascent and release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater facility, bioluminescent anemones, and cracked dome constrain movement and enable the final breach; every descriptive stroke either limits or affords Elara’s next action. Micro-settings—sextant, burnt feather, viewport—function as extensions of body and choice. Sensory hierarchy favors celestial and aquatic lights filtered through astrologer bias. Final image of liquid gold horizon is inseparable from closure meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens from abstract longing to practiced witnessing; dawn clock supplies external pressure. Single meaningful deepening occurs when hairline crack redirects her climb, foreclosing passive vigil. Cost is the relinquishing of the last relic, felt on-page. One-step escalation suffices for lyric/accumulative design; could use slightly sharper intermediate trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of light-stitching-dark images; final release converts loss into continuum without moralizing. Firefly memory reweights earlier burnt-feather grief, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity survives: belonging remains practiced, not possessed. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every image through astrological and marine lexicon. Rhythm modulates from slow underwater cadence to brighter, shorter pulses at sunrise. No head-hopping; diction stays within lexicon of self-taught stellar cartographer. Distinct syntactic texture—long breathy sentences punctuated by single-word perceptions—mirrors pressure shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). Sparse figurative language avoids purple overload; only two consecutive metaphors appear, pattern-taught via “shadowseam.” No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” conceptually heavy—does not occur in peak beat. High density maintained without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of landscape astrology with drowned city feels inevitable; burnt-feather star charts offer fresh praxis. Firefly covenant repurposed from nostalgic trope into ontological hinge. Risk of lyrical excess is embraced yet disciplined within 740 words. Specificity of plankton-ink constellations makes concept un-portable; removal would collapse narrative logic.</comment>
