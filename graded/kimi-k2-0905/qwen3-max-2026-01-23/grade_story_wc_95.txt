<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “diplomatically fierce” trait is dramatized once—welcoming the wind’s chaos as data—but otherwise told, not embodied. The mechanical arm is vivid texture; it never complicates or costs her anything. Interiority is lush yet generic; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Closure choice is foregone; the decoded invitation re-orients her mood without foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each needle alignment thickens pattern until the phrase crystallizes, a clean CR. Anchors land by line 5; orientation never wavers. Single tightening beat at needle #7 → “confluence” re-weights the stake; cost is conceptual—tomorrow’s vulnerability of open-handed collaboration. No因果 breaks; wind micro-turn integrates as data, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, half-painted sundial filter through Elara’s precision gaze; light angles couple directly to decoding task. Micro-setting triumph: sewing card’s Nordic embossing becomes star-map, constraining finger placement to micron tolerance. Spatial logic tight—no floating props. Wind gust is only environmental feedback that alters tactic, earning 9-band gate pass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she decipher before sun shifts?”—signals early; each aligned needle tightens the pattern, raising conceptual cost of failure. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative density. Wind complication is absorbed, not defeated, keeping agency internal. Final price: surrender of rhetorical armor for sunrise collaboration, legible as earned risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—fusion of empirical rigor with reverent openness—emerges through decoding action, not lecture. Sundial’s fractured shadow → unified beam mirrors internal reconfiguration. Final phrase “begin anew with open hands” lands as CR, not moral. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity of “confluence” lingers, inviting re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains philosopher’s perceptual signature: light as liquid gold, brook’s syllogistic murmur, gyroscopic diction. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Rhythm modulates—long luminist sentences breathe, then compress to needle-click staccato. Register stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Voice distinct enough to forego dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences carry double duty—sensory + conceptual. Occasional luxuriant stacks (“liquid gold upon flagstones smoothed by centuries”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative texture. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor nominalization drift (“reverence’s shore”) keeps it below 8-band purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing dueling philosophy with sundial cryptography feels fresh; sewing-card star-map is lovely specificity. “Diplomatically fierce” as epistemic martial art avoids swashbuckling cliché. Risk-taking lies in lyric stillness rather than plot twist; coherence survives. Could swap Copenhagen mentor for any city without structural damage—caps score.</comment>
