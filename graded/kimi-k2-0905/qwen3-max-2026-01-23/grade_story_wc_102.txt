<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—breath, scent, warmth of Kwan Yin’s tear—but the contradiction that would force a visible gamble is missing; she never risks anything tangible, so the “cost” is purely lyrical. Micro-choices (tilting the crystal, exhaling) are present yet interchangeable; any could be swapped without altering outcome. Still, the voice-specific noticing and the final stance shift feel earned within the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reservoir dissolves, her breath re-weights the premise—unused love is potential, not debt—conceptual cost is unmistakable in the final image (“breath a quiet prayer”). Pattern is taught early (each exhale alters the obscura image), held to last line. One soft spot: the sailor memory is floated twice but never re-prices the present action, so the causality hinge is slightly loose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viaduct, blooms, moss, crystal aperture—each detail is filtered through Elara’s light-language and constrains how she can act (only through breath, only via the lens). Spatial track is clean: railing → crevice → stone heart → descent. Missing a 9+ only because the environment never fights back; it yields too gently, muting constraint at the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightens through breath-made-visible pattern; the deepening is the moment the map appears and she must choose release. Price is lyrical rather than material, but still legible: the stored love leaves the stone and enters her, altering her future vocation. One escalation beat suffices under the accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: love withheld is not waste but seed, awaiting compassionate witness. Final image re-weights every prior spark and blossom. Dockside memory could have supplied counter-readings yet remains inert, preventing a higher band. Still, the conceptual repricing feels earned and non-moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—light inverted, scent catalogued, breath metered—and syntax lengthens/shortens with inhale/exhale rhythm. No head-hop; unreliability never claimed. Lyric diction stays within a plausible artist’s lexicon; purposeful near-repetition (“breath a quiet prayer”) pays off the pattern. Voice control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no filter-verb stacks; sentences advance at least two jobs (image + motion, scent + memory cue). Figurative load is high but patterned and paid off. One clause edges purple (“lavish cascades”) yet doesn’t occlude causality. Closure line is crystalline, no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Camera obscura as healing instrument feels fresh; sparks-as-pilgrimage-route and breath-as-key are non-obvious syntheses. Transformation test passes: remove the aquamarine tear or the inverted optics and the entire logic collapses. Dock regret is the only near-trope, but its function is structural, not ornamental. Risk stays embedded in concept, not gimmick.</comment>
