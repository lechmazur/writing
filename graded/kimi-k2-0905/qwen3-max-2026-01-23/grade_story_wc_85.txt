<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Elias’s guilt is rendered through concrete sensory anchors (snagged thumb, splinters) and a single irrevocable micro-choice—clutching the watch-hand carving—making his dawn vow credible. Interiority sometimes drifts into packaged phrases (“tempered regret, cool and sharp…”) that blunt contradiction. The arc from complicit silencer to self-accusing truth-teller is legible, yet the beat of actually confessing is deferred off-page, so the cost is prospective rather than embodied now.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s decision to speak at dawn forecloses the path of continued erasure and carries undeniable relational cost. Causal chain holds—driftwood find → recovered memory → renunciation—tightened under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleported props. One softness: the “suppressed letter” is introduced retrospectively, a mild retroactive patch that keeps the score from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tiles, salt-stung dusk, and the splintered watch-hand carving filter every beat through Elias’s tactile guilt; the terrace finally reframes from “monument to failure” to “threshold,” directly charging the final image. Selective sensory triangulation (sound of waves, rough wood, visual bleed of blue) keeps the micro-setting vivid without checklist bloat. Environment never forces a tactical constraint, so it stops just outside the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—return the withheld truth—remains coherent; pressure intensifies when the carving resurrects the pocket-watch forgery, crystallizing the cost of continued silence. One meaningful deepening suffices for the length. Because Elias’s final action is deferred to dawn, the price is promised rather than immediately paid, capping entry to the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: manufactured comfort is violence against the bereaved’s right to grieve. The watch-hand’s return reweights “sieved hush” from therapeutic balm to ethical obligation. No overt thesis statements; the closing image of the terrace as “grace” offers Charged Poise without moralizing. Complexity is honored—Elias neither excuses nor self-pardons.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors maritime erosion metaphors that suit a shore-bound genealogist. Syntax breathes—long cadences for surf-like rumination, clipped fragments at the cut. No dialogue to test, but interior monologue avoids therapeutic label-speak. Voice distinctiveness could sharpen further with idiosyncratic diction specific to black-market forgery craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally sleek, but recurrent “weight of unspoken words” and “sieved hush” refrains edge toward template cadence; the轻度 repetition dulls the final third without obscuring causality. Metaphors stay coherent (tiles/temperature = regret). High information density; no scaffold sentences. One mixed image: “tiles drank the fading light” is vivid yet anthropomorphic—minor, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Forging heroic memories for mourners is fresh territory; linking it to driftwood divination gives tactile originality. The pocket-watch hand as both authenticator and conscience talisman transforms a familiar symbol. Conceptual risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than twist—but the synthesis feels particular to Elias. Does not quite reach startling inversion, hence stays south of 8.5.</comment>
