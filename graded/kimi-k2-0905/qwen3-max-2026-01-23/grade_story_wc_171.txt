<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—gentle ritualist vs. burning commander—simultaneously press every beat; the public confession is an embodied micro-choice that costs his post and forecloses return, paying the redemption price on the page. Interiority is concrete (“clipboard felt…cooled obsidian”) and never drifts into label-speak. The elder’s fist unclenching shows relationship crucible altering state under his gentle pressure. Only lack of secondary-character interiority keeps it just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: Kaelen’s signed resignation and departure crystallize a before/after under the Causal lens—because he admits the Vale burning, therefore the treaty can live without his shadow. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 60 words; moonrise gives a live clock. The persistent constraint—“peace must grow without him”—is visible in the final image of him walking away. Cost is unmistakable: surrender of status and narrative identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The terrace’s sun-bleached limestone, midsummer heat-waves, and ancestor-altar constrain choreography and ritual timing; the ebony clipboard (micro-setting) literally bears the treaty and the memory of the last peace tree, charging the final signature image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Kaelen notices heat, stone age, and delegate spittle in order of threat. Spatial tracking is clean across the terrace and altar. Environment does not merely backdrop; it ritualizes the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Kaelen convert personal guilt into viable peace—tightens when his confession narrows options from negotiation to self-exile; this single deepening satisfies Causal escalation. Pressure is coherent: every delegate scoff or spit tests his gentle attribute. Renunciation costs his post and legacy, a visible price. Conflict never loops; each beat either corroborates or challenges the ritual’s credibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: a war-wood clipboard and twin-moon alignment reweight “redemption” as absence, not absolution. Subtext lives in gesture—the elder’s unclenching fist, the shared glance at moons—never in exposition. Final image of cracked terrace holding steady offers a non-literal answer: flawed beauty is the practice, not the ideal. No moralizing statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kaelen’s perceptual filter; diction (“operative gentleness,” “ash older than the war”) is character-specific and rhythmically controlled. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: “You offer your absence as proof?” carries status shift and mistrust. register matches a battle-weary commander turned penitent monk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “each step a prayer on stone older than the war” performs scene work while remaining lyrical. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; sentence lengths modulate with emotional crest. Metaphors are coherent (obsidian, dark flowers) and do not invade high-pressure beats. Only one near-purple line—“beauty existed in the trying”—slightly softens climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusing ritual anthropology with personal war-crime confession feels fresh; the clipboard-as-relic and peace-through-departure invert standard redemption arcs. Specificity of solstice twin moons and Vale burning grounds the concept so it could not swap names/places unchanged. Risk is present—renunciation instead of heroic victory—yet coherence never falters. A hair more world-level surprise could push 9-band.</comment>
