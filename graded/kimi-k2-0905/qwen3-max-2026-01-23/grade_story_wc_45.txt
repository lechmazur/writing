<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grieving mother vs. clinical bone-setter—remains concrete and embodied; the moment she spots the hairline cleft in the tooth is a micro-choice that re-weights her entire stance with visible cost (liberation/sob). Her “shrewd innocence” is shown, not told, through tactile handling of props and steady refusal to punish the village. One minor slip: “mistakes into constellations” drifts toward thesis-speak, but it is brief and quickly re-anchored in sensory action. Earned renunciation of vengeance lands under inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the tooth’s cleft re-weights folklore into illness, community fear into medical empathy, with undeniable social cost—she must now publicly realign the village. Causal chain holds: discovery of flaw → internal reversal → plan to teach → garden as star-map, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Cost is legible in the final image: burying the tooth as “first point of light.” No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) nailed by word 70.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop: dew-grass, willow-filtered light, and hedge maze constrain stealth and frame the tooth inspection. The secret garden’s micro-terrain (bench, rosemary beds) is mapped through Elara’s body as she plants future sage/lavilla rows—tools and soil become extensions of setting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a bone-setter notices texture, root lines, morning chill on aprons. Final image of sunlight gilding rosemary charges the closing beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara confirm or refute changeling myth—tightens once at the tooth reveal, foreclosing revenge and forcing public pedagogical risk. Escalation is accumulative: fear density → scientific evidence → communal confrontation, each increment raising social cost. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no off-stage rescue. Visible price: she forfeits private grief for public tutorial, stakes crystallized in “cartographer of grace” exit line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of folklore into pathology without moralizing. Constellation metaphor is re-priced at closure: star-map garden turns prior error into future navigation, answering the thematic question non-literally. Subtext resides in silent handling of the tooth—an act of love and defiance—rather than exposition. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance built from the specific cleft image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: medical attention to fracture planes, maternal synesthesia of nostalgia and botany. Syntax mirrors bone-setter precision—short diagnostic clauses under willow light, then longer planting sentences as she drafts the star-map. No head-hop; diction remains within rural healer’s lexicon. Filter verbs (“she recalled”) are minimal and voice-motivated, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “yearned for truth with a hollow ache deeper than any splintered bone” fuses concrete profession to emotion. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay orthopaedic or botanical. Rhythm modulates—staccato during tooth reveal, flowing as she plans garden. One scaffold pair: “She forgave their terror; it was human” could compress, but it does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling folktale × osteological diagnostics × maternal grief. Tooth-root cleft as epistemic smoking gun is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of sentimentality resisted via clinical gaze and communal, not private, resolution. Transformation test passes—plot collapses without bone-setter method and garden map.</comment>
