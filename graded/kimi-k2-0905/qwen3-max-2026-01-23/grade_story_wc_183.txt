<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyra’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals (mannequin, wildflowers) and the hollow is made physical; the renunciation of the card lands as earned because her earlier clinging has bled her. Interiority sometimes drifts toward abstract therapy-speak (“fundamental fracture in her own being”) which blunts the contradiction on the page. Still, the final keeper/gardener self-redefinition visibly costs her the card and the chase, so the arc pays.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the card reweights memory from pursuit to stewardship, cost is the literal loss of the only tether. Accumulative lens holds—each frayed thread intensifies the stakes of remembering wrongly until surrender is the only density shift left. Causality stays internal but coherent; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ship decay is filtered through Lyra’s joyful aberrance—whispering to headless mannequins, Ferris-wheel wildflowers—so setting guides her micro-choices rather than decorating. Fog functions as memory diffusion, mirroring narrative instability without overt symbolism. Spatial anchors hold; no impossible moves. The emerald card micro-setting charges the final image when it spirals away, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she haul Kael back or let him go?”—tightens once: the journal redefines the garden as internal, collapsing retrieval into release. Agency is renunciation rather than external battle, fitting situational lens. Cost is the card and the identity of seeker; visible on page. Could use one earlier material loss to sharpen tactics, but sufficient for 600-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture: surrendering the manufactured green thread = accepting impermanence of memory. No moralizing sentence; the cathedral-of-acceptance image reweights prior clutching without preaching. Subtext in mirror-hall laughter-turned-shatter and burnt-sugar ghost voices layers loss under carnival rot. Final whispered name lands as warm light, not thesis—resonant, ambiguous, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Lyra’s selective attention—she notices rusted joy, not practical escape routes. Syntax mirrors her lull: long cadences in fog, short tear-track release at end. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are sparse; perceptual signature stays consistent. One register spike—“unkindled solace” as concept—almost academic but justified because it’s the journal’s quoted phrase, so kept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical stems. A few soft loops—“memory altered” echoed three times in 80 words—dull propulsion slightly but do not touch closure. Figurative layering is controlled, not stacked. Strong information density: carnival shards double as emotional state. Would trim two adjectives (“mournful fog,” “sea-green eyes”) for diamond clarity, but line craft solid overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chimera-twin grief inside a derelict carnival ship is fresh amalgam; garden-of-names concept flips usual afterlife trope into internal cultivation. Surrender-via-color-swatch offers non-obvious closure image. Some phrasal echoes of McKillip-style lyric fantasy but sufficiently transmuted through rust-and-fog texture. Risk is present—quiet renunciation instead of rescue—yet coherence holds, giving a +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
