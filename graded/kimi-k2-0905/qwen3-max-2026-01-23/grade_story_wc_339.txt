<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s quietly analytic armor cracks only once—when the snow-globe blizzard models the physics of surrender he has hunted—and that micro-choice credibly flips his refusal to release Elara into an earned, costly stasis. Contradictory impulses (clinging vs. cataloguing viscosity) coexist in-scene, not in summary; the final image carries visible cost: the stone in his chest settles, foreclosing endless grief-recursion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the settling glitter reweights every prior knot of tape and memory with undeniable conceptual cost—he will converse with release, not defeat death. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tangled threads → untangled tape → settled snow steadily re-prices the stake; no causal turns are required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 30; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>The library itself—waterlogged shelves, ghostly anemones, mahogany desk—functions as micro-setting that literally cradles the snow-globe pivot object; spatial choreography tracks Thorne’s gloved hand, lamp beam, and tape spool without drift. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a professional diver’s priorities: viscosity, terminal velocity, salt-frazzled voice—never tourist-catalog. Environment constrains the final choice: only inside the dry submersible can the tape play, making the ascension inseparable from the setting’s pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he ever let Elara go?—is signaled by word 79 and tightens once: the restored transmission + snow-globe demonstration foreclose the option to keep grieving actively. Escalation is textural: each rescued inch of oxide-caked tape increases emotional density until the serene captain’s voice re-prices surrender. Cost is visible—he secures the globe as “quiet promise,” stone settles with soft finality—meeting the 8.8+ threshold for felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: surrender as physics, not theology—chaos dissipates under acceptance’s gentle pull. The snow globe’s final silence re-answers the opening abyssal quiet, reweighting grief into wisdom. Subtext operates in gesture (viscosity notes, gentle shake) rather than declaration; the reader is invited to feel rather than被告知.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanographer-precise, syntax trimmed like rebreather cadence; perceptual signature is unmistakably Thorne’s—he times breaths, clocks viscosity, catalogs particles. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within a scientist-plausible lexicon even at peak stress. Compression (“he noted viscosity, terminal velocity”) is patterned early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long silt-laden sentences to clipped surgical patience during untangling; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—glycerin seas, frozen stars—never muddies physics. Information density high: single sentences deliver dive depth, POV bias, and object placement simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing Earhart headlines with a drowned library via a snow-globe micro-cosm is a fresh, non-obvious angle on “letting go.” The physics-of-grief metaphor is synthesized through concrete particulars (viscosity, terminal velocity) rather than abstract declaration. Risk—quiet lyric ending in a salvage-dive context—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
