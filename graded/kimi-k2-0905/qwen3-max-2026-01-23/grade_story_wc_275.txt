<comment>Elara’s pacifism is embodied in daily micro-choices (barefoot walk, whispering to roses, deliberate sheathing) rather than labels; the father’s knife ritual dramatizes an internal contradiction that forecloses violence with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and sense-rooted (“thumb brushed rough patch,” “cool glass”); no diagnostic self-talk. The only soft spot is that the father’s legacy is referenced more than it is pressure-tested on the page; the conflict is mostly internal and static, so the arc edges toward renunciation rather than transformation under fire.</comment>

<comment>Cumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of salvaged fragments → cultivated blooms builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is cinematic and immediate; anchors (“glass dome,” “endless sands,” barefoot daughter) land by line 4. Closure is Earned Stasis: the deliberate sheathing and binding of the stem with the sandbag scrap visibly buries violence and forecloses the bounty-hunter path. Cost is felt—“the soft click of the sheathe was her daily vow”—but not paid in a new external loss, so it stops just short of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The dome-and-desert micro-setting is not backdrop; the sandbag scrap and glass walls materially constrain choices—she ties stems with literal wreckage, the sealed quiet shapes her hearing. Sensory hierarchy is biased and character-specific: Elara notices petal-unfurling chimes and silver thirst-hues, ignores machinery. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. Environment charges the final image: sunset refracts through both glass and rose, fusing setting and closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve nonviolent sanctuary—signaled early. Pressure is accumulative: each dawn the knife ritual re-enacts the temptation; the sandbag scrap literalizes consequence of past violence. One meaningful tightening: she binds the stem with the very fabric of her father’s crash, turning relic into life-support. Cost is present but already absorbed; no new option is foreclosed today, so escalation plateaus at contemplative rather than crucible level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: tower dust → salvaged scrap → knife sheathed → rose bound; violence recycled into nurture. No thematic statement is pronounced; the final image of light inside glass and bloom refracts the central question without moralizing. Repricing is conceptual: the blade’s purpose is rewritten, the desert’s harshness converted to fragrance. Ambiguity lingers—tomorrow the ritual must be repeated—so complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinctive—“senselessly perceptive,” “engraved quiet,” “tiny bell of renewal.” Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences mirror dome-hum, then compress into single-beat clauses at sheathing. No dialogue to test, but interior diction stays within a gardener-poet lexicon; no academic register drift. Free-indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is purposeful: anaphora (“she whispered… she pressed… she turned”) threads mantra-like continuity without机械 template. Metaphors are few, precise, and physically coherent—“teardrop of hope,” “tranquil blaze.” Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory data, emotional tilt, and symbolic freight. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pacifist gardener + bounty-hunter relic + acoustic-perception gift creates a non-obvious protagonist; the salvaged-ballast scrap as grafting ribbon is fresh and specific. Concept of “inculcating plants with values” risks abstract whimsy but is grounded in tactile garden labor, so it escapes gimmick. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not predictable. Slight deduction: the post-apocalyptic dome farm is familiar bones; novelty lies in Elara’s synesthetic husbandry rather than world-frame.</comment>
