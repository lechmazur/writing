<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s calm resolve is embodied through gesture and micro-choice (zigzag footwork, exhaling silence, driving the spike). Contradictory grief for her daughter surfaces only at the climax and is immediately offered, so the interior arc is legible but compressed. No head-count or status issues; single-POV holds. Final “remaking” is earned by prior causal use of silence and spike, satisfying cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vortex stills, echo enters her, world re-patterns—cost is the irreversible surrender of the quest itself and the internalized sorrow. Causal chain—silence absorbs chaos, spike grounds it, grief reweights path—holds start-to-finish. Accumulative lens governs; pattern break at the vortex reconfigures stakes cleanly. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound-garden rules stay consistent (C-major shards, liquid melody, thorny dissonance) and are learned through Elara’s body. Rail spike functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactic and charges the final image. Sensory triage narrows to touch and vibration under pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the zigzag leap to vortex.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch goddess echo—signaled in first paragraph; secondary grief stake braids at climax. Single meaningful tightening: driving spike into vortex forecloses capture and remakes her instead; price is surrender of original goal. Escalation is accumulative (density of broken harmonics) rather than causal reversal, fitting lens. Cost visible in cooling iron and permanent pulse of echo inside her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “mending through embracing brokenness” emerges via image pattern (shattered C-major → reassembled hopeful scale) rather than statement. Final silence-strike offers resonant non-literal answer: possession is replaced by permeability. No moralizing; ambiguity remains in what she will now carry. Grief and cosmic compassion interweave without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains cool, precise diction that mirrors Elara’s temperament; perceptual signature favors tactile vibration over visual spectacle. Rhythm modulates—long fluid sentences in calm, staccato fragments amid shattering chords—without losing coherence. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Spike-as-pen idiom stays within plausible ancestral lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Occasional adjective stacks (“rust-pitted relic,” “wild, untamed authority”) flirt with purple but serve cadence. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns and spatial tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Fisher of echoes” in a sonic crystal garden is fresh; rail-spike-as stylus converts industrial detritus into shamanic pen, avoiding generic magic wand. Constellation choreography feels genuinely dreamlike yet causal within lyric logic. Risk in voicing silence pays off as both tactic and thematic surrender. Could not swap spike or garden without collapsing narrative engine.</comment>
