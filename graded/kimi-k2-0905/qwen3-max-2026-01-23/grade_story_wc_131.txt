<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete, anchored in sensory memory and embodied ritual; her contradictory impulses—yearning for invisibility yet choreographing a dawn reveal—collide in the moment she steps into light. The micro-choice to place the fragment where the first sunbeam will strike is both methodical and vulnerably human, scaling cost to length. Evans’ recognition supplies external confirmation, but the earned change is Elara’s own renunciation of erasure. Minor skim: “quiet intensity” borders label-speak, but the body-of-action quickly re-anchors.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene causality is clean: outage → access → cache → dawn reveal; each beat tightens the next under a causal lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s full emergence reconfigures both women’s futures with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no debt. The sparrow-filed edge of the reel persists as a constraint that shapes placement and recognition, satisfying the persistent-price test.</comment>

<comment>Library is not backdrop but tool: the false panel, conduit texture, and sunbeam geometry constrain hiding and reveal tactics. Micro-objects—lemon-polish scent, knotted rope, chipped mug—carry memory and social history. Spatial choreography stays coherent across crawl space, history shelves, circulation desk. Environment charges closure: the same dust motes that open the piece ignite into gold at emergence, reweighting prior imagery.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s visibility gamble—tightens once: each preparatory move (prying drywall, descent, placement) forecloses retreat. Escalation is linear but felt; the outage functions as complication, not convenience. Cost is visible: twelve years of erasure risked in a single dawn moment. No reversal mid-scene, yet the final stance crystallizes with sufficient pressure for this length.</comment>

<comment>Theme of chosen visibility emerges through gesture, not thesis: the sparrow etching, dawn light, and shared sanctuary image reweight solitude as bridge. Subtext carries in silence—Evans’ tearful nod says more than exposition could. No moralizing; the final illumination is literal and figurative yet unparsed for the reader. Resonance lingers in the question of who else might be cached in other buildings.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: sound of “sapphire hush,” smell of cherry tobacco, iron conduit’s cold. Syntax lengthens during stealth, contracts at emergence, mirroring risk and release. No dialogue until Evans’ whispered “Arthur’s interview…,” a perfect breakage of silence. Voice modulation meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “dust motes hung suspended…into swirling gold” reprises without loop. Mixed metaphors avoided; “taffy” stretch of minutes is brief, apt. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mechanical data. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, climaxing in the short declarative “She was finally, beautifully, seen.”</comment>

<comment>Fusing outage, archival fragments, and crawl-space guardian feels fresh yet inevitable. Sparrow-filed reel edge is a specific, non-obvious token that cannot be swapped without breaking recognition logic. Risk taken: near-total silence and absence of antagonist, yet pressure holds through internal stakes. Slight lean on “lights flicker” as transition device keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
