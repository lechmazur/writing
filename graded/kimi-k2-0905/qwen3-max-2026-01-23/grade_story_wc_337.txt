<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—scarred fingers, salt-tinged breath, the needle as extension of self—yet the “broken mask restorer” identity is asserted, never embodied in scene. Contradictory impulses (need to heal vs. fear of fracture) are implied but not dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final self-repair is declared, not tested under fresh pressure. Still, her tactile precision and the tear-tracked cheeks supply enough embodied cost to earn the quiet turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty net under pooled starlight reconfigures both the sanctuary’s silence and Elara’s self-concept; the conceptual cost—she must now carry the woven grief as part of her own fabric—is unmistakable. Causality holds knot-by-knot; each freed strand tightens her interior options until the final surrender. One transition (entry → dais) is clean; orientation is anchored by prism-light on moss within 120 words. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary is not postcard backdrop: refracted starlight guides needle placement, salt-bleached hemp scratches skin, and the dais elevation dictates ritual choreography. The tapestry needle itself serves as micro-setting—its silver coolness anchoring every beat. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and sound (chime from prism) under the dominant visual, matching a restorer’s haptic attention. Final image of starlight pooling rather than fracturing reweights the entire spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quieting the spirits—tightens with each unraveled knot; the method itself is the pressure engine. One meaningful deepening: the daughter’s ribbon memory turns abstract grief into filial tether, narrowing Elara’s emotional options to personal identification. Cost is cumulative silence that finally swells into wave-of-peace; the price is her own unrest absorbed rather than expelled. No reversal, but accumulative lens legitimates the single intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—restoration as integration of fracture—emerges through net imagery and silence texture; no character moralizes. The ribbon and final apprentice sacrifice reprice “broken” from flaw to record of love. Subtext resides in hush thickening like frost: unspoken grief made material. Final image avoids platitude, offering resonance instead of resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: prism-light “fractures,” hemp is “salt-bleached,” silence “thickens”—all sensory verbs she would choose. Syntax lengthens during unraveling, then shortens at surrender, mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One lyrical compression—“whispers coiled like smoke”—is pattern-taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for knot-work, clipped fragments at climax. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (frost-silence, river-light) stay coherent and physically grounded. Only minor density spike—“silent rivers of sapphire and silver”—but it serves atmospheric calibration, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fisherman’s net as memory prison feels fresh; tapestry needle repurposed for unraveling rather than mending inverts expected tool use. Prism sanctuary refracts both light and grief, a spatial metaphor not previously overworked. Risk lies in quiet ending without external antagonist, but accumulative structure makes it earned rather than evasive. Could swap fisherman archetype for more specific regional detail to reach top band.</comment>
