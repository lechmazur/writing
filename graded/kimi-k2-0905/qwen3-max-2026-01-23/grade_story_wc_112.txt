<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet obsession and mechanical competence are credibly embodied; the final silent communion with the zephyrs shows earned renunciation of pride in favor of listening. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of doubt before lever-pull is slightly under-dramatized—an extra contradictory impulse in that beat would have secured 9+. Character-bound knowledge holds; no label-speak. Closure cost is felt in the shift from proof to reverence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael builds the device in secret and pulls the lever, time branches are revealed, forcing a permanent stance change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise—he forecloses the “straight road” of linear time and accepts sideways breath with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Persistent constraint: tomorrow he still fixes drones, but under reweighted perception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alien ridge, hangar bay, and magnetic nexus are selectively sketched; twilight shimmer and thermal-suit crackle constrain timing and action. The nexus projector recurs as micro-setting that charges the final lattice image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Detail economy favors pressure—world rules learned through Kael’s hands, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is signaled early and tested by the one-shot lever pull that cannot be undone. Escalation is single but meaningful: the lattice appears, foreclosing linear certainty and exposing him to cosmic scale. Visible price: frozen tears, trembling hands, tomorrow’s unchanged labor under new knowledge. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal/epistemic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mechanical control and temporal humility; no moral is stated. The zephyrs’ sideways migration reweights from mystery to shared grammar without thematic echo lines. Final image of “universe infinitely kinder” lands as Conceptual Repricing—kindness now means nonlinear acceptance, not mastery. Ambiguity lingers: proof is replaced by listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature—copper scent, lubricant stains, twilight shimmer. Prose modulates from short mechanic cadences to lyrical lattice reveal without register drift. No head-hopping; Aris’s wonder is shown externally. Free-indirect “time moves sideways” is cleanly filtered through his lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Density high—thermal suit crackle doubles as body and weather; lattice strands replace light show cliché. No mixed metaphors at climax. One passive—“time unveiled itself”—is purposive. Copy clean; no homophones. Final line cadence mirrors earlier “mechanically warm” refrain, recharging it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sideways time via zephyr migration feels fresh, not bootstrap paradox cliché. Integration of holographic mechanics with sacred canyon nexus synthesizes hard-SF and numinous without gimmickry. Risk: quiet closure could have deflated; instead it reweights. Transformation test fails if swapped to linear time—proof the angle is specific.</comment>
