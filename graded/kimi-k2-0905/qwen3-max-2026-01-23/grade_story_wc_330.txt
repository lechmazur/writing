<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s silence-turned-song is embodied every beat: carpenter’s fingers sifting sawdust, voice cracking alive under stained-glass light. The memory of Lily is concrete cue, not label, and the final smile is earned cost. Interior contradiction—“silence as possibility” versus the terror of sound—drives every micro-choice. One decimal off only because the 12-year muteness recovery is telescoped into a single breath.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mud-slide wrong turn → ghost train → halo fragment → sung repair: each because/therefore linkage is tight, irreversible. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the circlet clicks whole only after voice is risked, so cost is visible in the same sentence. The landslide is coincidence that complicates, not resolves; final image reweights the premise—silence is no longer void but fertile. No teleporting props or unmotivated knowledge leaks.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coastal highway, misting hush, rusted crimson train, wind-bell ivy: every sensory pick is filtered through Elara’s carpenter eye, not tourism. The stained-glass dome fractures light that literally guides her hand to the missing brass sliver; environment constrains the final repair. Micro-setting—the horse’s walnut flank under her palm—functions as crucible for the sung resurrection. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms.

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is voiced early: “interpret silence as possibility.” Pressure tightens once—she must break twelve years of muteness to mend the halo and, symbolically, Lily. The song is the irreversible trade-off; success costs the safety of silence forever. Cost is on-page: voice “wavered then strengthened,” eyes “genuine, unforced light.” No antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices and is paid in full.

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of silence: absence becomes generative medium. The whispering gleam reweights the concept—quiet is no longer emptiness but canvas—without a moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture: placing the brass sliver is an act of parenting the memory of Lily. Final image of sun-dappled valley is Conceptual Repricing that makes silence’s value undeniable.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s carpenter perception: wood grain, chisel syntax, sea-glass timbre of wind bells. Rhythm swells with the song—sentence length elongates, then contracts at the click of the halo. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Diction remains within plausible lexicon of a craftsperson; no academic register creep.

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is musical yet disciplined; figurative language peaks at the song beat and recedes, avoiding density overload. Only minor scaffold: “misting hush” is repeated three times with near-synonym drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or causality. Clause order stays sequential, no simultaneity errors.

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train carved inside a forest womb is fresh stage, yet the real invention is treating silence as a woodworking material to be planed into song. The halo fragment’s brass-whisper声学 is particular to this world. Risk is taken—twelve-year muteness broken in a single breath—but causality supports it via accumulative texture. Could edge higher if the landslide trigger had been seeded earlier.
