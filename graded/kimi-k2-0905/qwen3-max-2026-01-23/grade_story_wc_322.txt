<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s through-line—“what does connection feel like?”—is clear and embodied early. However, her internal contradictions are summarized (fever dream memory vs rational architect) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice until the thread erupts; the pivot to humility is credible but the on-page cost is a single kneel-and-tear gesture, slightly under-scaled for the claimed cataclysm. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Interiority vivid, but “catharsis” is named rather than shown through body. Meets basic change test but not the high-band simultaneous contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of memory-fragments increases until the gallery’s rules rupture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—gallery reborn with “sacred resonance,” Elara’s stance shifted to consent-based weaving; cost is the scattering of her former method and the tear-tracked cheek. Orientation clean by 120 words; causal linkage slack (no clear why the eruption happens now), but pattern holds. One meaningful tightening lands. Sufficient for publishable tier, though not a decisive causal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gallery plus sinew thread function as micro-setting: shifting walls and pulsing filament directly constrain her weaving choices. Crystalline apertures, river of time—selective sensory triad keeps focus tight. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies. Object-state changes (thread glow → scatter) feed back into action. Environment charges the final image of kneeling amid hum. Meets 9- gate: setting alters tactics and charges closure; missing top band only because one metaphor (“forests of forgotten promises”) edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs reverence for connection—signaled early. Escalation via density spike: illusions rupture into real memories, forcing renunciation of her controlling method. Agency present (she tries to reinforce, then gathers threads in new spirit). Cost visible (thread autonomy, tear, scattered loom). No coincidence resolution. Sufficient tightening for 600-word form; could edge higher if a prior failed attempt had foreshadowed the eruption rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: “connection is living tapestry not specimen.” Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in thread behavior (autonomy = demand for consent). Avoids tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers whether new weaves will hold. No thesis statement in last paragraph. Minor echo of “texture of connection” phrase counts as early prompt seed, not intrusive moral. Sufficient resonance for high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush, lyric third-person adheres to Elara’s perceptual bias—light, math, filament. Syntax lengthens during calm, fragments under rupture: “Not with fire, but with essence:” punch list of memories. No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs (“she felt”) appear but serve fever-dream lens. Dialogue absent, so dialogue bullets skipped. Rhythm control evident; near 9- except one stock cadence run (“the… the… the…” memory list) mildly flattens peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong noun/verb choices (“sunlight fractured,” “thread jerked taut”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture. Figurative density high but pattern-taught (optical illusion grammar) and paid off. One mixed metaphor edge—“river of flowing time, thick with the scent of old paper”—slight coherence wobble. No scaffold sentences. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns. Final line lands quietly without overwriting. Top-band blocked only by that single metaphor muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses math-optics with emotion-fiber craft; not a trope stack but organic synthesis. Memory-eruption twist grows from accumulative logic rather than late gimmick. Specific detail (“mathematically precise grace,” “sinew thread cool and faintly pulsing”) keeps concept embodied. Transformation test: swap gallery → lab or thread → wire and the arc collapses. Risky lyric density mostly succeeds. Slight familiarity of “kneel-and-cry” closure image holds it sub-9.</comment>
