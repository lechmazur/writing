<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation—conquer fear by exposing its weakness—remains steady and sharp; interiority is concrete (“shards of ice in his throat”). Yet the advisor’s contradictory impulses (need to dominate vs. offer his own emptiness) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat, and the cost of his final gift—trading cursed void for human outline—feels lightly earned because the story never shows him fearing that loss. Still, the renunciation is legible and character-bound, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each micro-choice (reading paradox, forcing the teddy-bear lie, offering his mirror-null image) tightens the noose around the antagonist and precipitates its confession. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—advisor regains reflection, fear dissolves—paid for by the advisor’s surrender of his protective emptiness; cost is visible in the mirror shard. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity. One causal leap: the dictionary’s final paradox appears only at climax, but because the advisor has already used prior notes, the insertion reads as culmination rather than contrivance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Funhouse is rendered through advisor’s body (cold fingers, choked sob) and tool (clasp glow revealing dust motes). Selective sensory triage—sweet rot vs. blood, nails-on-glass voice—keeps pressure high. Spatial choreography is clean: hallway of mirrors, one warped pane singled out, bear corner located. Setting constrains the final choice: only the mirror-null image can serve as bait, fusing environment to tactic and earning the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—force fear to confess its weakness—escalates through three advisor gambits, each narrowing his margin (dictionary quote → teddy-bear lie → self-offering). The entity’s shrieked resistance and final tremor make cost audible. Advisor’s persistent agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Price—loss of cursed invisibility—lands on-page, though the pain of becoming visible is named rather than felt, keeping the score just below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—fear’s power collapses when witnessed without terror—emerges entirely through event and image (mirror void → restored outline). Subtext lives in the advisor’s gentle questioning that masks a scalpel. Final image reframes funhouse from dread-site to “gentle silence,” a conceptual repricing that costs the advisor his shield. No moralizing; resonance is earned. Ambiguity remains: will he now fear being seen? The refusal to answer keeps the score from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to advisor’s perceptual filter: rust taste, coin-cold fingers, selective attention to glow and rot. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into whispers, mirroring tension. Diction—“unbosom,” “repulsive allure”—feels idiosyncratic yet consistent with an arcane mind. No head-hop; psychic distance control precise. Voice modulation under pressure is evident, meeting the 9− quick test, though a few adjective stacks (“repulsive allure of decay”) flirt with purple, capping at 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with beats. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light, coins, smoke—teaching early and paying off in dissolution image. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. One paraphrase loop (“lingering luminance… faint, persistent glow”) and two filter verbs (“seemed to writhe”) slightly dull immediacy, invoking −0.3. Artifacts do not touch closure; final line is clean. Density and propulsion remain high, warranting the 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Core combo—photo-cursed man vs. mirror-fear—feels fresh, and the inversion that fear dreads being seen is non-obvious. Trope of haunted carnival is transformed through advisor’s scholarly tool (dream dictionary) and paradoxical rhetoric rather than gore. Specificity of opera-clasp glow guiding reveal keeps premise from feeling generic. Risk in quiet dissolution rather than explosive banishment heightens coherence. No close echoes of famous scenes. Slight safety in teddy-bear symbol keeps it from the 9-tier.</comment>
