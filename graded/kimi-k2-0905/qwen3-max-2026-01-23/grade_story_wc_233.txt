<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is concrete—her “quiet erosion” and the climb as shedding duty—and the final renunciation of disenchantment is earned by the grotto vision. The silver fox functions as pressure, not just symbol, forcing the micro-choice of shared breath. Only flaw: the queen’s “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than embodied until the final line, slightly underpaying the setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bleeding starlight reweights her rule, with felt cost—“starlight in her veins” carries the mountain’s cold price. Causal chain holds: obsidian warning → climb → fox truce → grotto → insight → return. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One shard, one transition (descent), valid under Track A.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain spine, dew-slick ledge, obsidian altar—each detail is tactile and filters through Lyra’s fatigue and priority. Cobalt/azurite veins literally guide her gaze and steps, integrating description into action. Final image of rose-gold clouds re-codes the earlier lacy menace into fragile sovereignty, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mend the tear within herself or all light fades”—tightens at the ledge when the fox stare costs her breath and secrecy. Escalation is accumulative: each upward yard strips one layer of ceremonial armor, narrowing her options until the grotto confrontation. Cost is visible: discarded cloak, thinning air, bleeding starlight drunk by obsidian—material prices paid on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific inversion: celestial wound → sovereign neglect → shared ember tending. No explicit moral; the final image of fireflies in daylight re-prices the “lacy menace” as fragile covenant. Subtext in the fox’s slow exhale silently judges her prior absence. Avoids tidy binaries—beauty and peril entwined—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; diction (“star-forged purpose,” “ceremonial artifice”) stays inside a monarch’s lexicon. Rhythm swells with ascent, then fractures into shorter clauses at the summit, mirroring oxygen debt. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful (“she understood then”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent—starlight as blood, embers as heartbeat—never mixed. One paraphrase loop: “quiet erosion, a hollowing of spirit” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. Information density high; single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy ascent trope is re-cast as interior audit; grotto not as treasure vault but living mirror of civic neglect. Fox-as-psychopomp trope subverted by mutual recognition rather than guidance. Fresh inflection: sovereign’s epiphany is that her own withdrawal, not external curse, bleeds the sky. Risk in lyric compression pays off—closure image would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
