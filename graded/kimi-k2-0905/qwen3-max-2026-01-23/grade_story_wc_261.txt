<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her “quiet obsession,” the way she maps coffee rings, her tactile focus on bandage and sheet. The flaw (re-opening wounds) is dramatized through the coffee-ring beat and the climactic renunciation of that habit, so change carries cost. No contradictory impulses share a beat; emotion is embodied but not yet rawly conflicted under peak pressure. Fits 8.0; nudge toward 8.5+ would need one more layered contradiction voiced in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images (hourglass, ring, root-tunnel) accrete meaning until the final crystallization reweights scars as tunnels. Causal chain is present—fern memory → root vision → renunciation—but subordinate to pattern-deepening. Closure is a Charged Poise: she forecloses the “re-open” tactic and accepts telepathy with quiet, felt cost (“tear traced,” palm over bandage). Orientation is clear by line 25, stakes tighten once, cost visible on final beat—meets 8.8 bar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass, chipped mug, potted fern, olive outside—each recurs and constrains perception or choice. Body-as-setting (bandage, stitches) directly limits her forward lean over the ring. Selective sensory triage matches post-surgical fog; no filler cataloguing. Micro-objects charge the final image; meets 9.0 gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep prying wounds open?—is signaled early. Single tightening occurs when the root-tunnel vision reframes scar-as-pathway, forcing renunciation. Cost is legible (loss of old investigative method, acceptance of alien telepathy). Escalation is modest—one accretive turn, not a causal squeeze—so stays below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of tunnels, rings, roots: stories aren’t extracted, they’re witnessed. No character sermonizes; the hourglass’s last clear gleam reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—telepathy is unsettling yet miracle. Quiet resonance lands cleanly; only the coffee-ring epiphany line flirts with overt statement, limiting 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric idiom matches Elara’s medical/scientific tilt—“evaporative patterns,” “fractal lacework”—while staying sense-bound. Rhythm modulates: long anaesthetic sentences contract to clipped final declarations. No head-hop; perceptual filter consistent. Minor cadence repetition (“she had…” ×3) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong information density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are mixed once (“meteor hush… physical presence… weight of waiting stars”) but do not tangle causality. Scaffolding nearly absent; only faint paraphrase loop on “displaced miracle” phrase. Closure line is clean; meets high-band bar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-surgical plant telepathy framed as unwanted side-effect is fresh; link to buried acorn tunnel feels inevitable in hindsight. Coffee-ring cartography and anesthesia hourglass give tactile novelty. Conceptual blend of scar → tunnel → miracle avoids genre cliché. Risk is moderate; transformation visible yet still resembles literary-magic-realist template, capping below 8.5.</comment>
