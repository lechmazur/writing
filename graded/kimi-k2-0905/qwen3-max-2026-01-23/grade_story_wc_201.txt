<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“muscles coiling,” “breath hitched”—but the self-diagnosed “trauma-response” label intrudes with textbook distance in the very beats meant to show collapse. Contradictory impulses (flinch vs. deliberate recall) co-exist in scene, and the final smile is credibly earned by the causal chain of micro-memories. Still, the daughter laugh beat arrives as a single image without prior seed, so the cost feels slightly imported, not compounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the strap becomes compass, the equation reframes pain into pattern, and the cost—perpetual exile under UV light—is legible in the final walk. Accumulative lens holds: each triggered memory deepens the mercy datum instead of changing external options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“pine needles beneath his back”) so no penalty. One minor causality slack: the nurse-tenderness unlocks without prior narrative presence, but it tightens the Fibonacci pattern immediately after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>UV forest is no postcard: fractal bark glyphs and mycelial light constrain perception and directly feed the mercy theorem. Body-as-setting (proprioceptive micro-mapping) doubles as environmental constraint that determines every cautious step. Final image re-uses the strap under UV glow, meeting the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “mossy stone” is generic against the invented indigo spectrum, but the micro-tremor in thigh rescues specificity in the same phrase.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quantify mercy or remain haunted—tightens through each mined memory: hesitation coefficient → kindness integer → recursive love function. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the internal requirement to solve before movement becomes impossible. Visible price: every braced flinch costs physical stamina and social connection (“ghost haunting society’s edges”). Escalation obeys Accumulative logic: density of data, not narrowing options, but the stakes still feel higher because failure means eternal self-exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated images—strap, glyphs, Fibonacci—rather than any statement; mathematics is lived, not lectured. Final “compass” re-prices the strap from torture relic to navigational tool, reweighting all prior horror into usable pattern. Ambiguity survives: mercy equation may never balance, so complexity is honored. No moralizing line survives; closest—“mercy = Σ (small kindnesses) / (opportunity for cruelty)”—is presented as whispered hypothesis, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a scientist-poet hybrid: precise diction (“proprioceptively enhanced,” “Mercy_Coefficient_01”) yet rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence. Perceptual signature is relentless quantification of bodily micro-data, never slipping into external interpretation. No head-hop; UV perception stays anchored to Kael. Under stress, syntax compresses—“he brace”—a taught fragment that pays off repeatedly. Register remains consistent; no sudden academic intrusion that isn’t his.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from crystalline short shocks to longer accumulative clauses, sustaining momentum. Figurative language is selective—mycelial compassion—and never stacks into purple. No paraphrase loops; each sensory hit adds new datum to the theorem. One negligible scaffold: “silent significance” could be cut, but it occupies a low-pressure line and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: trauma-survivor-turned-mathematician seeks axioms of mercy via UV synesthesia—high-concept yet emotionally grounded. Fractal bark and mycelial networks transform familiar forest into cognitive lab without slipping into sci-fi cliché. Risk of interior recursion is embraced and paid off by the final compass image. Premise is inseparable from this character and place; swap any element and the equation collapses.</comment>
