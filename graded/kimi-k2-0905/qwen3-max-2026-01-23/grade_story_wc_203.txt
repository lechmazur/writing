<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s quiet competence and ghost-seeing gift are embodied through tactile ladder placement, dust-reading, and silent stillness with Elias; the moment he pockets the photograph, his vocation fuses with private vow, earning a cost that seals the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dust pattern → crack → timed light-death → ghost offer → hidden cavity → vow to find Clara; the final “weightless burden” line crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration with unmistakable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dust-choked ticket office, green buzzing tube, and velvet-lined ceiling cavity are filtered through Leo’s technician gaze; the hidden crack literally guides ladder placement and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from idle curiosity to covenant with the dead; the synchronized light-failure acts as irreversible pivot that forces Leo’s promise, foreclosing passive observation with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond physical structures emerges through the twin barrels’ chime and sepia photograph; no moralizing—final nod to “lightest honors” reweights premise via image, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leo’s technician perception—dust as document, tool-belt heft, fluorescent buzz in teeth; no head-hop, rhythm breathes with ladder ascent and soft click of closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold, strong verbs (“splintered,” “coalescing,” “dissolving”) drive momentum; only micro-slip is “weightless burden” echo used twice but charged at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines elevator tech ghost-seeing with horologist circus relic—fresh synthesis; dust-reading as forensic ritual feels idiosyncratic to Leo, not trope recycling, though circus-abandonment is familiar ground.</comment>
