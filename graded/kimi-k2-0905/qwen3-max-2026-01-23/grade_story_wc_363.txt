<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning for a fifty-year-gone man is palpable and constant; every beat on the loom is micro-chosen from that wound, giving her interiority a single, credible spine. Yet the only on-page contradiction we see is wistful sorrow itself—no clashing hunger or anger complicates the shuttle, so the arc risks one-note. The final self-sacrifice is causally prepared: she empties her present life thread by thread to power the weave, so the cost is earned and visible. She fulfills the 9+ test, but barely: a second interior contradiction (terror of vanishing, say) would have lifted her into the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is announced early (weaving silence into a vessel) and honored in every lyrical increment until the closing tapestry. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard-image glows while Elara’s body fades into translucence—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the whole story. Orientation is clean (who/where within sixty words) and spatial continuity never wobbles. The slight reserve from 8+ owes to causal micro-slippage: the jigsaw puzzle method arrives late and is accepted without friction, so the final tightening feels orchestrated rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The “forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest” is evoked with scent of rain, graying blossoms, and moss under bare knees—details that evolve as the raveling worsens, so setting tracks the internal stakes. Micro-setting (the loom’s heartwood, amber bead warming a palm) directly constrains the climax: Elara must feed her body into the frame she sits at. Spatial choreography stays exact across loom, moss floor, and sapling coda. Gate for 9+ met: the loom/bead environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deliver a love-message across fifty lost years—never wavers and is tightened by the accelerating drain of color from the orchard. One visible cost-chain is unmistakable: each memory-thread subtracts pigment from present reality until she herself dematerializes; this is agency-through-renunciation under the accumulative lens. No false reversal or coincidence intrudes; pressure mounts by accretion rather than twist. Score stays sub-8.5 because the middle beats plateau: the orchard greys, but no secondary obstacle complicates her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as sacrifice = permanence: only by giving up her entire life-world can love be woven into durable art. The sapling’s “stoic sparkle” at the end is a conceptual re-pricing that reweights the orchard’s earlier greying into seed-capital for future growth—an image, not a maxim. Subtext lives in loom-bodily metaphors (shoulders “woven” with sorrow) that avoid explicit sermon. Echo-talk is avoided; one near-miss—“love woven with sacrifice takes root”—is cushioned inside an image, so penalty waived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice sustains a lyric-accumulative cadence—long breath-sentences that mimic thread piling on thread. Diction is horticultural and textile-specific (heartwood, shuttle, gnat-amber) and remains inside Elara’s rural lexicon. Compression is taught early (“weaving silence”) and repaid at closure when the hush becomes “healed, whole.” One head-hop attempt—sharing the forest’s communal breath—slides back to single POV; not enough to break the lens. The 9+ gate is missed only because syntax occasionally drifts into ornamental symmetry that momentarily stalls propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences are information-dense and do double labour (description + concept), e.g., “raveling silence…unraveling time’s tapestry.” Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet held together by loom logic. Filter verbs minimal; body-part attention (“palm warmed by bead”) keeps immediacy. A five-sentence run beginning “She wove…” beats a template cadence; this is pattern-taught repetition, not artifact, so penalty waived. Closure line “silence…resting, whole and deep” lands clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The loom-of-silence premise fuses textile craft with quantum memory-loss; the raveling silence concept makes the metaphor mechanically functional rather than decorative. Familiar trope (lost lover, last message) is inverted: success requires self-erasure, giving the orchard eternal life at the cost of its guardian. Specificity—tree-sap bead with gnat, jigsaw border logic—anchors abstraction in tactile oddity. Risk in lyric-accretional structure pays off: the final tapestry image is unimaginable without the slow additive pattern that birthed it.</comment>
