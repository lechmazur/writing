<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to restore friction while fearing the cost of her curse—drives every beat; the barefoot-palm moment crystallizes her need for tactile connection. Micro-choices (boot clicks, rock placement, tear track) embody motive without label-speak. The earned renunciation—accepting sequence-by-sequence sacrifice—lands with visible cost (aurora dimming, lighter pouch). Only the mentor’s dying line feels slightly convenient, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored friction circle reweights the world’s rules and her purpose under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: star-dust → spiral → hum → grit, each step tethered to prior image. The 120-word anchor is met: “tidal bluff… aurora… magnetic boots” situates who-where-when. Cost is legible in the dimmed aurora and lighter pouch; no late rule changes or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The tidal bluff, magnetic boots, and star-dust pouch function as micro-setting that directly constrain action: boots keep her anchored, pouch fuels the spiral. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—thermal sighs, liquid-mercury waves—never tourist catalog. The restored grit under her palm charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible drift of stones or body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore friction or remain in universal slide—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the curse shows failure. The spiral act is the single meaningful deepening that narrows options: draw aurora energy or accept endless drift. Cost is visible (dimming light, spent dust) and alters later tactics (she resets stones with reverence, not triumph). No coincidence resolves; the eels’ mirrored spiral merely acknowledges, not rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—harmony through invitation rather than domination—emerges from the eels’ voluntary spiral and the aurora’s patient teaching, never stated. The final image of wind resistance reweights the premise without moralizing. Sacred patterns remain mysterious, resisting tidy profundity. Only the mentor’s “harness the chaos” flirts with echo, but it’s brief and paid for by immediate embodied trial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: tidal equations, stellar cartography, logarithmic spiral. Syntax lengthens during ritual, then fractures into short clauses at the grit moment, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; aurora and eels are observed, not interiorized. Diction stays within her lexicon—“sacred patterns,” “cosmic resonance”—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for aurora, staccato for boot clicks, then quiet final line. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or texture. Metaphors stay coherent—liquid mercury, borrowed dawn—without mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: “whispered by her mentor Kael with his dying breath” could lose “with his dying breath,” but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frictionless physics rendered through tactile longing feels fresh; the eel-herder occupation is specific and irreplaceable. Collapsed star dust as both destroyer and catalyst offers a non-obvious synthesis. The logarithmic spiral bridging tidal math and aurora is an earned pattern, not quirky ornament. Risk-taking (lyric ritual, non-human acknowledgment) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
