<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s fiercely gentle precision, embodied grief, and micro-choices (orchid on skull, stone in bone-hand) render interior contradiction palpable; the final absorption of sorrow costs him bodily weight and forecloses return. No stock phrasing; every beat sharpens his penance. Earned renunciation lands with visible price: silver scars inside the emptied rib-hole. Voice stays singular, flaw intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure beats on-page: silver-veined tarot reformation + cold sorrow flooding Kael’s chest = Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost. Causal chain—card laid → memory recited → wisp invited in—tightens once and holds. One transition-free scene; orientation anchors by line 3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via repeated inlay motif and paid off when ash becomes scar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every step: roots dictate path, bones become witnesses, phosphorescent moss supplies the only light that permits the ritual. Selective sensory triage—damp moss, river stone’s chill, silver chill in veins—mirrors Kael’s narrowing attention. No decorative gothic tourism; each detail services the barter. Final image re-weights the glow from menace to benediction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trade his recklessness for her peace—signaled in graf 1 and escalates through each recalled kindness until the card ignites. Single micro-turn: wisp accepts offer, sorrow floods him; option to retreat vaporizes. Cost is irreversible bodily cold and permanent soul-patch. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated inlay acts: meaning is not found but sacrificially forged. Final silver-scarred Fool re-prices the premise—scars become strength, not shame. No articulation of thesis; image alone reweights the barter. Ambiguity lingers: peace purchased by self-wounding is still wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s bone-level perception; diction (“fiercely gentle,” “dusky resolve”) belongs to him, not author. Syntax lengthens then fragments under ritual intensity, ear-legible. No filter-verb stacks. Dialogue limited to one whispered name—correct restraint. Voice modulation tracks physiological cost without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or emotional news. Figurative density stays disciplined—one metaphor per beat, vehicles coherent (“roots became earth’s veins”). Strong verbs (“snaked,” “traced,” “flooded”) propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands clean; no scaffold. Micro-fragments under stress serve pulse, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Bartered-destiny trope inverted: he repays with self-scarring remorse rather than heroic rescue. Catacomb orchard feels fresh because bones are living ritual furniture, not scenery. Tarot not used for prophecy but as transferable wound. Synthesis of pagan-ritual + bone-cathedral + tarot feels inevitable, not stitched. Risk taken in quiet absorption beat pays off.</comment>
