<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s shift from dutiful archivist to desperate listener is embodied in the micro-choice to invert the stone’s use—from projection to receptivity—at the exact pressure-point of world-destroying noise. The interior contradiction between archival distance and visceral need is shown through bodily detail (“frantic heat…deep within the marrow”). Closure cost is legible: his identity is rewritten into “keeper of repose hammered true,” a lived stance rather than a label. Minor slip: the tear-release is a touch generic, trimming the otherwise flawless embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush expands, re-tuning the entire cave system and Kael’s role, with visible cost—the stone now “cool and still,” signalling spent agency. Causal chain (stone → fracture nexus → silence wave) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat intensifies sensory density until pattern-break (abrupt quiet) lands. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within 120 words. One hairline slip: lore fragment is summoned rather than foreshadowed, but it does not rupture the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The harmonic caves operate as both pressure-cooker and instrument: dissonant frequencies physically buckle stone and marrow, forcing Kael’s tactical pivot to the ice. Micro-setting—the spiral of hairline cracks—literally channels the decisive act; environment constrains how silence must be “found” rather than imposed. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sonic detail dominates, visual aura subordinate. Final image of concentric glowing circles etched into ice re-charges the ripple-mark motif, welding setting to closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is visceral from line 1; escalation occurs via density of sensory assault until the decisive inversion of the stone. One meaningful tightening: pulse-driven noise becomes marrow-deep pain, eliminating avoidance options and forcing descent to Glacial Heart. Cost is visible (stone spent, Kael exhausted, caves permanently re-tuned). Agency resides in the act of listening/acknowledging rather than force, coherent with Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if an earlier irretrievable loss were shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as silence not as absence but as active, compassionate re-ordering—shown when chaotic light softens to “contemplative amber.” Subtext operates in gesture: the echo chamber stone’s stillness at end silently states that receptivity wields more power than assertion. No moralizing; final line lets the caves’ “listening gratitude” resonate without commentary. One abstract phrase—“conceptual silence”—is outlier but swallowed by surrounding concrete sonic imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean focalization; diction stays within Kael’s cartographer-perceiver lexicon (“ripple-mark,” “sonic topography”). Rhythm modulates with crisis—compressed prepositional phrases during overload, then long calm sentences post-bloom. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Purposeful repetition of “gently luminous” teaches pattern early, cashed out in closure. Minor cadence echo in “stone… stone” sentences but reads as ritual emphasis rather than glitch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffolding. Metaphors are sonic-acoustic, maintaining coherent vehicle (“weaponized storm,” “hammered repose”). No mixed vehicles or synonym loops; only one paraphrase pair (“gently luminous” re-used) but it functions as motif glue. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating pressure and final release. Meets 9+ threshold technically, but one nominalization hiccup—“acoustic equilibrium”—keeps it just below hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mythic-acoustic world feels singular; mapkeeper who charts sound rather than land is fresh and inevitable here. Ritual of “reading” ice fractures to free embedded silence converts standard quest into phenomenological inversion. Energy beings remain unexplained, serving as catalytic force rather than trope overload. Risk in lyric repetition pays off when final concentric ripple-mark becomes new map, embedding innovation into closure. No evident derivative echo.</comment>
