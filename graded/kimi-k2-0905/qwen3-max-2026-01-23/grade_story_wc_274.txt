<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. conscience—are dramatized in one micro-choice under lethal pressure; the embodied “weight against her sternum” and split-second thumb-press show motive turned to irreversible action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: discovery → secret conduit → transmit → lie to Kael; closure lands as Decisive Change—data irrevocably gone, her identity as archivist shattered—cost is legible in the final “difficult dawn” image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice-shelved maps and dormant fiber lines are not scenery but tools that enable and constrain the final act; the “blue-tinged corridors” echo internal coldness and thaw, charging the transmitted packet with environmental irony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single stake—bury or release truth—tightens when boot-cracks intrude: transmit now or lose forever; agency is hers, price is instant complicity and lifelong secrecy, escalation crystallized in the soft chime.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: complicity vs. redemption enacted in one clandestine keystroke; no moralizing—final “difficult dawn” invites the city (and reader) to confront blood-built peace without prescribing answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains glacial precision—technical lexicon, ritual cadence, hushed consonants—mirroring archivist mindset; zero head-hop, psychic distance tightens to heartbeat during transmit beat, then exhales vapor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Varied sentence rhythm mirrors stealth and surge; no scaffold or synonym loops; figurative layer (“cathedral of frozen memory”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in cradle/tomb reversal—no clutter during climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “archivist vs. regime” arc is re-iced through cryogenic library, dormant fiber relic, and solstice isolation; the illicit upload via obsolete conduit feels inevitable yet fresh, turning conservation tech into revolution.</comment>
