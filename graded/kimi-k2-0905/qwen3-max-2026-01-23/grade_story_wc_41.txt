<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fleeting visions while knowing they’ll vanish—are dramatized in every chalk mark and driftwood placement; the final renunciation of remembering is earned through these tactile rituals, costing her the very vision she sought. Interiority is consistently concrete (“ghost on her skin,” “hollow shape of longing”). Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship pressure off the page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mist-chair’s creak reweights all prior markers, making the cost of her forgetfulness audible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk symbol layers density until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“junkyard prophet,” “fog sculpture garden”) and waiver-justified when the garden’s disorientation pays off in the resonant creak. No causal breaks; persistent constraint (memory loss) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fog garden, driftwood, and chalk function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: markers must be placed before the next vision dissolves, and the garden’s shifting mist literally governs what can be found. Sensory hierarchy is POV-particular—smell of rain, grease-stained palm—never touristic. Final image of the chalk-marked spine-shaped wood charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early and tightens through each marker placement; the audible creak is the undeniable payoff. Escalation is textural: each chalk symbol increases the density of loss until the single resonant note is reached. Cost is legible in the instant fade of the sound and the grandfather-memory she forfeits. Persistent constraint (precognitive forgetting) narrows options every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of erased particulars: memory is only provable through the artifacts we mark for ourselves. Subtext resides in the chalk ear/heart/key/remember—a private alphabet whose meaning dies with her. Final image of the dissolving chair reweights the premise: the sound of age is real yet unholdable. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “quiet purpose” she carries forward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic (“scent of rain on hot pavement” ghosting across skin), compressed lyric cadence that mirrors the flicker of visions. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains tight to Elara’s fragmenting attention. Rhythm swells and subsides with the tidal metaphor, paying off in the final hush. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, never intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening device; no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned—fog as camera, wood as spine—and pays off in the final mist-chair. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances pressure. One mixed moment—“tidal longing burned” is slightly stock, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-loss prophesy with sound archaeology in a fog garden—non-obvious synthesis. Driftwood-as-cartography and chalk sigils feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure is fully committed and pays off. Could edge higher if the grandfather tapes were rendered with one unique sensory detail rather than generalized “magnetic silence.”</comment>
