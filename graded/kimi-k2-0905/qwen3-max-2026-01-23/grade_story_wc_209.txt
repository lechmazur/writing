<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is painterly and specific; the grandmother ache is a believable spur. Yet the arc is almost entirely receptive—seeing the glass, feeling moved—without a moment where Elara’s agency alters the world or her art in a way that costs her something visible. The final brush-strokes are reported, not dramatized, so the “earned” change feels lightly sketched. A single micro-choice on the canvas, shown in real time with stakes, would have pushed this into the 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the dawn ray triggers the pattern break. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise—the glass reveals its hidden strata, reconfiguring Elara’s understanding and palette, cost felt in the tears she “traces” and the silence she now carries. The postcard clue is planted early and paid off in the exact eastern window fragment, keeping因果 coherent. Only a sliver below 9 because the external world offers no resistance after the glass delivers its gift; the tightening is purely perceptual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, honey glass, and the salvaged cathedral shard form a micro-setting that literally filters every ray of action; the etched vines and constellations charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is painterly—color, light, pigment dust—true to POV. Spatial choreography is clean: hand to glass, tear to cheek, crocus outside. Autumn glow in late winter risks a weather cliché, but the story justifies it as curated sanctuary, not seasonal carelessness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“will the glass yield its secret?”—is signaled early and tightens once, at the golden ray. Because the lens is Accumulative, the single intensification suffices: hidden petals emerge, reweighting her artistic covenant. No external opposition means pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is emotional, not strategic. Enough for this length, but a whisper away from the 8.2 floor needed for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: revelation demands patient darkness, whether moon-lit bloom or dawn-lit glass. Grandmother’s marginalia and the window’s hidden vines braid into one quiet credo—vulnerability trusts the gentlest light. Final image of indigo/pearl strokes reframes night flowers as “radiant hearts,” a non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest. No moralizing, only reconfiguration; ambiguity stays fertile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—pigment dust, postcard paper “fragile as dried petals,” the hush that tastes like grief. Syntax lengthens and softens under awe, shortens at the ray strike, mirroring painterly attention. No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythmic burden and succeeds. One clause drifts toward editorial uplift (“a covenant of trust with the compassionate dark”), but the texture recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “wool shawl whispering against stone” locates body, temperature, and hush in one stroke. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor extends the light/pigment lattice. One paraphrase loop (“quietly driven” twice in four lines) and a near-mixed metaphor (“umbral tenderness washed over”) keep it sub-9. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with the dawn, and no scaffolding obscures the reveal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—grandmother’s heirloom clue, artist seeking hidden truth in sacred glass—are transfigured by botanical specificity (moonflower, cereus) and the inversion that darkness is reception, not concealment. The salvaged cathedral shard embedded in a private pavilion is a fresh spatial move. Risk is lyric stillness over plot jeopardy; the gamble pays off here but keeps the score shy of the boldest tier.</comment>
