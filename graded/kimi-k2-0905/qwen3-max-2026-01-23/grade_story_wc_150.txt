<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the quiet ache of exile is repeatedly tether to tactile acts (trowel, moss, gnomon-carving). One flaw: the emotional crescendo is slightly over-articulated—“faith reborn not as blind certainty, but as conscious choice” tells us the calibration we already see in the tear and the hum against stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return (roots, shadow, blossom) thickens stakes until the noon alignment crystallizes the reconfiguration. Closure is present—the sundial’s living shadow visibly stitches exile to ancestry—cost legible in the tear and the vow to tend. Minor waver: orientation of orchard-to-tomb spatial relation could be anchored one beat sooner.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is evoked through porous senses—loam scent, blossom against bone—without catalogue. The sundial base functions as micro-setting that literally orients choice in the climax; removing it would collapse the causal image. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, knees brush soil, palm meets stone door in traceable sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore lost faith”—is signaled early and tightened once: the precise moment the new gnomon’s shadow touches the door reweights exile into custodianship. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial; sufficient for this length and lens. Cost is visible (tear, vow, surrender to continuum) but not materially punitive; still meets band guardrail for 8.8- entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of continuity versus rupture emerges through recurrent root-and-shadow imagery; no moral is preached. The final image of a living shadow on worn stone reconfigures the premise without abstract statement, achieving Conceptual Repricing. The insight feels earned because it is anchored in the protagonist’s bodily labor and sensory surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—selective attention to constellations in stone, apple-blossom lullabies. Syntax breathes with pacing: elongated cadence in wandering passages, clipped purposeful clauses during gnomon-setting. No head-hop; diction stays within her exilic, music-remembering lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Figurative layering (“roots cradling bones like tender guardians”) is purposeful and paid off when roots become reunion metaphor at close. One minor loop: “interrupted journeys” is repeated in variant phrasings three times—trim one to sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing diaspora return with orchard catacomb and functional sundial feels specific and non-obvious; the living root/bone weave freshens standard “return-to-roots” trope. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is justified by coherent closure image. Could edge higher with sharper friction against potential desecration taboo, but current complexity satisfies.</comment>
