<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“texture of transformation”), but the only micro-choice on stage—uncorking jars—feels pre-decided; no live contradictory impulse pressures her in the release beat, so the renunciation is beautiful yet already resolved, limiting felt cost to texture rather than stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the volcano’s hush and her emptied hands reweight prior light/memory motifs with undeniable conceptual cost; causal chain is thin (release → legend fulfilled) but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break of glowing ascent against black sand crystallizes the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Black sand, warm obsidian grit, and jar glass constrain every tactile beat; the beach’s thermal pulse against bare feet steers the kneel-and-release choreography and charges the final hush, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—comprehending transformation through relinquishment—tightens once: from clutching twenty-four jars to open-palmed sky. The tightening is textural (river of living light vs. dark) rather than causal, sufficient under Accumulative lens, but no secondary obstacle complicates or raises price beyond sentimental loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: benevolent accident as geologic grace. Subtext hums in the fisherman’s unspoken prophecy and the synchronized mountain hush, letting the reader reprice miracle vs. intention without moralizing; only the abstract phrase “texture of transformation” flirts with thesis-statement, barely capped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic, lava-slow cadence that matches volcanic breath; diction stays within Elara’s sensorium (“granular shore,” “green-gold spark”). No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent, though syntax edges toward uniform clause-stacking that softens under peak release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences are plush but information-dense; occasional modifier strings (“silent waltz choreographed across millennia”) verge on purple yet serve cadence. No loops, clean pronouns, strong verbs; one paraphrase echo (“whispering hush” / “vibrant hush”) is intentional motif-reprise, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines destitute philanthropist, bottled bioluminescence, and accidental prophecy into a fresh geologic-fable; the living-stars-appease-volcano image feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk in lyric stillness pays off; only the coin-toss coincidence (legend fulfilled) is familiar DNA, offset by sensory specificity.</comment>
