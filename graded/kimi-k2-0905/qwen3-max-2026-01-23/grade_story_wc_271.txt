<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—muscles locking at gull-cry, hand steadying on bark—yet the “pearl of stillness” is named more than enacted, so contradictory impulses stay summary. The photograph beat shows hierarchy of values, but no micro-choice alters present risk; endurance costs are felt yet already paid before scene start. Earned, but therapy-adjacent phrasing (“somatic markers,” “integration”) slightly softens peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens taught early via returning freeze→grounding pattern; closure is Charged Poise—photograph tucked away, inner light redefined—cost legible as permanent vigilance assumed. Orientation anchored by gravel crunch and cliff smell within 50 words. One paraphrase loop (“realism… realism”) mild, does not blunt final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cypress bark, salt breeze, sun-warmed bench act as micro-setting that physically grounds each freeze-recovery cycle; cliff-edge arboretum constrains her path and supplies tactile anchors required for somatic method. Lighthouse reframe at end recharges earlier image without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy reflects PTSD narrowing then widening—precise, lived-in, never catalogue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Dominant stake is immediate: remain present versus dissociate. Each freeze tightens the pattern; photograph beat deepens cost but does not narrow external options—pressure is affective, not tactical. No new reversal after midpoint; escalation is cumulative intensity rather than further constriction. Sufficient for lyric short form, yet peak cost is emotional memory, not forfeited future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—broken ground nurturing defiant beauty—emerges through orchid roots, sea thrift, lighthouse husk, never named aloud. Final image of vacant keeper-less tower reweighted as internal beacon offers resonant CR. Subtext in gesture: smoothing photograph = tending fragile root. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “not restored, but remade.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature botanically exact (“precise veins of a leaf”). Rhythm modulates—short clauses under freeze, lengthening on recovery. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs minimal and motive-driven. Freezing-cry linkage taught early, pays off in final breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><answer>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; each sentence advances image or grounding step. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One register drift: “conceptual integration” slides toward clinical; minor, outside peak beat. Final line earns smile without sentimentality. Clean mechanics, vivid nouns/verbs, strong paragraph cut test.</answer>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of drone-survivor PTSD with botanical arboretum walk feels non-obvious; lighthouse-keeper self-anointing fresh. Somatic-marker grounding method rendered as lived ritual rather than self-help note. Orchid metaphor risks familiarity but saved by coastal specificity. Risk level moderate; transformative angle present but not startling.</comment>
