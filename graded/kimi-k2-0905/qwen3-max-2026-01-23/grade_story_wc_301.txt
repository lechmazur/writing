<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical surveyor vs. raw, un-medicated feeling—stay active in every beat; the taped accordion and the folded-map sacrifice visibly externalize her self-forgiveness arc with cost. Interiority is concrete (“ivy whispered against her sleeves” equals paternal guilt). The final micro-choice to leave the map in the tile crack crystallizes renunciation with felt price. One hairline slip: “tear of release” edges toward label-speak, but embodied motion follows instantly, blunting the cliché.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust motes, jasmine, graffiti couplets) increments the stake until the single middle-C note reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks toward the river with accordion weight as undeniable cost—no causal twist needed, but options are reconfigured. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Non-closure accumulation: none; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>The station’s ivy-choked textures constrain movement—gate snag, splintered restroom door forcing her inside—so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting dominance (accordion bellows, cracked porcelain) fulfills the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Selective sensory economy (wild jasmine vs. damp wood) mirrors internal erosion without catalogue. Slight over-reliance on visual; a sniff of mildewed leather could have widened the hierarchy, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled in paragraph 2 and tightened when graffiti lines force confrontation; the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. No secondary reversal, but the patched accordion becomes the visible price, foreclosing the “perfect restoration” path. Cost is legible: surrendering the annotated map = tangible forfeiture. Could use one earlier micro-loss (cut finger on gate?) to push into 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>River-as-erosion theme emerges organically from graffiti, map, and accordion tape; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of “current of peace finally flowing” offers non-literal repricing without moralizing. Insight earned through mended-bellows music, not platitude. Ambiguity remains—she hasn’t “healed,” only chosen flow—preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a perceptual signature attuned to hydrology metaphors (“emotional sediment,” “gradients of absence”). Diction stays within Elara’s professional lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for surveyor calm, staccato fragments during graffiti discovery. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. One hairline filter verb (“she felt the jagged truth”) but immediately dramatized by the played note, keeping 9+ gate open.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences multitask (“dust motes swirled... carrying scent”). No loops, no mixed metaphor; “razor-sharp world edges” recurs with purpose. Final line cadence echoes opening “razor-sharp” now softened to “current of peace,” rewarding pattern. Minor scaffolding: “with a slow, deliberate breath—a daringly methodical inhale” compresses twice; trimming one clause would nudge higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: medicated withdrawal + river-survey methodology + bathroom oracle convertsrailway ruin into interior watershed. Risky non-linear structure (static pilgrimage) pays off via accumulative imagery. Patched accordion as sonic closure device is memorable and specific. Graffiti wisdom edge close to fortune-cookie but saved by concrete map sacrifice that follows.</comment>
