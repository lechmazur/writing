<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s vow is stated early and every tactile-aural translation beat performs it, yet her interior contradiction (fear of the curse vs. conviction) is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment that risks failure. The final renunciation—placing the cleared diamond—reads as completion, not cost, so the earned-stasis beat feels lightly charged rather than irreversible. Still, the copper-veined motif threads body, tool, and action into a singular perceptual signature, keeping her above the functional tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the echo-tunnel rule and holds to the last cadence; each bird-pattern → texture → sound layer thickens density until the final chorus reweights the stake from “save language” to “language reborn.” Closure is on-page: the diamond flares, the bone towers become instruments, and the canyon breathes the word back—an undeniable CR with conceptual cost (Elara’s life-purpose fulfilled, path foreclosed). No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored within 120 words and spatial choreography remains clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Environment (canyon, tunnel, bone spires) is not backdrop but acoustic tooling that constrains every tactical choice; the tunnel’s echo-law literally enables the translation spell. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—copper filaments, fossil chill, obsidian wings—never tourist-catalog. Micro-setting (diamond topography) doubles as the keyboard she plays, charging the final image. One nit: “endless echoes” is twice told, not shown, a micro-loop that keeps it below the 9-line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the death of the Old Tongue—is signaled in line 3 and tightened by each aerial mimic until the spiral convergence forces the culminating utterance. Escalation is textural: each new bird glyph → new phoneme → echo layer compresses possibility until only the final word remains. Cost is legible—the diamond’s warmth and the towers’ marrow-vibration show energy extracted from her body/voice—but the price could be sharper (no exhaustion, tremor, or blood in the copper veins). Still, agency is continuous and luckless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—translation as transmutation of silence into communal memory—emerges solely through the acoustic alchemy sequence; no explanatory sermon needed. The closing image of the canyon breathing the word skyward offers a non-literal answer: language survives by becoming landscape, not by residing in any single speaker. One soft beat: “the language was reborn” borders explicit thesis, but the next sentence recovers with the towers-as-instruments reconfiguration. Complexity holds; no false equivalence between silence and sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that remains interior to Elara’s tactile-sonic lens; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors process—short percussive clauses for clicks, elongated vowel-phrases for hums—creating prose-as-instrument without self-indulgence. Register stable: no academic drift, no filter-verb clutter. The quiet, articulate trait is rendered through controlled diction and breath-length pacing rather than declared. Minor echo: “echoed” used twice in adjacent sentences; otherwise rhythm is clean under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (bone towers as cathedrals, diamond as captured constellation) and physically consistent. No paraphrase loops; each bird-pattern description introduces new acoustic information. A single mixed trope—“humming with latent potential” (sound/touch overlap)—is forgiven because the pattern quickly resolves into literal sonic action. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with the flock’s choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of ornithomancy + echotectural linguistics feels specific, not cribbed; no prior template maps texture-to-sound via live bird choreography inside fossilized spine-towers. Risk—the entire plot banks on synchronized flight matching internal flaws—pays off because the text teaches the pattern early and fulfills it in a final spiral that reweights the diamond into a captured constellation. Transformation is complete: remove any one piece (copper veins, echo tunnel, bird script) and the mechanism collapses. Fresh inflection lingers after page.</comment>
