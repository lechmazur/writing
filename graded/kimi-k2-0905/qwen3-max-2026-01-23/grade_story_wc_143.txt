<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-anchored resolve is concrete—spilling the sand, the tear, the final look—yet the interiority flirts with sentimental summary (“profound silence,” “quiet dignity”) that blunts contradictory impulse. The micro-choice of sealing the grain back over the heart crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test even if the beat leading up to it leans on abstract rather than bodily tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The single-scene arc lands a clean Charged Poise: sunrise triggers the chemical shutter, the crater’s fate is sealed, Kael’s vigil forecloses to a last descent—cost is legible in the final line “carrying the last light.” Orientation is anchored by word 80; causal chain (capsule → sun → current → photo) holds; no amnesia or teleporting props. Closure reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Meteor Crater’s rim, the wooden hourglass memory, and the chemical rig all filter through Kael’s professional eye; cold gravel, thermal gloves, and camera hiss constrain action and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—moonset east, sun west, descent path fixed. One missing gate: the nickel-iron ore is asserted not shown, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the untouched dawn—tightens once when the first gold sliver dissolves the capsule barrier, making the photo irreversible. Escalation is situational pressure: silence, cold, grief, and corporate deadline compress into the one-second exposure. Visible price is the elegiac ache Kael carries downslope; no reversal, but a meaningful narrowing of options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through the sand grain, grandfather’s hourglass, and the chemical timer—no moralizing, only the final image of “last light” repricing progress. The crater’s billion-year rock layers versus one-day mining license create non-literal resonance. Missing a counter-reading that complicates Kael’s complicity as USGS employee; still, ambiguity lingers without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature is geologist-poetic—“sharp crescent,” “bowl-shaped scar,” “billion-year-old rock layers.” Rhythm swells toward the shutter click, then thins for descent, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact; slight register lift toward the lyrical is earned by the elegiac mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold; high density (“sealed the sand grain back into its pouch, tucking it securely over his heart”). One mixed metaphor cluster (“impossible gold fractured the horizon”) is permissible at climax. Technical photochemical description is accurate, concise, and propulsive. Final third is clean; 9+ gate opens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The chemical-timer camera as analog elegy feels fresh; merging grandfather’s hourglass with photochemical countdown synthesizes time motifs without gimmickry. Specificity of Meteor Crater and 1940s caretaker legacy grounds the premise beyond generic eco-elegy. Risk could push further—no complicity critique of Kael’s own survey employer—but the synthesis still reweights familiar loss into memorable inflection.</comment>
