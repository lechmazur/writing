<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is poetically specific (“gripped reality loosely” felt as damp chill), but her sole agency is witnessing; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice heightens cost. The ending renunciation is gentle and thematically apt, yet forecloses no path we saw her tempted by. Interior texture is rich, but motivation stays static; no visible flaw complicates her ritual. Earned stasis lands, but without an earlier fork, the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descent–return pattern deepens silence until “crumbling peace” reweights the stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sapling’s hope reframes decay as evolution with conceptual cost—“permanence” is the thing lost. Orientation is swift; origami swan teaches the burrow rule by line 90. No因果 reversals are required; the final line crystallizes options under the regenerative rule-set.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library, refuge, river, and swan are handled as tactile tools; the obsidian wall’s spreading crack directly mirrors Elara’s loosening grip, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and hush, matching her witness-stance. Spatial choreography is clean: fold-unfold-fold tracks without drift. Environment constrains no tactical choice but reweights meaning at exit, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is declared early; pressure tightens only texturally via encroaching decay and the river’s new channel. No live option is foreclosed; her return is inevitable. Silence deepens, but agency remains observational, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for accumulative escalation, yet lacks a beat where judgment would actually tempt her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-peace emerges through concrete cycles: paper fold/return, crack/light, decay/sprout. Final inscription is overt but earned by prior images; it reweights decay from loss to dialogue. Ambiguity persists: is witness enough? Subtext rests in the swan’s worn creases and the widening crack—silent arguments against permanence. No moral is forced; resonance lingers in phosphorescent water and trembling leaf.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax elongating then compressing with breath of descent. Diction stays within a keeper’s lexicon—“cryptic folds,” “emerald thread”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is hush-weighted: every noticed thing is texture or hush, reinforcing motif. Rhythm modulates from cathedral cadence to single-line pulse, echoing the regenerative silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence variety is deliberate; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are interwoven (“moss stitch broken flagstones”) yet stay physically coherent. One mixed moment—“planet’s slow, rhythmic pulse” beside “silent symphony”—is minor. Density is high; each line advances image or rule, propelling the quiet descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mythic library-tender is familiar, yet the origami swan as earth-key and regenerative silence as heal-antidote feel freshly synthesized. Risk is quiet: no villain, no death, only patience—yet piece commits fully, avoiding sentimental decay-porn. Final sapling in dome reprises seeded image without feeling planted for points. Specificity of fungal blue on atlas lifts the trope into memory.</comment>
