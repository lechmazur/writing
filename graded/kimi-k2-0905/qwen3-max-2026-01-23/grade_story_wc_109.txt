<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—obsession with silence yet yearning to give it form—drives every micro-choice; the obsidian stylus tremble and flake-catching digit embody embodied emotion. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; her sole-on-stage endurance is credible. Reflection stays under 20 % and is tethered to present cues (shattered gold becomes ink). The final renunciation—closing the booklet at dawn—carries visible cost: the star fades, her vigil ends, the path of endless charting foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence-images intensifies until the lone-star fade reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the small circle stroke crystallizes storm-calm cycle, cost felt in the pale star and sealed night. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“storm-tossed ridge fort”). No causality break; booklet flakes and stylus shards track consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is weaponized: the granite rampart’s residual drip and wolf-cry supply discrete sounds that Elara must negate into ink; the shattered watchtower window later becomes a mapped void. Fort geography stays coherent; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (gold flakes, obsidian stylus) constrains each inscription choice. Final image—sun gilding the same ridge—recharges initial storm palette, closing the loop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the night’s silence before the last star vanishes—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens as stellar extinction approaches; each flake lost = live option erased. No antagonist needed; the clock alone escalates. Cost is legible: the star’s pale-out coincides with the map’s completion, sealing her vigil’s end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via iterative silence-images rather than statement: silence as palpable, fossilized medium. Subtext lives in stylus-touch and flake-voids—what is removed is the map. Final image reweights premise: darkness is not enemy but archive. No moralizing sentence appears; meaning is felt in the small circle’s eternal cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is salt-bleached, pebble-tumbled: “tumbl/ing,” “flake-crystalline,” “marbled hush” recur with rhythmic control. Syntax lengthens during mapping beats, shortens at star-fade. No dialogue, so those bullets waived. Free-indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulates from storm-breath to dawn-sigh without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Ear-test passes: cadence swells then hushes, mirroring content. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor pays off (flakes = fallen stars, silence = amber resin). No mixed metaphors. Scaffolding minimal: bracketed counts are generation artifacts and ignored. Sentence variety strong; no template cadence. Peak beats (final stroke) are crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartography of silence—is fresh; inverse of star-mapping tales. Trope of oracle-as-mapper is inverted: she maps absence, not fate. Specific coastal origin (pebble shore) grounds voice. Risk: lyric density could obscure, but closure stays legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
