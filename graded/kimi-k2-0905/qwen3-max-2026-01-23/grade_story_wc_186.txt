<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her retrocognitive flashes are embodied in “hurried footsteps” and “whispered calculations,” not labels. The shard pressed to her forehead forces a micro-choice that crystallizes her value hierarchy (prove meaning vs. surrender to skepticism). Cost is legible: thirty years of charcoal tracks on hide and the momentary erasure of every comforting hum. The closing smile is earned; no safety-hedging, but the arc stops just short of showing how this victory complicates her life going forward, keeping it from exceptional band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the same shard that imposed silence now refracts silence into communal light, making the “coincidence = intention” premise undeniable. Causal lens holds: because she angled the largest fragment (and paid with lifelong isolation), therefore the valley answers with lanterns. Cost is on the page—“tears traced clean paths”—and the constraint (only one alignment every × years) persists. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. Minor slip: the phrase “thistle-blown hope” is used twice yet never re-seeds literal thistles; still, the image reweights at the lantern constellation, so the effect lands.</comment>

<comment>The glass pavilion is not backdrop; its hum modulates from breath to joyous chord, tracking the stake’s resolution. Constellation-etched walls and obsidian dais constrain her choreography—she must climb, angle, nestle. The shard itself functions as micro-setting: its fracture dictates where the two star-beams must kiss. Final image externalizes the pavilion’s song into valley lanterns, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove alignments are intentional”—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpened by external mockery. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged astrolabe, each dismissed scoff, thickens the cost layer until the conjunction narrows options to one brittle prism angle. The tightening is single but meaningful; failure would confirm nihilism. Price is visceral—thirty years plus the momentary total sensory void—so the alignment’s success feels purchased, not gifted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of silence: what muffles the world also lets meaning be heard. The shard’s trajectory—fracture → silence → refraction—reweights “coincidence” into “covenant” without sermonizing. Subtext in the lantern reply is pure image; no character utters a thesis. The thistle metaphor survives its double mention because it physically roots in “courtyard cracks,” anchoring abstraction to grit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric hovers at intimate distance, filtering every cosmic noun through Elara’s perceptual grammar: Vega “kisses” Deneb, star-paths are “a language of love.” Syntax swells into long breath units during the hum, then fractures into clipped beats—“A beam… A beam…”—mirroring the prism’s split. No head-hop; no poetic inflation beyond the POV’s lexicon. Filter-verb count is near zero; immediacy holds even in vision flash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either advances star-tracking mechanics or tightens emotional cost. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light is “cool silver” vs “warm gold,” never mixed. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo: “humming silence” becomes “humming silence” now reconfigured. The single “thistle-blown” repetition is intentional motif, not artifact. Rhythm accelerates into the three heart-beat clause, then releases, supporting the climactic pulse without drawing attention to its own virtuosity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-relighting is familiar, but the inversion of silence-as-lens feels fresh. The “shard of hush” transforms a standard crystal quest into epistemic tool: proof that pattern equals love letter. Star-alignment mechanics are grounded in brass astrolabes and cured hide, not techno-mystic handwavium. Risk lies in the lyric double of “thistle-blown hope,” yet the gamble pays off when literal lights sprout across valley soil, making the metaphor biological fact.</comment>
