<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s slow-hand faith versus industrial spellcraft is viscerally embodied—ink under fingernails, frost on tears—yet her final refusal to “take” the keystone is prefigured only by thematic statement, not an earlier dramatized flaw of possessiveness; the renunciation still lands because the causality of “witness, not harvest” is threaded through every beat of sensory memory she feeds the stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the keystone left glowing, jasmine drifting down-mountain, city shells exposed as hollow—an earned stasis that costs her guild standing and future expeditions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard (mist, mercury, snow, moonflower) tightens the stake of “sacred slowness” without a causal twist, yet the final reweighting of automation-as-empty is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-settings—the window-box, the ivy-carved arch, the moonflower petal—function as pressure vessels: the sandstone rose’s alien warmth literally melts her shame, and the returned frost-jasmine scent re-enters her room at the end, constraining her next act to planting. Brilliant dimness is not just mood but navigable terrain that forces the choice to descend empty-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“witness magic untouched by calculation”—tightens through pattern intensification: each impossibility (upward mercury, suspended snow) deepens the cost of extraction until refusal becomes the only non-hollowing option. The single meaningful turn is her kneeling release of memories; it narrows future paths without a second reversal, sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through sensory particulars: automation’s hollowness is not declared but shown in sterile fireworks that instruments cannot register jasmine-light. The closing image of moonflower glow invisible to guild sensors performs a Conceptual Repricing—revalorizing “underachievement” as the sole remaining magic—without a sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—syntax slows with deliberate horticultural cadence, then fractures into vapor-short clauses at altitude. No head-hop; compression (“she unstrapped her shame”) is taught by the third paragraph and paid off when the same syntax is applied to frost, not emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or filter stacks; figurative language is sparse, pattern-deliberate (“brilliant dimness,” “sterile fireworks”) and never muddies causality. Information density is high—every sentence advances atmosphere, memory, or mythos—yet rhythm breathes, mirroring ascent/descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “garden folly keystone” trope is inverted: the object’s power is to remain, not to be claimed. Sustained-care magic is familiar, but rendering it as a measurable scent-return and instrument-invisible light gives concrete specificity. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
