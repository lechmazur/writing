<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“brittle crack of a surrendered grudge” embodies emotion without labels. Motivation stays anchored to the concrete goal of pattern-finding; every sand grain placed is a micro-choice that externalizes inner need. The final “Integrate” is earned because the mandala’s construction dramatizes the ache it answers. Cost is visible: the mandala dissolves, peace is fleeting, yet she pockets the flake—an acceptance of impermanence baked into gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the anxious “What remains?” thread is woven into the hush by her spoken word, changing the grotto’s acoustic and her stance. Cost is legible in the cooling flake and the blurring sand—artifacts of effort lost to mist. Causal chain is interior but intact: tile whisper → mandala → integration → transformed silence. Orientation is complete by word 30; no lens contradiction at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moss-covered parabolic grotto is more than backdrop; its whispers supply raw material that the mandala physically reorganizes. Lilac mist drinks stone and dyes the sand, so environment dictates palette and symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: chalk wall → sand floor → pocket flake → exit threshold. Final image of dissolving lines ties setting to theme of impermanence, charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find pattern in her unraveling”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the new anxious whisper threatens the hush; her counter-word forecloses retreat into mere release. Cost is the mandala’s erasure and the admission that chaos persists. Agency is cognitive yet causal under Accumulative lens: internal decision reshapes external acoustic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of alchemic integration emerges through tactile images rather than thesis: lilac sorrow transmutes into pearl hope via sand geometry. Subtext lives in silences—the hush absorbs rather than erases, implying trauma stewardship. Final line’s “beauty of the mess” is an earned conceptual repricing, not sermon. Ambiguity remains: peace is portable yet fragile, resisting moral tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains lilac-tinted perceptual signature throughout—mist, petal dust, ceramic gleam filter every observation. Rhythm modulates: long sensuous clauses build mandala, then single-word imperative cuts to silence. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded to Elara. Compression (“plink”, “Integrate”) is taught by context and paid off in hush deepening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences pull double duty—description advances emotional mapping: “concentric circles mapped the cyclical nature of grief she sensed.” No filler loops; each clause adds pattern or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within sand/light/acoustic field. A single soft cliché—“like iron filings to a gentle magnet”—is offset by original cluster of “whispering gallery tile flake,” keeping overall freshness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concept of sculpting chaos into sacred geometry via ephemeral sand inside a sentient grotto feels non-obvious and inseparable from this character. Badger chalk sketch risks whimsy but frames creative defiance, later sublimated into mandala. Risk taken with auditory alchemy pays off: silence as presence. While “artist heals through art” is familiar, the acoustic mandala and lilac mist give it new sensory skin.</comment>
