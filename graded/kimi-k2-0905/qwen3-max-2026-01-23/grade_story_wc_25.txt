<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—rescue Vale yet prove quiet mastery—drives every micro-choice; the coin/key tactile rituals embody cost. Walk-identification trait enables the locating beat and later humbles Vale, so competence is earned, not gifted. Final refold of the map shows renunciation of louder validation; the cost is Vale’s prior contempt now mirrored in his silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael values whispers, therefore he bypasses Vale’s shouts, therefore guides him via acoustic seam, therefore proves principle. Orientation locked by word 60; no teleporting props—key’s reveal is prepared by earlier pocket touch. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael foregoes verbal victory, folds map, and the labyrinth’s unchanged silence is the felt cost that reweights the night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rust-streaked containers, charged storm air, and acoustic seams are filtered through Kael’s technician gaze; every sensory note either guides navigation or mirrors theme. The invisible whispering-gallery seam is revealed by keyed action, so environment actively rescues rather than decorates. Spatial choreography is immaculate: footfalls, corridor angles, and sound paths track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validate quiet method—tightens when Vale’s shouting failure makes the labyrinth appear hostile; Kael’s whispered counter-move narrows options to “soft or fail.” Storm amplification is coincidence that complicates, not saves; the acoustic trick succeeds only because Kael earlier mapped the fold. Cost is legible: Vale’s awestruck silence confirms Kael’s ethos yet forecloses future collaboration, a social price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—subtlety outperforms force—emerges from acoustic physics and Kael’s refusal to gloat; no character sermonizes the moral. The brass key and zodiac coin reweight from mystery to mandate of flow, letting silence speak. Final image of recalibrated labyrinth offers resonant, non-literal confirmation that quiet systems endure after storms pass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s technician idiom: “sound currents,” “wind eddies,” “acoustic triangle”—perceptual signature is sharp. Syntax lengthens during listening beats, then compresses at the click of the key, mirroring tension release. No head-hop; Vale’s interior is legible only through gait and hoarse voice, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or filler. Figurative language is spare—“violent ribbons,” “thread of sound”—and always sensory, not ornamental. Only minor scaffold: “He waited, trusting…” could compress further, but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Acoustic rescue via forgotten whispering-gallery inside shipping containers feels fresh; trait of gait-recognition is specific and plot-essential. Storm-as-amplifier repurposes natural spectacle as tactical tool without deus-ex convenience. Conceptual repricing of key-without-lock supplies a quiet epiphany that retroactively charges earlier mystery.</comment>
