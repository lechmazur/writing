<comment>Kael’s creed-driven refusal to doctor the echo is dramatized in body-level micro-choices (the boot-to-parapet dance, the eye-softening), and the tear-on-dust moment embodies cost without label-speak. Interior contradiction is vivid: reverence vs. physical exhaustion, honesty vs. the temptation to “capture” the echo. The renunciation of direct focus is earned through prior causal setup and forecloses future ease; it’s an earned stasis that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensorial layer (sandstone hum, gear-pulse, silver bloom) deepens the dominant stake instead of merely decorating. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—wisdom is not seized but allowed to settle, and the price is the perpetual vigilance Kael accepts by walking away. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“sandstone arches”), and the kinetic parapet’s rules are taught early enough to support the final indirect consecration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The pavilion, parapet, and conjured clearing act as micro-settings that physically constrain tactics: no direct gaze, weight-shift only, boundary must be honored. Selective sensory hierarchy (cool porcelain, subterranean heartbeat, shimmer at the circle’s rim) mirrors Kael’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is airtight—body, mask, sand, gear lattice track cleanly through the beats. The final image of wind flowing around an undisturbed circle recharges the motif of peripheral sanctity.</comment>

<comment>Stake—“preserve the echo before silence claims it”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens via the irreversible dimming of each vibration. Escalation is textural: resonance fades like cooling embers, forcing Kael to risk permanent loss if he falters. The single decisive turn is the shift from trying to “capture” to consecrating via indirect awareness; this narrows his option set and visibly costs stamina (“joints aching”). No coincidence resolves the tension; the clearing’s emergence is earned by synchronized bodily alignment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through dramatized particulars: truth as restraint, wisdom as sanctuary rather than possession. The prophet’s quoted line is the only overt statement, yet it lands as crystallized payoff, not preachiness. Subtext resides in gesture—Kael’s kneel, the wind’s circumvention of the circle—inviting reflection on listening versus owning. The final image reweights the premise: preservation is release, a conceptual repricing felt in the hush that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Kael’s perceptual signature: synesthetic attention to hum, breath, and weight. Syntax lengthens during peripheral softening, then contracts as the circle forms, mirroring neurologic shift. No head-hopping; prophet’s words are external sound only. Diction stays within a desert-ascetic register—no corporate register drift—and rhythmic control heightens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual respiration. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“embers cooling in twilight,” “subterranean heartbeat”) and never clutters the high-pressure consecration beat. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. A single mixed echo—“sand lay undisturbed and air shimmered”—is justified as the conjured clearing’s dual nature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of brass-geared desert mysticism with a meditation on indirect will feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric escalation (no antagonist, no dialogue) is fully committed to and pays off in the charged poise ending. Removing the kinetic parapet or peripheral method would collapse the entire causal/textural engine, proving specificity. The piece avoids familiar fantasy templates; its machinery is sui generis while remaining emotionally legible.</comment>
