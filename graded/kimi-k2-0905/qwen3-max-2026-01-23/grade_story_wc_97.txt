<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in micro-choices—threading the reel, clutching the clock—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into abstractions (“steely longing” twice). The final laugh and the 3:18 reset are earned, but the arbor transit feels frictionless; a stronger flaw-driven stumble would sharpen cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the minute’s restoration reweights time’s rule-set with undeniable cost. Causal chain (film cipher → sonic key → arbor → clock shift) holds; only the arbor’s准入 logic is asserted, not tested, keeping it just sub-9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Terminal glass and abalone-bark arbor are filtered through Elara’s musician’s eye; the broken clock constrains her grip and is charged in the final image. Spatial clarity never wavers; a second sensory channel beyond sight in the arbor would push higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loosen grief’s chokehold—tightens when compasses override geography. One meaningful turn: the needle locks on her heart, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the irretrievable minute she gives up to gain the 3:18; visible but could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Love’s persistence beyond chronology emerges through the clock’s repricing, never stated. The arbor’s heart-maps externalize grief without allegorical flattening. Final image of restored minute invites quiet counter-reading: fate can be nicked, not defeated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s musician perception; diction (“silver heirloom frozen at 3:17”) is precise, rhythm modulates with scene pulses. No head-hop; filter verbs (“she felt”) appear only during transit, justified by disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong density—“afternoon light bled through vaulted glass” does triple duty. Occasional modifier stacks (“luminous cyclone, coalescing into Leo’s gentle smile”) slightly overwrought in closure beat; one mixed liquid/light metaphor keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embeds classic after-life rendezvous inside a film-cipher / heart-compass system that feels bespoke; minute-hand repricing is a fresh temporalcost. Could risk more by letting the cipher fail once before succeeding.</comment>
