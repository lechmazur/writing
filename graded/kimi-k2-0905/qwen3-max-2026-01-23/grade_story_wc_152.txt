<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s placid-mad façade creates crisp interior contradiction that powers every beat; the embroidery-needle micro-choices show hierarchy of values under rising risk. The final quiet delivery costs her visibility yet saves the realm—Earned Stasis with felt price. Motivation (“listen for unheard stories”) drives discovery and final tactic; no competence overreach. Only minor gap: coup consequence for her remains off-stage, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: Vega misplacement → thread divination → corrected chart → covert delivery, each because/therefore link tightens options. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost—fleet rerouted, Elara erased. All anchors locked by word 28; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: her anonymity must hold or she dies—shapes every post-discovery move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Eternal candle functions as micro-setting: heat-navigates possibility space, final flicker silhouettes conspirators’ sigil—directly charges closure. Cobalt halls, autumn mist, and ridge geography are filtered through Elara’s stealth priorities; spatial choreography clean. Sensory economy favors touch and sight tied to embroidery action. Environment constrains choice twice: candle use for divination, mist for undetected exit—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent fleet massacre—signaled by word 103 and escalates through chart falsification reveal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she alone re-stitches safe passage, narrows coup window. Cost legible: anonymity forfeited to Captain Idris, perpetual exile implied. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden truth versus institutional arrogance emerges through embroidery vs. brass instruments, not statement. Final image—flame dipping in farewell—reweights earlier “eternal” descriptor, implying even timeless tools acknowledge mortal choice. Subtext in thread-whispers and vacant smile sustains ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing caps the piece; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: “threads of starlight silver,” “golden anchor,” diction consistent with artisan-mystic POV. Syntax lengthens during contemplative embroidery, compresses during candle divination—rhythmic pressure control. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext. No head-hop or register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths echo embroidery glide vs. candle flicker urgency. High density: “falsified charts designed to steer the royal fleet into the Serpent’s Maw” packs world, stakes, danger into one clause. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Only hairline slip: “embers” twice for leaves—minor repetition, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Star-chart embroiderer as royal-saboteur detector feels fresh; combines craft femininity with astrophysics authority. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic spy—embroidery mechanics are causally integral. Risk taken: quiet victory instead of confrontation, paid off by sustained tension. Slight genre echo of Le Guin’s “The Weaver” but angle shifted to political espionage.</comment>
