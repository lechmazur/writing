<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s solemn vow and tactile weaving give her a clear, consistent motive, but the interiority stays safely meditative; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her on-page choices, so the “earned cost” bar for 8+ isn’t met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the obsidian sculpture clicks into place, supplying a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—her continuing solitary servitude—so closure is valid and on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto’s metallic breath, starlight drip, and kerosene flare are filtered through Elara’s ritual attention, constraining her foot placement and shuttle angle; the final extinguished lamp recharges the setting as custodial silence, meeting the 9+ gate for environment that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Stake—convert dispersed anxiety into solid weight—tightens once via the shuttle-angle micro-choice that precipitates crystallization; cost is the merchant’s dread now ossified and Elara’s perpetuation of her lonely archive, legible though not foregrounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathic transmutation emerges from the calcifying act itself rather than any statement; the final image of her stepping back inside reweights the premise—she carries the un-calcified solitude forward—offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual rhythm, syntax lengthening and compressing with weave tension; whalebone reverie and “shingled hush” coinages feel native to her vocation, no head-hop or register drift, and the voice lands a charged final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses with weave build-up, sentences vary, no loops; figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“shingled hush,” “fractal…nautilus”) and pays off in the bell-closure, so density penalty is waived—only minor scaffold in “cool and familiar” whalebone line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Grief-calcifying weaver is fresh, but the nautilus-fractal and starlit bronze shrine flirt with New-Age lyric defaults; the specificity of “boundary-lessly trapped anxiety” and whalebone shuttle lifts the piece above template, yet it hedges from deeper risk in stakes or world logic.</comment>
