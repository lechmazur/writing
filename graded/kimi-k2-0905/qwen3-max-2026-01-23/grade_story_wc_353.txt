<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “gentle, persistent ache” and synesthetic hearing of silence as a “dissonant chord” are specific and embodied. The single on-page choice—strumming the cracks—grows credibly from that ache and lands with visible cost (tears, siskin response). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, only a steady deepening of attention, so the 9+ internal-conflict gate isn’t met. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy is legible and costly enough for 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final strum reweights the premise—silence is no longer absence but “alive with possibility”—and the cost is the irreversible release of the tree’s last breath of peace. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (quiet → enriched quiet) rather than causal chain drives the turn, and the pattern is taught early via the “held breath” dawn. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. No teleport or retro-patching; the porcelain insulator’s transformation is set up and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grove functions as micro-setting: the stress-cracked sculpture and dew-determined quiet directly constrain how and where Elara can “play.” Sensory selection is POV-filtered—hedgehog snuffle, porcelain coolness, hairline cracks—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: porcelain moves from moss to fissure to rest against sculpture. Setting charges the final image: alders “lean closer,” proving environment shaped the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each strum deepens the chord of shared understanding, narrowing the option to stop without silencing the new resonance. The tightening is singular but meaningful; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the tree’s final surrender and Elara’s tears, meeting 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of translated pain rather than statement: silence as collaborative medium, empathy as non-invasive listening. The porcelain insulator’s reprise—artifact of isolation become bridge—reweights the premise without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; the cracks’ song is earned by method shown early. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: “every crack held a song, and every song held a world.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable; perceptual signature is synesthetic and musical—“muted hues,” “suspended note,” “sorrowful score.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breath-like sentences build to the short, petal-light strum. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elara’s artisanal lexicon. Hedgehog and siskin perceptions remain externally plausible, avoiding ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet audible: “time had softened its edges, but a complex cartography of stress cracks mapped its surface like a sorrowful score” does three jobs in one line. Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. One tiny loop: “silence was not an emptiness; it was thick…” restates the same negation. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information yield, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lutherie with dendrochronology—reading tree trauma as musical score—then stages the performance with an electrical insulator turned plectrum; synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk is quiet: no villain, no plot twist, only attention as rebellion. Final reweighting of silence from void to collaborative medium is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars. Could not swap porcelain for random object without breaking metaphoric circuitry.</comment>
