<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush—her rejection of illusion for the feather’s texture is a vivid micro-choice that crystallizes values. The decade of numbness is rendered as bodily weight, not therapy-speak. Only the mother’s hands/clay memory feels briefly generic; a hair more specificity would push this into 9-band. Closure cost is felt: mercury glass abandoned, path taken, no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (stone, feather, atlas, breeze) adds density until the final image reweights “home.” Orientation is clean—mountain-bookstore, night, sub-basement by line 81. Closure is Charged Poise: the ascending corridor reconfigures option-space; cost is the irreversible shedding of the mercury glass. No causality breaks; feather mechanics are seeded early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bookstore-as-mountain is not postcard fluff: sliding shelves grind out a literal new corridor that forces the final ascent. Micro-setting objects—stone, feather, atlas—constrain tactile choices and are re-handled in successive beats. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s seer bias: quicksilver veins before visual color, touch before sight. Only a trace over-reliance on visual metaphors keeps this shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled in line 69 and tightens when the stone demands a raw memory. Escalation is textural: each handled object increases emotional voltage until renunciation of illusion becomes the only viable stance. Cost is visible: tears, the abandoned glass, the narrow upward path. Slight reserve: the external world beyond the mountain never pressures back, so stakes remain internally bounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars, not slogans: the obsidian disc literally carries hearth-meaning in quicksilver veins. Final projection—“Home is the shape your love leaves upon the world”—is earned by the clay-humming memory and the shedding of comforting illusion. No moralizing paragraph; the mountain’s groan answers the thematic question non-literally. Avoids sentimentality by keeping the mother’s song untranslated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays consistent; perceptual signature is mercury-glass refraction even after the glass is set aside. Syntax lengthens under tenderness (“impossibly soft barbules”) then shortens at pain surge, mirroring emotional respiration. Diction stays within a seer’s lexicon—celestial mechanics, glyphs, quicksilver—without forced antiquity. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; compression is pattern-taught by the numbered parenthetical timestamps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence layers object, history, and emotional charge without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors in the climax, both clean (“sharp as shattered glass,” “cleaning rain”). One mixed echo—“hidden thunder” used twice—stays just under penalty threshold because it reweights at closure. Minor paraphrase risk in “decade of dust” could be sharper, but rhythm propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mercury-glass seer + language-obsidian is a fresh synthesis of oracle and linguist tropes; the feather-as-interface avoids typical blood-price cliché. Mountain bookstore that physically rearranges itself converts setting into antagonist-like pressure without personification. Risk taken in lyric numerology (parenthetical counts) pays off by teaching accumulative pattern. Only the mother’s clay-humming approaches familiar hearth-iconography, but the lost phoneme keeps it specific.</comment>
