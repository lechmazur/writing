<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is consistently grounded in sensory action (lens-weighing, ticket-collecting), and her final projection choice carries visible relational cost when Kael steps into light. “Passive observation was complicity” crystallizes motive, yet the beat remains one-note; no contradictory impulse complicates her arc. Kael’s single tear and palm-press are sufficient embodied change, but his silence still reads as convenient rather than pressured flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the forecourt becomes a living gallery, mistrust dissolves, and the mirrored key charges the final image with earned cost. Causal chain—lens → projected symbol → Kael’s public recognition—holds without gaps; no teleported information. Orientation is swift; crystals, rain, and registrar anchor by line 6. Accumulation lens dominates; pattern of nightly tickets → single projection → community garden of light tightens meaningfully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal spires, rain-slick cobbles, and dew-soft paper are filtered through Elara’s night-registrar attention; each detail returns to constrain her method (wet ticket as canvas, moonlit quartz as screen). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to dais to archway. Micro-setting—the lens and ticket doubling as screen and seed—directly enables climax. Environment’s harmonic hum threads atmosphere into theme of unspoken resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw communal mistrust—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elara decides public exposure is the only non-complicit path. One meaningful escalation: private reading → communal projection; option to remain hidden is foreclosed once moonlight hits crystal. Cost is legible in Kael’s tear and the risk of public shame; no coincidence resolves tension. Pressure remains accumulative/textural rather than adversarial, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transparency as liberation emerges through image sequence (broken bridge → mended bridge) rather than assertion. Final “gallery of shared vulnerability” reweights early secrecy without moralizing. Subtext operates in doodle symbols and silent nod, inviting reflection on what languageless honesty can bear. Ambiguity is purposeful: crystals still hum mystery even after mistrust recedes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s selective perception; diction (“crystal whispering,” “ambiguously clear”) is consistent and motivated by registrar precision. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, then compresses at projection moment, echoing emotional pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet skipped. Patterned elision (“after words became unnecessary”) is taught early and paid off in wordless closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare but purposeful—“veil of starlight,” “fortress of isolation”—without purple overload. Information density strong: one sentence often layers sensory detail, motive, and world rule. Minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to hold their breath”) but occurs in low-pressure beat; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise of post-linguistic reconciliation through recycled cinema lens and rain-lit quartz feels non-obvious and specific. Ticket-doodle language sidesteps clichéd diary trope; public projection transforms private marginalia into communal ritual. Risk in abolishing spoken language could have flattened conflict, but piece commits fully, letting symbols carry weight. Final gallery of mended bridges reframes familiar trust motif into fresh visual covenant.</comment>
