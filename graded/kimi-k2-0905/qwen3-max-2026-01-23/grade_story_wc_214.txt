<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically sustained, but the janitor’s only micro-choice—tracing a meteor with a fingertip—never risks tangible cost; the tear is performed, not embodied under pressure. Trait labels (“spiritually curious”) are repeated instead of revealed through contradictory action. No relational crucible or status shift is possible in solo POV, yet even internal contradiction stays static. The arc lands in Earned Stasis, but the cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern-glass reflection reframes vulnerability as strength, paying off the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. However, the causal chain is loose—meteor watching does not tighten options, merely deepens mood—so the ending feels inevitable only within its lyric register, not within plot logic. No persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station is sketched with spare, star-lit specificity; the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final epiphany. Sensory hierarchy favors visual awe over tactile lived-in detail, acceptable for a contemplative shard. Spatial choreography is immaculate in a single-body scene. The dome, console hum, and dust motes all mirror internal stillness without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is declared early and reasserted at closure, but no middle beat tests or narrows that abstraction. The meteor shower intensifies mood, not options; pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price is paid or foreclosed. Escalation is therefore a cadence shift, not a causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from repeated acts of witnessing and dissolving, avoiding moralizing. The lantern-glass reprise offers a crisp conceptual repricing. Yet the insight is articulated in near-platitudes (“vulnerability was not weakness but the sacred space…”) that slightly over-explain the image. Ambiguity is present but thinned by iterative restatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature: slow, reverent, star-dusted. Syntax modulates from long breathy sentences to fragmentary peaks (“breath held”). No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within the janitor’s humble lexicon while reaching for cosmic scale—an intentional, effective tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere with interior motion. Occasional metaphor stacks (“liquid gold,” “primal elegance”) risk purple, but pattern is taught early and held. No loops or scaffold detected. A single paraphrase loop (“stillness was not neglect—it was a necessary breath…”) slightly dulls momentum mid-climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-janitor-as-mystic is a fresh angle; the choice to equate floor-sweeping with star-tending rescues the trope from mere whimsy. Specificity of the lantern-glass reflection transforms familiar vulnerability thesis into a charged image. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than plot daring—but coherence justifies the gamble. Could swap setting with another isolated outpost, so freshness is partly contingent on voice, not premise alone.</comment>
