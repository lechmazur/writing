<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—reverence vs. the ache of erasure—stays embodied in tactile memory (rope hemp, pipe tobacco). The final act of lodging the shard is a credible renunciation that costs her sole talisman, earned by the triptych of sensory anchors. One micro-choice per painting keeps pressure alive. No status crucible with Cora, but the solitary POV holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each canvas adds density until the lens fragment crystallizes as key, tightening the stake from “remember” to “restore.” Closure is a Charged Poise—shard locked into frame, history re-inlaid in the world—cost is the loss of her private relic. Causality holds: because she finds three hidden details, therefore she surrenders the fragment. No orientation debt; skyline market anchored by word 34.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop market, body-as-setting (pocket, ribs), and the shard as micro-setting all constrain movement and final choice. Sensory hierarchy (comet dust, moth-wing charts) filters through translator’s bias. The niche in the frame literally guides the climactic placement. Weather absent but not needed; spatial tracking clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“resurrect Hemlock’s humanity”—tightens once per painting until the shard’s surrender forecloses her keeping it. No antagonist; pressure is ontological erasure. One visible price: loss of the fragment she once clutched. Escalation is accumulative densification, coherent under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—“overlooked histories breathe in hidden details”—emerges through knot, sparrow, star, never abstract assertion. Final image of shard in frame reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of obsolescence vs. stewardship is carried in Hemlock’s cuff constellation. Resonant, non-literal answer delivered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains translator’s perceptual signature: “scent of crushed comet dust,” “quiet hum beneath her ribs.” Rhythm modulates—long breath for memory, staccato for recognition. No dialogue overload; Cora’s two lines carry indirection. Compression taught early (“bottled echoes”) and paid off in “eternal instant.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>No loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task (“Her fingers closed around the lighthouse lens fragment tucked in her pocket, its surface cool and strangely alive”). Figurative layer is selective, never density-clogged. Opening and closing lines bookend with propulsion. Pronoun, tense, spatial sequence clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise—“between-worlds translator” restoring obliterated histories via painted micro-details—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk of overt lyricism is calmed by concrete anchors (knot, sparrow, star). Not a simple allegory; specifics resist name-swap test. Transformation arises from translator’s vocation, not generic quest.</comment>
