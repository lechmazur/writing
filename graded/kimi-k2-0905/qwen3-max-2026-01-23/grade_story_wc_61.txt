<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific and emotionally embodied; the gear-handling micro-choices visibly enact her ancestral dread. The "fireless" imperative is anchored to a concrete family scar, giving her renunciation at the end a hereditary cost that feels earned. Voice remains consistent, but the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, slightly thinning the crucible pressure band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is announced by the first petal sigh and holds: each sonar ping thickens pattern density until the final wave re-weights the stake with a visible dawn of nurturing stars. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elara turns homeward, gear humming, options re-crystallised around cyclical custodianship rather than conquest. Cost is unmistakable—perpetual vigilance—rendered in the image of "endless repetition" she must gift her daughter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nebular "petals" act as both atmosphere and micro-setting: their glow/opacity literally guides every course correction, while the gear-as-tool constrains alignment tolerance. Spatial choreography is dream-clear—petals drift, pings ripple, distances track. Sensory economy favors visual/kinaesthetic harmonics, perfectly biased to an electromagnetic being. The final dawn image is charged, not decorative, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens through incremental ping-tests; one mis-alignment could ignite catastrophe, a visceral price. Escalation is textural: each successful ping layers ancestral confidence yet highlights fragility, culminating in the sustainable dawn. Agency is present (gear adjustments, ping emission), but the absence of an opposing force keeps pressure poetic rather than dramatically fierce.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance as devotion rather than dominion—emerges through recursive imagery of falling petals and fractal gear teeth. The quiet ending refuses triumphalist fire, offering instead "loving, repeated effort" as the only infinity mortals can tend. No moral is stated; the final petal-sigh reprises the first, re-weighted with acceptance. Subtext of maternal transmission is carried by the daughter mention, avoiding overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is starlight-bright, syntactically stratified: long nebulous clauses that bloom then compact into tactile clicks of brass. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara "feels" vibrations, "tastes" gas densities, never drifts into humanoid cliché. Compression like "charred silence" teaches the pattern early and pays off at every petal flare. No dialogue, so no register clash; lyric mode stays legible under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm ripples like the pings it describes—sentence length undulates, paragraph cuts land on image beats. Figurative threads (petals, gears, starlight tears) recur with purpose, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is repeated as a refrain; it accrues mantra force but edges toward template cadence, preventing full 9.0. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic gardener and antique brass gear is startling yet inevitable; the premise reframes infinity as maintenance, not conquest. Familiar tropes—ancestral duty, nebula journey—are re-wired through sonar cartography and fireless photosynthesis, producing a fresh emotional calculus. Risk in lyric repetition pays off by making the refrain feel like orbital recurrence. Conceptual integrity never waivers; no late rule inventions.</comment>
