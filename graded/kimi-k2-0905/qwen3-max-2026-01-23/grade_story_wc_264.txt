<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Guard’s dreamless vow and quantum-gardener identity are vivid, but interior contradiction is missing; no moment where duty to archive conflicts with private need. Micro-choice in hollow—kneel, unstrap, hum—is present yet cost is abstract (emptiness as shield). Endurance reads as quiet saintliness rather than flawed, risky commitment. Needed: one beat where archive’s “occasionally everywhere” threatens to overwrite his own mind, forcing a renunciation that scars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: flame anchors, archive ripples, chess-clock seed re-orients time from tombstone to branching. Accumulative lens holds—each spark is a textured deposit brightening the dune-pattern. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no flesh or memory actually surrendered. Still, final image reweights the frozen midnight rule-set without breaking taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent dune, obsidian archive, and chess clock create a micro-setting trilogy that constrains every move. Sand’s glow and the hollow’s dark supply the only resources—light to spread, shadow to conquer. Spatial choreography is clean: step, sink, kneel, place, stand, walk. Environment mirrors internal blankness without overt symbolism, charging the final beacon image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seed light into void—is signaled early and tightens once: hollow resists glow, forcing focused charm. Stakes remain abstract (“fragile light vs. void”) rather than personal; no fear that guard himself might extinguish. Escalation is textural—density of blooms increases—but options don’t narrow; same method repeats. Cost is offloaded to future children; guard loses nothing concrete now.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultivation-after-apocalypse emerges through repeated cultivation acts, not statement. Chess clock’s re-seeding reframes ending without moralizing. Lullaby motif threads loss and hope, reweighting itself from fracture to continuity. Ambiguity remains—will archive overwrite gardener?—inviting reflection without tidy answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: sand “blooms,” time “learns to bloom,” dune “leans.” Syntax lengthens with breathy prepositional phrases, mirroring wave-function diffusion. No head-hop; dreamless interiority stays consistently hollow. Compression (“occasionally everywhere”) is taught by line 4 and pays off in resonance beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses—long sentences swell, short sparks punctuate. No loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative muddle absent; vehicles (light, breath, water) stay consistent. Minor scaffold: “step by step” and “spark by spark” pairings verge on formula but serve lullaby cadence, forgiven at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-forest quantum-gardener is fresh synthesis; wave-function horticulture weaponizes physics as lyric. Frozen chess-clock seed subverts doomsday trope into arboreal hope. Risk in dreamless protagonist could flatten emotion, but hollowing is justified as archive protection. Concept commits fully—no retreat to conventional eco-parable.</comment>
