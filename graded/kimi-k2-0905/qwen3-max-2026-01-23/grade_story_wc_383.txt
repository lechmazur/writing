<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—empiricist performing a ritual—drives every beat; the micro-choice to hum C while tears fall embodies the stakes. The final burial of the shell beneath Kael’s lilac is a credibly costly renunciation. Only the “ghostly resolve” label at climax nicks perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal tucked over heart reweights solitude into self-shelter with felt cost (“weight dissolved”). Causal chain holds—skeptic convinced by shell’s private whispers, resonance rods stabilize grief, dawn timing required—no breaks. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 4; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Velvet moss, quartz rods, and dew choreography constrain kneeling, humming, burial—every tactile detail filters through Elara’s empirical bias. The lilac bush as micro-setting returns to charge the final image. Garden never feels generic; specificity stays within 800-word economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens once: the humming beat forces her to release the memory into crystal, foreclosing endless mourning. Cost is visible (tears, cooled shell, buried fragment). No reversal needed; single meaningful deepening satisfies short-form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from seed-to-shelter motif reframed in Kael’s echo: memories must be planted, not quarantined. No moralizing; the dawn image reweights the concept without statement. Subtext of empirical mind succumbing to harmonic ritual enriches skepticism theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—soil scent, bone-felt C, quartz glare. Syntax lengthens under emotion then compresses at climax, mirroring resonance build-up. No head-hop; register consistent with scientist-turned-ritualist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative density peaks at “tragically radiant supernova” but pattern-taught by earlier light imagery, so forgiven. Strong verbs (“tucked,” “bled,” “carved”) propel momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emotional-archiving via harmonic quartz is fresh synthesis of sci-fi and elegy; trope of memory-transfer made specific through Kael’s documented frequencies. Risky lyric escalation pays off. Could edge higher if resonance rules carried one more concrete constraint.</comment>
