<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—terror of dissolution vs. need to transmute grief—drives every micro-choice; the ritual stitches memory to fracture with visible cost. The final “warm sparrow” in his palm is earned renunciation: workshop lost, meaning salvaged. No stock labels; embodiment is precise (“tears cutting paths through grime”). Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each quilted memory adds density until the cadence shift at the heart-pockmark beat reweights stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: acid still, gears silent, Kael holding reconfigured meaning—cost is the imminent death of the workshop yet internal sanctuary secured. Causality intact: no teleporting props, no convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 30; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Workshop-as-body: acid sea, sheared brass, ozone scent constrain every move; the statue’s pockmarks function as topographic map and stitching template. Micro-setting (ceramic sparrow) becomes the final sanctuary—object-as-setting charges closure. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors Kael’s narrowing perception under duress. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning before annihilation—signaled line 4; pressure tightens via each gold seam until the mirror-calm sea externalizes the internal shift. One meaningful deepening: heart-pockmark beat narrows options to remember wholeness, not breaking. No external coincidence resolves; agency is the ritual narration itself. Cost legible: workshop still doomed, peace purchased.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from kintsugi practice: fractures are history, not failure. Final image reweights prior breaks as light—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo; subtext lives in gesture (sealing lips, tremor in hands). Ambiguity preserved: salvation is internal, external ruin imminent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is alchemical-visionary (“luminous gold resin,” “ghost of her lavender soap”). Rhythm accelerates with breathless anaphora during ritual, then lengthens into calm—prose as character. No head-hopping; knowledge stays Kael-bound. Distinct diction sustained under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is patterned (kintsugi metaphors) and paid off. Strong verbs (“sheared,” “hissed,” “quilted”) carry density. No register drift; technical terms (chronometers, resin) serve POV. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with crisis then serenity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi + memory-quilting + floating acid workshop yields non-obvious emotional physics. Risk-taking—entire crisis resolved via interior ritual—pays off because closure reweights external catastrophe into internal sanctuary. No derivative premise; alcraft feels lived-in, not borrowed. Specificity of Lyra’s laughter “ringing like bells” prevents generic template.</comment>
