<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity is anchored in a concrete memory of Lyra’s seed-box, giving his decryption attempt emotional stakes. The beat where he dons the goggles is micro-choice that tilts present risk; the moment he reads the captain’s decoded grief, interiority and embodied reaction ("throat tightened") show contradictory impulses—duty vs. longing—alive in scene. Final stance of "carrying wisdom" is earned; cost is felt through the shift from detached courier to bearer of another’s grief. No secondary on-page character, so status crucible skipped; -0.2 for slight convenience of perfect cipher fit first try.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael peers through goggles, therefore cipher yields, therefore he re-weights his own loss. Orientation (who/where/when) locked by word 26. Closure is Charged Poise: elevator arrival halts action but options are reconfigured—he now carries an internal compass at visible cost ("heavier and lighter")—cost legible on page. One loop of "ascending servant / descending servants" capped at -0.2; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting (icebound spire, brass elevator, scattered glacier-light) constrains choice: the moving elevator literally supplies the only angle of refracted light that decodes diary—environment enables the pivotal beat. Micro-setting (velvet bench, porthole) tracks clean; glacier is reused anchor, not postcard. Sensory hierarchy favors sight but filtered through Kael’s tool-use; no static white-room. Tool (goggles) qualifies as micro-setting that charges final image; qualifies for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—personal need to see "joy beneath anguish"—is signalled early and tested once: the diary decode tightens his emotional knowledge and forces a shift in vocational identity from anonymous courier to keeper of another’s grief. Agency is attention/renunciation: he completes the delivery but can no longer remain detached—on-page cost is the loaded silence he carries out. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational under consistent lens. Could wish for one additional mid-scene obstacle to push band higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete decryption episodes: love persists in loss, joy found inside sorrow. No direct thesis statement; captain’s decoded line provides resonant non-literal answer. Image of "scattered light" reappears with reweighted meaning at closure, charging final beat. Emotional aftereffect credible; complexity retained—no tidy moral. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustained; perceptual signature distinct—Kael registers starch on fabric, frost refracted through quartz, "cloud-whales," aligning with servant’s tactile attentiveness. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped phrases under reveal. Free indirect clean ("he would continue his climb..."). No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Filter verbs minimal, voice-motivated. Psychic distance contracts appropriately at decryption climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job, sensory cue, and emotional tilt. Figurative control disciplined—glacier light as decoder is concrete, not purple. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Paragraph cuts tight; each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Read-aloud rhythm varies; opening and closing lines serve as frame hinges. Qualifies for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—servant decoding captains’ grief via refracted light in elevator—offers fresh angle on "found manuscript" trope. Goggles as decryption lens repurposes mundane tool into emotional scope; specificity prevents swap-out. Risk (single-scene lyric lift) pays off without clarity loss. Not quite revolutionary, but synthesis feels particular and inevitable. Transformation test passed.</comment>
