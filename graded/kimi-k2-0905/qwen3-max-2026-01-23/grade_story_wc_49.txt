<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet but fierce motivation is clear, yet the interiority stays safely abstract ("warm and embracing," "certainty") instead of embodying contradiction or cost; her single micro-choice (return tendril) is gentle, not bearing visible price that forecloses a path. She remains competent and unflawed, so no mistake compounds tension; the arc is linear restoration, not personal reckoning. Earned stasis is achieved, but the absence of internal friction or tangible sacrifice keeps the characterization from high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is replaced by eternal echoes, cost felt through the grapes’ impossible arrival and her tear-tracked dust. Accumulative lens holds: each song verse deepens sensory density until the final alignment stitches meaning into soil. Causality is intact—tendril activation because/therefore follows song and timing—no convenient amnesia or off-stage fixes. Orientation and transitions are clean in the single-scene window; only minor tightening of stakes (no live risk) prevents 9-level punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Verdant arbor is vivid, selective, and purposeful: dew, jasmine, moonlight feed the hush tone and physically guide her kneeling posture; altar cracks, ferns, rosemary changes evolve causally with the golden thread. Micro-setting (vine tendril as handled object) constrains her timing and final placement action. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory selection mirrors POV’s ritual focus. While environment doesn’t threaten her, its restorative reaction makes setting an active witness, satisfying high-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred songs—is signaled early; pressure is the precision timing alignment, not antagonistic opposition. Escalation is textural: denser gold stories, widening botanical revival, humming roots; yet no option narrows or price is exacted from her—success feels inevitable once song starts. Agency is obedience to researched steps rather than a risky improvisation inside uncertainty. Coincidence assists, never complicates; thus tension plateaus beneath high-band demand for a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of cultural remembrance emerges organically from the restorative imagery and song cycle; no explicit moralizing states the thesis. Subtext whispers in the moon’s "final blessing" and the grapes arriving off-season, implying cyclical resilience. Ambiguity is present yet tame—no counter-readings that complicate the restoration. The ending’s golden echoes offer a resonant, non-literal answer, though the lack of personal cost keeps the reweighting gentle rather than profound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric-ritual voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that reflects POV’s vocation; diction ("weathered stone altar," “liquid gold unspooled”) remains consistent with tinkerer-scholar perception. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; psychic distance compresses cleanly at climax. Syntax modulates with breath units matching song phrasing, giving deliberate rhythmic control without algorithmic monotony. The voice feels individual and stable, meeting high-band distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Paragraph and sentence rhythm vary naturally; high density allows image-character-theme to share single lines without scaffolding. Figurative language is selective—vehicles (moon as amber eye, dew as diamonds) stay coherent, no mixed stacks in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no register drift. The prose propels, breathing with the song cadence, achieving near-flawless line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Restoring forgotten songs through melody-activated vine thread offers fresh mythic tech, synthesizing ecological and cultural stakes. Detail is specific to this voice and grove; no trope checklist feel. While thematic arc ("restore lost harmony") is ancient, the sensory embroidery and tinkerer POV personalize it. The risk level is moderate—no structural experimentation—but internal consistency and lush specificity prevent derivative dents.</comment>
