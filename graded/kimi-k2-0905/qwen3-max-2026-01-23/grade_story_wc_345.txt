<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Seven named characters is a crowd at 800 words; only Kael and Lena get micro-choices, the rest are labels. Elara’s altruism is asserted, not tested—she never risks or loses anything. The family’s “single organism” is declared, not dramatized in contradictory action; interiority stays general (“tears mingling with smiles”). Earned stasis is present but thin because the ghost’s exit carries no visible cost to the living.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s harmonic purge is a Decisive Change with felt wonder. Causal chain—mirror alignment → light strike → blight collapse—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; escalation is the single intensification of light and sound. Orientation is swift; world rules float arches, twin suns, chalk messages are taught early and paid off. Only niggle: the bell’s “harmonic key” property is retroactively revealed rather than foreshadowed, a minor causality bump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating stone arches, sapphire pears, and gravity tricks are immediate, tactile, and filter through botanist Lena’s gaze. The bell’s verdigris, moss pedestal, and star-chart etching are worked into action, not backdrop. Environment constrains the climax: mirror angles must fit the arch aperture, so setting directly shapes tactics. Sensory balance favors sight over other senses, but the final image of sapphire butterflies dispersing recharges the orchard’s palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the orchard—signals early; blight tightens once, no reversals. Agency is collective: reexamine bell → salvage mirrors → align light; the tightening is the midnight deadline, not a character trade-off. Cost is aesthetic (wonder, relief) rather than tangible loss; no tool breaks, no relationship frays. Sufficient for 800 words, but the absence of a painful trade-off keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “strangers become family through shared tending” emerges via orchard care, not thesis. Subtext lives in Finn’s chalk glyphs—small acts of trust answering ghostly instruction. Final line “I am with the stars” lets Elara’s absence reweight prior guidance without moralizing. Ambiguity is modest but present: the ghost’s altruism is accepted, never interrogated, leaving faint ethical aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person floats above the group, compressing seven voices into one choral POV; pattern is taught by paragraph-one “gravity played tricks” and holds. Syntax is rhythmic, lightly elevated (“liquid-silver light lanced down”) yet consistent. No head-hopping; interior access is collective, permissible under Track C. Distinct idiom is muted—only Kael’s engineer skepticism briefly individuates—so voice stays competent rather than unforgettable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: no filter stacks, no synonym loops, varied sentence openings. Figurative language is selective—“silent explosions of white and pink” sharpens blossom burst without clutter. One mixed vehicle: “hope felt brambled” is abstract, but the metaphor is seeded early and reprised, so forgiven. Final paragraph contains no artifact; cadence slows to match benediction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard + spectral agronomist + cosmic bell is fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. Star-chart irrigation keyed to a nebula’s midnight angle feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is moderate—lyric collective POV, seven-character mosaic—but pattern is taught and closure legible. Could push further if the ghost’s altruism carried a darker cost or irony.</comment>
