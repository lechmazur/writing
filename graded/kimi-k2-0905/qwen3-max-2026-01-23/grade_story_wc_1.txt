<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “steadily adaptive resilience” is asserted repeatedly yet never dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her anything. The decision to glass-encase the ledger is narrated as inevitability, not a live tension between destroy/transform. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“purpose crystallized”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns act as recursive image that reweights the ledger’s meaning. Closure—Conceptual Repricing—lands when frost etchings teach her to “honor scars” and she commits to a luminous sphere; cost is the irreversible exposure of her studio loss. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props. Causality weak in the inciting torching (off-stage, no motive chain), but pattern coherence at ending keeps lens intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canyon sandstone, frost filaments, and smoke-tanged air are filtered through glass-artist perception: silica/charcoal pairing mirrors her entanglement. Frost cracks act as both map and moral lesson, constraining her final artistic method. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment charges the final image directly, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve or obliterate the ledger—emerges late, after the torching already happened off-page. Escalation is textural: frost patterns deepen associative tension rather than narrowing live options. Visible cost (studio ashes) is retrospective; no new forfeiture at decision beat. Tightening exists but is reflective, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-fracture emerges via frost/ledger/glass triad without explicit moral. Final image reweights earlier “light trapped in silica” motif to “light passing through ash.” Avoids tidy thesis, invites counter-readings on complicity. One thematic echo (“purpose crystallized”) is borderline label-speak, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains glass-artist perceptual signature: “molten silica,” “annealed spirit,” “frozen scripture.” Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences for flight, staccato fragments at dawn. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. One clause drifts toward editorial (“a truth someone feared”) but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm tracks emotional curve; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmospheric charge). Occasional modifier stacks (“profound hush of a quiet canyon under stars that held their breath”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and sustained. No loops or scaffold. Closure line is clean, though “spaces between” verges on aphorism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of frost-etched topography with smuggler code is fresh; turns natural phenomenon into mnemonic device without gimmickry. Glass/charcoal ethical collision grounds novelty in character economy. Meditative transformation of evidence into art object feels inevitable yet non-generic. Risk is moderate; could push further into material process detail.</comment>
