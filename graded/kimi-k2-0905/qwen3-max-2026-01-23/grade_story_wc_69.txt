<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—resigned yet expectant—grounds every micro-choice; the rosette warms in her pocket as embodied cost. Choir members’ shifts from avoidance to steadying harmony are shown through tactile细节 (hand-brush, tear) rather than labels. Final stance crystallizes when she pockets the warmed wood, continuity replacing loss. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” recurs as label; dramatized once, still palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure hits as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rosette flips from loss to continuity under moonlight, felt cost legible in shared breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each subtracted silence deepens pattern until melody dissolves past hatred. One transition (weeks-later shard) is taught early by white-space break; causality intact. Slight orientation lag at 130 words but anchors serve the final hush—waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Velvet library’s hush, amber dust, frost on leaded glass filter through Elara’s attentive bias; space literally enables subtraction method. Micro-setting of the rosette charges final image—wood warms against skin, resonant emptiness made tangible. Seasonal detail mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; bodies circle table, hands brush, no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braid voices amid hatred—tightens through subtractive practice; each silent rehearsal forecloses retaliation as live option. Visible cost: Liam’s falter, Anya’s steadying hum, tear on Elara’s cheek—hatred unlearned note by note. One deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Pressure coherent, escalation subtle but undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture—rosette shifts from vanishing to continuity; no moral spoken. Subtext in Liam’s orchard line reweights years of grievance into shared memory. Final moonlit breath offers conceptual repricing: harmony is space-making, not victory. Avoids tidy sentiment; ambiguity lingers in winter ahead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter: “voice low as settling snow” marks idiom. Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-sentence paragraphs mimic held breath. No head-hop; choral voices remain external, reported through her perception. Distinct texture sustained; occasional poetic lift stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “crimson leaves pressed against the leaded windows like stained glass” does atmospheric and temporal work in one stroke. Varied sentence length mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence detected. One paraphrase loop—“traveled stillness” repeated thrice—minor, does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear clean; metaphor vehicles coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: harmony achieved by subtracting, not adding—quiet inversion of conflict-resolution trope. Ro-stette-as-resonant-void transcends generic heirloom. Specific orchard graft detail roots feud in lived history. Risk modest but coherent; could push further into sonic experiment.</comment>
