<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for origin yet worshipping void—remains vivid; the act of “quantifying absence” externalizes her micro-choices with tactile precision. Embodied cost arrives when the first incision brands the slate and the parole flares, foreclosing pure emptiness. One character, no status crucible, but the earned renunciation of untouched blankness carries sufficient weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens: because she measures absence, therefore she can dare the first mark → parole ignites → customer enters. Orientation anchored by 120 words; closure is a Charged Poise where parole becomes tangible covenant with visible cost—the moonlight flash and Elara’s irreversible incision. One shard; meaningful tightening legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard, levitating cloud-sea, bottled moonlight, obsidian slate: each object is tactile, POV-filtered, and ultimately constrains the final gesture (the incision ignites bottled light). Spatial choreography stays clean; micro-setting (pedestal of mist, velvet lining) directly steadies her hand. Selective sensory economy keeps atmosphere synced to her singular goal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the living origin point—tightens when absence is quantified and the slate must be violated; parole’s ignition embodies the price. Single escalation beat suffices; causality intact, options narrowed: blankness is lost forever. Cost is dramatized, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: genesis equals the decisive cut, not any external archive. Subtext carried in silence-data, moonlight-swirl, and the parole’s contingency; no explicit moral. Final reconfiguration—void is fertile only once chosen—reweights earlier glass-archive imagery without abstraction. Insight earned through material act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature (“cool as a forgotten secret”) fuses tactile and emotional registers. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for lull, clipped scrap for incision—mirrors tension. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; prose texture remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: each sentence adds sensorial, emotional, or causal data; minimal scaffolding. Metaphors stay internally coherent (void as fertile ground, moonlight as liquid shadow). Occasional elevated register (“luminous manuscripts”) reads intentional to celestial locale. No loops/paraphrase in peak beat; closure image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Conceptual fusion—retail shop + ontological quest—feels fresh; “quantified absence” as method grounds abstraction in sensory ritual. Tropes (floating library, bottled moon) are retooled through precise technical actions. Transformation test fails if incision removed, indicating genuine integration. Risk evident but safe middle visible in ornamental “woven mist” phrasings.</comment>
