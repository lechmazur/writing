<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heartbreak→naming imperative is clear and embodied in micro-choices (positioning the prism, channeling grief into each beam). Interiority stays concrete, but the repeated “echo of sacrifice” phrase edges toward label-speak, slightly dulling the final crystallization beat. Still, the renunciation of wordless grief carries visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of naming→crystallizing tightens stakes by reweighting memory into tangible legacy. Orientation locked by 50 wds; closure is earned Resonant Reconfiguration—diamond holding starlight—where cost is legible in the final image. Causality is interior but coherent under the chosen lens; no break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory and prism function as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move; dusk’s scattered light is the world-rule pivot. Sensory selection stays narrow to Kael’s reaper perception—cool stone, amber rays, energy-tears—mirroring internal shift without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no drifting anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“name the deepest fear or stay hollow”—is signaled early and tightened with each crystal birth; options narrow as light fades. Each naming costs Kael a piece of unvoiced grief, price visible in the growing rainbow of stones. Agency is cumulative, not causal, but escalation meets lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the refracted sequence: naming transmutes terror into honored memory, answering Elara’s belief without moralizing. Final diamond reweights “Unmourned Goodbyes” from void to preserved starlight, offering resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo in closing lines; ambiguity lingers within tight focus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; reaper POV filters diction through skeletal shadow, energy-tears, and astral vocabulary. Syntax lengthens then compresses with crystallizing beats, mirroring tension. No head-hop; patterned elision (“echo of sacrifice”) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional, participial, and simple clauses in deliberate sequence. No looped stems or mixed metaphors; figurative load reserved for transformation beats, never clutters causality. High information density—each line advances image or interior shift. Minor purple tinge in “impossible clarity” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of reaper vocation with astronomical grief-ritual feels inevitable yet fresh; star-charted ocean, ink beasts turned crystal constitute specific synthesis rather than checklist. Conceptual risk—emotional alchemy via scattered light—commits fully and lands coherent under accumulative lens. Could not swap names/places without collapsing metaphoric architecture.</comment>
