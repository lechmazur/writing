<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is concrete—kitchen discipline anchoring the surreal gift—and the embodied cost of tasting exile’s regret lands cleanly. The micro-choice to “cook” remorse fuses vocation and wound, earning the stoic final stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; solo arc holds. Minor slip: “sandpaper rough memories” is repeated label-speak near climax, dulling edge −0.2.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he tastes regret in the pool, therefore he digs, therefore he subsumes, therefore the fortress wakes lighter. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—ice melts, weight settles in his bones—foreclosing the option to remain untouched. One transition (courtyard → dune) is legible; orientation anchored by 120 words. Accumulation cap −0.3 for one off-page king memory that could feel teleported.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desert-after-rain is visceral: damp sandstone scent, cereus perfume, starlit ice. Micro-setting tool—coral arch—constrains the final act: its cold demands bare-hand contact, charging the image. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms. Lyric compression taught early and paid off; no info stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he absorb or refuse the king’s remorse—signaled by tidal pool regret. Mid-scene tightening: ice groans, weight settles, option to retreat vanishes. Cost legible in bone-brittle ache. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Coincidence absent; agency drives turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—remorse can be refined, not erased—emerges through culinary alchemy of grief, never stated. Final amber drop reweights coral from vault to vessel of peace, offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact. One abstract phrase “tempered truth” flirts with echo −0.1.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aris’s perceptual spice-rack idiom; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with pressure—fragments under ice-groan, elongation during slow exhale. Filter verbs sparing and voice-motivated. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience “the fortress would wake lighter”; minor distance slip −0.2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors consistent—culinary, geological, aquatic—without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Strong verbs dominate; punctuation clean. Final line cadence crystallizes closure. Hairline slip: “liquid sky” cliché −0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Memory-tasting chef who literally digests remorse is fresh; coral-ice vault beneath desert dunes compounds surprise. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight via tidal pool mapping. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off. One prior echo—Gaimanesque memory-eater—still sufficiently transformed +0.3.</comment>
