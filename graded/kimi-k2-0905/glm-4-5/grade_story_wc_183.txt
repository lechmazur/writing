<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyric and specific (“homesick for lives she had never lived”), but the beat-work is thin: she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The climactic “pressing palm to tree” is passive reception, not active decision, so the Earned Stasis feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she becomes the ship’s chronicler—yet the causal chain is foggy: the emerald card dissolves because the text says so, not because she risks or forfeits anything. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of memory-thread accumulation holds, but the final reweighting is more asserted than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Derelict carnival ship is vividly rendered through Elara’s biased eye—faded murals that “move in the corner of vision,” rusty hull echoing. The unnamed emerald tree finally charges the image, but earlier spatial anchors (deck / ballroom / corridor) blur together; a single distance or layout cue would have cemented choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover her own identity by giving voice to forgotten names—is declared early, yet pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical. No live option is foreclosed; she drifts into revelation rather than choosing under duress, so escalation plateaus at mood-level rather than stakes-level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed identity and surrogate memory emerges organically from the memory-thread conceit; the final image of Elara dissolving into the narrative web offers quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the lovers’ and tightrope walker’s fragments, but the thematic return would sharpen if one of those threads visibly altered her next move.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent lyric-fantastic with purposeful compression (“unkindled solace,” “blissfully aberrant”). Perceptual signature is stable—Elara notices motion in periphery, feels alien-green warmth—but syntax occasionally drifts into repetitive anaphora (“Each narrative thread… Each narrative thread”) that flattens rhythm rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—and while most cohere, mixed vehicles (“tightrope of memory wound around consciousness”) risk abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but overwriting in peak beat dulls the closure image; thinning one descriptor every three sentences would restore propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chimera-twin conceit is refreshed: she collects not people but their orphaned memories aboard a ghost carnival ship. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—emerald card as synaptic key, tree as neural net—yet the risk of pure lyric mode is that emotional stakes stay diffuse; still, the specificity of “garden of forgotten names” lingers memorably.</comment>
