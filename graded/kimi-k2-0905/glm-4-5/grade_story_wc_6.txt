<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the foreign coin…tapped against her chest”), motives are anchored to the paradox of arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter, and micro-choices (wrapping grafts, sprinkling black sand) enact the “scars can sing” belief. However, the father remains off-stage, so the crucial status/relationship crucible is only implicit; the emotional cost is felt but not complicated by live opposition, capping advancement to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mosaic structure (garden rescue → lagoon reverie → dawn return) teaches its pattern early and lands a resonant reconfiguration: Maya sees in the lagoon mirror that her father’s gift now nourishes life, not destruction. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each shard adds density until the final image reprices the meaning of black sand and coin. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—she accepts perpetual reconciliation with her father’s legacy—so closure is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Selective, POV-filtered detail (“smoke-choked streets,” “obsidian lagoon mirrored an emerging sun”) keeps atmosphere taut; the garden, lagoon, and black sand function as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; weather is causal (wind shift ordered evacuation). The foreign coin and volcanic sand meet the 9+ gate by charging the final image, but one descriptive lapse—“kelp-drift peace” is evocative yet abstract—stops this just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing via rescued grafts—signals early; escalation is textural: encroaching fire tightens until embers land in the garden, forcing the blanket shield. Agency is present yet secondary to atmospheric pressure; the wind/cloud migration complicates but does not narrow options meaningfully. A visible price (risking safety for plants) is paid, yet the external fire is the pivot, not a character-driven reversal, holding this in the low-8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the grafts and black-sand returns; no explicit moralizing. Motif of “singing scars” is repriced in the final lagoon image without stated thesis. Subtextual tension—using father’s destructive gift to foster life—remains complex, resisting tidy redemption. One slight thematic echo (“Scars can sing,” repeated aloud) dampens full transcendence into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person deep POV maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is specific (“black sand…rattling in the small pouch”). Sentence rhythm modulates with scene tempo, breathing during lagoon calm, compressing during ember fall. No dialogue appears; thus no voice-distinction test. One filter-verb cluster (“she saw…she touched…she whispered”) in the closing cadence keeps this just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean with high density; figurative language is purposeful, not overwrought. No loops or synonym churn detected. Occasional template pattern (“Maya…as she…”) in three adjacent sentences mid-story momentarily drums; small scaffold phrases (“the obsidian lagoon reflected…”) recur. These micro-ripples do not touch closure, so the cap stays above 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing arsonist’s daughter + firefighter + botanical grafting supplies freshness; volcanic black sand as nurturer is a non-obvious inversion. The cloud-migration timeframe feels specific to this locale. While the “scars can sing” coinage flirts with aphorism, the earned lagoon reprise grounds it. Slight risk in lyric mosaic form is well-executed, meriting upper-8 recognition.</comment>
