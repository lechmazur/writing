<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured through glass-maker perception and dawn solitude, but her “noctilucent reckonings” remain abstract label-speak; the pond-stone moment supplies one embodied choice that crystallizes her stance, yet no secondary pressure tests her. The arc lands in CRR, yet the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on her body or craft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyric dawn details layer until the pond ritual reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she will now “transform perspectives,” not just glass—arriving with conceptual cost. Setup anchors who/where by ~60 words; orientation clear. One risk: the causal chain between stone-toss and epiphany is asserted, not narrowed by tangible obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Selective glass-worker sensory filter—light through panes, calloused palms—threads every paragraph; Pearl Bay is sketched in pearl-metaphor and dew-web refractions that mirror internal shift. The prism-atrium is micro-setting-as-object, returning in the final line to charge CR. Spatial choreography stays clean; no credibility errors. Environment could more directly constrain a tool-choice, but refracted light is purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when pond rings externalize the question. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than antagonistic clash; cost is opportunity/time foregone in pre-dawn solitude. Sufficient single deepening for lyric length, though external stakes remain abstract; no visible material loss alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from light-fracture imagery without sermon: mundane made numinous. The prism-atrium and ripples reconfigure meaning; no tidy moral. Subtext lives in silence and refraction rather than articulated insight. Final image reweights prior glasswork as “changed hearts,” avoiding thematic echo penalty, though “masterpiece… in opened eyes” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s glass-eye perception; syntax lengthens in calmer cadence, shortens at water’s edge. Diction—“noctilucent reckonings,” “prism atrium”—leans poetic yet remains within a glazier’s plausible lexicon. Distinct texture, no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance. Minor cadence repetition (“between…” anaphora) is purposeful, pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: sensory detail carries double duty for atmosphere and thematic refraction. Metaphors stay coherent (light-through-glass). A few soft loops—“between the…” triplets and “countless days” echo—but none obscure causality or dull closure image. Peak beat avoids purple overload; rhythm breathes with dawn pacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Harbor glazier as contemplative seer is fresh; pond-ripple divination reframes familiar nature-moment. Combination of craft-specific perception with lyric accumulation rather than causal plot risks templated “quiet epiphany” territory, yet specificity of glass vocabulary and dawn-light physics lifts it. No close famous-line echoes; premise could swap names but sensory filter is individual.</comment>
