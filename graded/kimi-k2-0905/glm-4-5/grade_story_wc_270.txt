<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s insurgent streak and plant-telepathy are vivid, but the interior contradiction between scoffing at prophecy and embracing “implanted destiny” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final acceptance feels smoothed rather than wrested. Embodied emotion is strong (weathered hands on rock, warmth of amber), yet the micro-choice to speak the script is not framed as a genuine risk or forfeiture—no visible cost or fear of failure—so the Earned Stasis is only half-charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: plant-whispers → cave → embryo → kite-script → voiced key → chamber opens. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—tradition must evolve or die—made legible the instant Maya feels the embryo’s “warm and alive” weight. Orientation is clean within 60 words; only nitpick is the kite arriving by “sudden gust” which momentarily softens causality, but the plants immediately validate it, keeping lens intact.</comment>

<comment>Hot-spring steam, obsidian chamber, and volcanic rock are tactile and selective; geothermal power links directly to community stakes. The kite-tail script functions as micro-setting object that constrains the final action—no script, no open—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent from surface to crevice to chamber; only the abandoned kite’s exact prior location is fuzzy, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. fossilize it—is signaled early and tightens when the embryo’s life becomes contingent on Maya’s voice. One meaningful escalation: weeks of frustration compress into the decoded script, which forces the irreversible act of speaking aloud. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no personal injury—but the “warm and alive” transfer of embryo to hands makes the stakes felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition as living organism, not museum relic. The embryo image reweights “heritage” from static preservation to gestational risk. Final image of bringing “the embryo into the light” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermon. Only restraint: a hint of thematic echo in “evolve it with intent” that flirts with prompt-language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers close to Maya’s sensorium—steam parts “as if in recognition,” script “burns in her mind.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action, reflecting her age and urgency. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the diction stays within an elder’s lived lexicon except for one elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing” risk in “map of consciousness itself,” quickly re-grounded by tactile payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (steam as breath of earth) are spare and coherent. One mixed vehicle: “sound like thunder” for obsidian cracking risks cliché, but the immediacy of the next sentence rescues it. Information density high—every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes—earning its momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of plant-telepathy, geothermal insurgency, and linguistic cryptogram feels fresh yet inevitable. The kite-script as living key transforms a child’s toy into cultural genome, avoiding generic MacGuffin. Risk is present but moderate; the piece could push further into volcanic body-horror or council retaliation. Still, the synthesis of eco-science and mythic destiny is memorable and specific to this voice.</comment>
