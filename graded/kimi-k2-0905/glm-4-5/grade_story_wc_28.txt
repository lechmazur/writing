<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingers “tracing,” the tessera “warming”—and his contradictory impulse to mourn yet rebuild is held in scene. The final micro-choice (placing the tile, whispering “Samarkhand”) is motivated by every prior beat; the cost is the emotional exposure of standing alone in the ashes while others watch. No diagnostic label-speak; compassion is shown through tactile ritual, not abstract assertion. Flaw: the “gentle radical” tag is asserted twice rather than revealed through friction with on-page dissenters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the act of renaming re-weights the ruins from dead history to living city, felt cost = Elias’s solitary vulnerability under a broken sky. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; the mosaic’s accumulating touches build density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (ancient plaza, shattered sky, after fire). No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught by the second paragraph and held to last line. Cost proof: “the tessera seemed brighter” – the plaza’s new light is the visible price of his mercy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Setting moves from generic ruin to specific body-scale map: chipped lines become “language,” stepping stone becomes ritual stage. Shattered sky and ash wind are filtered through Elias’s retrocognitive bias—he sees laughter-ghosts while others see rubble. Spatial choreography is clean: sandaled foot → bend → knee → center stone; crowd remains at respectful periphery. Weather (cold wind) contrasts the “warmth” he generates, charging the final image; environment actively mirrors internal state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: can one man rekindle civic identity after annihilation? Escalation = each mosaic touch tightens memory pressure until renaming becomes the only live option. Agency = Elias’s fingers decide where the tessera belongs; no off-stage rescue. Cost = the emotional nakedness of declaring the old name while standing in ash—visible on page when crowd silence shifts to acknowledgment. Coincidence absent; tension is internal-to-external ripple only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mercy as insurgent act: in a scorched world, tenderness is the true radicalism. No final-paragraph sermon; the last line “warmth persists” is spoken by image, not thesis. Subtext operates in silence of crowd and mosaic brightness—readers supply the civic resurrection. Aberrant mercy is complicated: it leaves Elias exposed, not victorious, resisting tidy moral uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Elias’s perceptual orbit: “retrocognitively trapped,” “warm coldness” are his idiom, not narrator editorial. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for memory flood, short clause for the spoken name—mirroring inhalation/exhalation of ritual. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a healer-seer lexicon (tessera, enameled, Samarkhand). Final image of “cathedral ceiling open to stars” is perceptual metaphor, not overwriting. Voice coherence sustains under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence does setting-anchor + character-status + stakes (“gentle radical… sought to rebuild what others had destroyed”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, memory, or motion. Figurative language is sparse and tied to mosaic logic—“fractured heavens” mirrors tile cracks, physical logic unbroken. Read-aloud rhythm passes: three-beat cadence at closure (“We are what rises from the ashes”) lands without synthetic drum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-catastrophe mosaic-as-liturgy, mercy as steel. Premise is familiar (healer in ruins) but inflected through Islamic-art artifact and retrocognitive grief ritual. Transformation test fails if tessera replaced with random trinket—specific tile geometry and minaret origin are required. Risk taken: no antagonist except collective despair; stakes stay interior yet civic. Derivative guardrail avoided because lived detail (enameled blue-gold, name “Samarkhand”) is non-generic.</comment>
