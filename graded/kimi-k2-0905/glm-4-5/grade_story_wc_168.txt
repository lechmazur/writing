<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hard-soft embodiment is live in fingertips, breath, boot-crunch; interior contradiction (“he needed to enlighten not others, but himself”) drives every step. Micro-choice—lifting the box to moonlight—crystallizes hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flaw: no second character, so status crucible unused; reflection block >20% but anchored and tilt present stance. Closure renunciation earned by prior causality: the fracture accepted as deliberate stroke.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held: crack→ash→moonlit vein pattern intensifies until the fracture is re-read as survival stroke. Closure = Charged Poise: final image reweights premise—box no longer accusation but companion—cost is felt in “grounding, human connection.” Orientation anchored by word 40 (“moonlit ridge path”). No causal break; persistent constraint (scarred body + cracked box) shapes entire ascent/descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body-as-setting and cracked box-as-micro-setting constrain every choice; moonlight silvering the fracture is final image charge. Sensory triage fits crisis-aftermath: narrowed to footfall, porcelain cool, star wheel. Spatial choreography clean: ridge apex → world falls away → descent. Selector word “velvet darkness” risks soft cliché but immediately re-specified by “pricked by distant lights.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate private grief into shareable language—tightens once at apex when fracture is re-seen as universal mark. Escalation is textural: each return to crack deepens its meaning rather than widening options. Cost legible in “granite-hard grief” softened to “quiet beauty”; price paid is surrender of need for answers. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under accretive lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from porcelain survival trope transmuted into endurance signature; no moralizing sentence. Subtext in silence: towns “sleeping innocently unaware” vs. his insomnia. Final re-pricing: fracture = beauty stroke, not damage. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in cosmic indifference that still “watched his descent.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature in firefighter’s sensory triage (cool porcelain = temp gauge, star wheel = clock). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for star wheel, fragment “He closed them” for breath pause. No dialogue, so voice purity untouched. Register stable; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: “cracked porcelain box, cool and heavy… pressed like a silent accusation” does three jobs in one line. Metaphor chain (porcelain vein / burnt paper / granite grief) stays coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “slow dance of celestial bodies” appears twice but second use reweights meaning, so waived. Final line cadence mirrors star wheel, earns musical close.</comment>

<comment>Familiar trauma-aftermath frame refreshed by porcelain witness conceit and hard-soft tonal alloy. Risk taken: 715-word lyric accumulative structure with no external antagonist; coherence maintained. Synthesis feels inevitable: fracture must become beauty stroke. Slight deduction for “velvet darkness” star-catalogue phrasing—echoes standard nature-writing idiom.</comment>
