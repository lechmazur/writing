<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Galen’s interiority is evocative—“shivering bliss,” “unspoken knowledge”—but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final stance is foreshadowed, yet the cost is asserted (“something within Galen had changed”) rather than embodied. Micro-choices are missing at the moment of unsnapping; we are told he “surrendered” but not what he forfeits on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final Charged Poise reconfigures meaning. Closure lands—“guardian of the spaces between realities”—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clean by word 60; one shard only, no transition needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered through motion—phosphorescent vines, crystalline fruit that chimes—so setting constrains the unsnapping gesture itself. Spatial choreography remains coherent as Galen stands rooted while realities overlap. The final image of “impossible fruits now seemed less foreign” recharges the initial description, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when the allegiance ritual risks dissolving identity. Escalation is textural: density of sensory and metaphysical detail increases until the unsnap forces stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he forecloses ordinary knighthood for an uncharted guardianship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge pursued in isolation mutates into custodianship of the liminal. The marionette program’s “patterns of movement” echo the unsnapping of fixed identity, reweighted in the final image. No moralizing—resonance is left crystallized, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; rhythmic variation mirrors the accelerating overlap of realities (“time seemed to both stand still and rush forward”). Lexicon stays within Galen’s medieval-alchemical idiom; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“he sensed,” “he understood”) anchoring interiority without diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from longer, liquid openings to clipped fragments at the unsnap moment, propelling the beat. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “sound like a lock releasing” is precise. One paraphrase loop detected (“impossible colors…colors speaking a language”) but it is two beats apart and does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard plus marionette metaphysics feels fresh; the “abandoned theater program” re-casts puppetry as ontological engineering. Risk is taken in the accumulative rather than causal structure, yet coherence holds. Final guardianship of interstitial space is an inevitable-yet-surprising reconfiguration of withdrawn-knight trope.</comment>
