<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The guard’s motivation—cultivating sparks—remains abstract; no concrete contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized. His “dreamless” trait is asserted but never tested by a moment where a dream almost intrudes, so the promised interior tension stays off-stage. The Archivist’s sudden appearance supplies status pressure, yet the guard’s micro-choice in response is summary, not shown. Closure hinges on a single tick of the chess clock, a symbolic pivot that the guard’s prior agency does not visibly earn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric repetitions (“glowing dune,” “fractured lullaby”) build cadence toward a Charged Poise at the final seed. Orientation is complete by line four; the world’s ash/quantum logic is taught through image, satisfying the waiver. The clock’s tick supplies a perceptible before/after, but the cost is conceptual, not felt—no option is foreclosed on the page. Because the guard’s agency does not trigger the tick, causality is soft; the closure lands as resonance, not earned change.</comment>

<comment>The glowing dune functions as micro-setting: its luminescence guides the guard to the archive entrance and later mirrors the emergent seed, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is tight—visual radiance and pulsing light carry both wonder and utility. Spatial choreography is coherent across the train-to-sand transition, anchored by the handled chess clock. The ash-versus-bloom contrast is overt but justified by the closure’s reseeding image, giving the world a necessary mythic lift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserve sparks before void erasure—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete resource or timer limits choices. Pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally: repeated “fractured lullaby” and “unlit corners” deepen mood but do not narrow tactical options. The guard’s stance crystallizes when he admits “Perhaps I’ve begun” to dream, a micro-turn that costs him nothing visible. Escalation is thus textural, adequate for the accumulative lens, yet lacks a paid price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from image-constellation: ash vs. bloom, frozen vs. ticking time, dreamless vs. dreaming. The final seed sprouting beneath sand reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext resides in silence—no explicit statement of “hope” ever appears. The lullaby metaphor risks echoing prompt language, but its recurrence modulates from mournful to tentative, averting thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled distance; compression like “dreamless eyes” and “soft luminescence” teaches the pattern early. Syntax varies from elongated cadence to fragment (“a miracle breaking the stasis”) that mirrors the clock’s tick. Diction stays within stylized myth-register, never jarring. The Archivist’s single line carries authoritative subtext, distinguishing her from the guard’s gentler interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is loop-free; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—“midnight faces mockingly identical” sustains the chess-clock conceit without mixed logic. Information density is high: one sentence often layers setting, character, and concept (“Through wave functions, he could charm…”). Only minor scaffolding—the repeated “fractured lullaby” could be trimmed once—but it serves accumulative design, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The quantum-archive-desert synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; post-apocalyptic trope is re-inflected by wave-function mechanics and seed-light rebirth. Risky lyric repetition pays off in the final seed image that recharges every prior “bloom.” No close echoes of famous scenes; the frozen chess clock at midnight is a novel temporal talisman. Conceptual integrity holds: the world commits to its broken physics without last-minute rule patches.</comment>
