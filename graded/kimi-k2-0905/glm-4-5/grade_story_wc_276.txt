<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fisher’s cool-headed patience is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—each zig, each silent utterance—so his interiority stays concrete. The rail spike as tactile anchor, the net of transliterated feelings, and the final earned smile all show a hierarchy of values (understanding > glory) with visible cost. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, however; the arc is steady rather than torn, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s returned rhythms are now “subtly enriched,” an undeniable reweighting that costs the fisher future self-ignorance. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density rises via repeating zig-zags and silence-pockets until the goddess-echo is caught, then cadence relaxes, proving the pattern. Cost is legible in the softened, alive rail spike and in the trace that will permanently bend the constellations’ paths.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but tactical terrain: sound-blooms force the fisher to voice silence, to zig-zag, to weave longing-lonely-hope into net-fiber. Spatial choreography is meticulous—spike grounds, ripples spread, constellations drift—so every move is legible. The rail spike re-enters twice, its final transformed state charging the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>One dominant stake—catch the echo—tightens when each silence-pocket narrows usable space and the sleepwalkers’ unease raises risk of cosmic backlash. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: every zig, every voiced silence enlarges the net until the final lunge. Cost is visible in the spike’s trembling hum and the constellations’ forever-altered memory, but the price feels light, not gut-level, holding this just below the 8.8+ tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: fishing as the human wish to touch the unknowable, crystallized when the echo is released into garden and sky. No moral is stated; the final image of “profound spaces between sounds” reweights the whole pattern. The concept of transliterating emotion into net-fiber gives the metaphor concrete mechanics, avoiding abstraction, though the insight is gentle rather than shattering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the fisher’s perceptual filter: he “feels” the spike’s weight, “reads” ripples as longing. Syntax stretches into long breathy clauses that mimic rippling sound, then contracts at the catch—“he zigzagged one final time”—to mirror tension/release. No dialogue appears; the voice remains singular, rhythmic, and taught, fully paid off in the resonant final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but deliberate: each sentence layers sense, stakes, or image. Figurative chains (“whisper bloomed into visible ripples,” “divine electricity”) stay coherent within the garden’s physics. A faint template cadence (“He worked by…,” “With each…”) surfaces mid-text; it does not touch closure and is pattern-taught, so the slip is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sleepwalking-constellation + emotion-net synthesis feels inevitable yet novel; no prior story combines these exact mechanics. Risk is taken: lyric accumulation instead of causal reversals, but coherence is never sacrificed. The “feral lullaby” tone fuses wildness and calm into a fresh emotional register, pushing this near the top band.</comment>
