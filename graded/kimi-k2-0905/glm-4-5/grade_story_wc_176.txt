<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven quest is vivid and embodied in cold-cheek tears, but the interior contradiction—why a master caster needs a card template to braid—never surfaces. The “technically gentle” trait is asserted, not dramatized; the rope yields without resistance, so we see no genuine struggle or flaw in action. The renunciation (she stays as keeper) is legible and cost-bearing, yet the causal path to that choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled-with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: names crystallize overhead, the aurora column locks her in keeper stance, and the price—perpetual solitude—glows in the ice. Causality is intact but thin; the card-to-rope translation works because the text declares it does, not because prior beats foreshadow the mechanism. Orientation anchors early and hold; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density intensifies until the final image reweights memory itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ice sanctum is rendered through breath-clouds, lantern shadows, and the rope’s internal glow; every sense item is filtered through Elara’s caster-eye for pattern. Space is coherent: stairway → walls → basin → rope, each distance tracked without drift. The cold actively narrows her dexterity, making “technically gentle” a tactile constraint that charges the climax. Environment and tool (rope + card) jointly constrain the final reconfiguration—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve names or lose them forever—are signaled in paragraph one and tighten when the rope’s threads resist no fault; the only escalation is the aurora’s descent, which feels external more than earned. Agency is present but frictionless: each braid adjustment succeeds on first try, so no tactic is altered by visible cost. The climax reweights meaning (names made visible) yet the protagonist’s risk never redoubles; pressure plateau is graceful but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is a braid that must be retied by the living, not a moral about forgiveness. The organ card’s tiny punch-holes carry ancestral voice—an image that reprices memorization as tactile craft rather than abstract duty. No character declaims the theme; the final tableau of light-etched names in ice offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers: will future names still fade?—a plausible counter-reading that complicates preservation triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual signature—wax-caster diction of “pattern,” “holes,” “melt,” “threads”—and modulates rhythm from hush to shimmer as aurora descends. No dialogue, so voice coherence hinges on internal melody; the repetition of “snowmelt ardor” becomes incantatory without drum-beat monotony. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors (aurora as living column) stay consistent with ice-light logic. A hairline slip—“ancient chill” edges toward cliché—doesn’t touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between short breath-cloud bursts and longer braided clauses that mimic rope structure; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Information density is high—each sentence layers cold, light, and pattern without padding. One mixed metaphor: “time stretching around her like the rope” momentarily conflates duration and cord, but clarity recovers. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, satisfying the ear-test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lost-wax-caster + organ-card + ceremonial-rope triad feels fresh, grounding memory-transcription in pre-digital tactile crafts. Aurora-as-server is a risk that pays off visually, avoiding sci-fi gadgetry. The pilgrimage structure is familiar, but the specificity of punch-holes mapping onto braid offsets derivation. A near-echo of “names written in light” skirts prior fantasy tropes yet retains enough sensory novelty to escape full deduction.</comment>
