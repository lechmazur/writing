<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prophet’s precognitively forgetful gift is more label than lived contradiction; only late does “he clung to the echoes” show a micro-choice. The caretaker’s single-scene entry supplies external pressure, but her exit is fiat, not crucible. The final smile-plus-turn feels tidy; the cost of losing the sound again is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chalked spiral completes, the arch hums, and the prophet accepts imminent forgetting—conceptual cost is legible. Causal chain is slender (caretaker’s grandmother tape) yet coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern of driftwood→memory→sound tightens once and holds. Orientation beats the 120-word mark cleanly; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog-sculpture garden is more than postcard: condensation on the arch catalyzes the chalk drawing that unlocks sound. Driftwood, chalk, and metal arch function as micro-setting—each handled, re-positioned, and re-weighted. Sensory selection stays narrow to prophet’s haptic/auditory bias; no static white-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound of growing older”—is early and legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when chalk-on-arch triggers layered sighs, foreclosing the option to keep the memory; cost is the impending forget. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals; sufficient for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from echo/driftwood/chalk returns: the only way to “keep” time is to relinquish its record. Subtext lives in chalk spiral vs. tape spiral—analog versus ephemeral. Final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing; resonance lingers in tidal fade-out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at lyric distance; diction (“tidal longing,” “precognitively forgetful”) is poetic yet internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during chalk-drawing beat, mirroring rising hum. Caretaker dialogue differs slightly—direct practical tone—sufficient for brief appearance. No head-hopping; perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is supple, high-density; most sentences do double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional soft repeats—“arranging driftwood as directional markers” formula appears thrice; minor loop. Mixed-metaphor risk in “ships in a misty harbor” but clears. No artifact touches closure beat; momentum breathes well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: junkyard prophet who forgets the future searches for an audible aging-process. Driftwood-as-arrow-path plus chalk-on-metal-as-tape-head is inventive micro-imaging. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant fade-out. Not 9+ because premise alone carries most lift—characters remain archetypal.</comment>
