<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s longing for his lost sister is concrete from the first paragraph; the whispered vial test is a visible micro-choice that risks Captain Morgan’s scorn. His embodied reaction—tears of “screaming tenderness”—pays off the internal contradiction between gentleness and intensity. The sister’s off-stage moment of recognition is too summarized to let us feel her cost, but his cost is palpable. Motivation stays consistent and the vial cork becomes a charged talisman, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal lattice is tight: vial cork → whisper → jasmine scent → returned vibration → captain’s softened stance. Each beat is a because/therefore link; no off-stage coincidences resolve the stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the captain’s “sea listens best to those who speak softly” re-weights the story’s rule-set with social cost. Only minor waiver: the sister’s village beat is a shard, but transition is telegraphed by “halfway around the world” and the lens stays lyric-causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is never a postcard: its western wall neglects a garden whose single night-blooming jasmine constrains Elias’s method and perfumes the whisper. Glass, cork, and flower are tactile tools whose states change (uncorking, plucking, warming) and directly enable the climax. The scent’s impossible arrival overseas recharges the setting as micro-setting. One minor slip—no sensory narrowing under stress—but the environment is inseparable from the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens when the cork warms in hand, foreclosing the captain’s shouted method. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the whisper departs, returns as vibration, and reconfigures the old keeper’s worldview. Cost is visible: Elias’s tear-tracked face and the captain’s concession. No reversals are needed; the lyric causal design only requires one meaningful tightening, which arrives on schedule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the whispered vibration trope without moralizing: communication is purified by vulnerability, not volume. The jasmine scent’s reappearance overseas reweights the premise non-literally. No character states the thesis; the captain’s final line distills it through subtext. Ambiguity lingers—did the sister truly remember?—but that uncertainty is thematic, not fuzzy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: maritime texts, cork hum, “peach and lavender” dawn. Syntax tightens under pressure—“with all the tenderness he could muster, yet with the intensity of a scream inside his heart”—mirroring the paradox. Captain’s diction shifts to softer sea idiom at the end, marking status change. No head-hopping; the sister’s moment is externalized, but the lens re-centers on Elias immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long sentence for dawn calm, then clipped clauses at the whisper release. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“protective aura” is the only near-purple line, but it is brief and character-true. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Tense stable, pronouns clean, final line cadence echoes opening lighthouse image, giving circular ear-satisfaction.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “whisper > shout” maritime experiment feels fresh against lighthouse lore; the cork-as-filter is a specific, non-generic talisman. Jasmine scent as transoceanic carrier transforms a familiar lost-sibling trope into sensory magic that follows its own logic. Risk is taken: quiet climax instead of rescue spectacle, but it pays off under the lyric lens. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight—every detail re-illuminates when the vibration returns.</comment>
