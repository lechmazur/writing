<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“trying to bury the loss beneath new layers of identity”). The decisive shift to “Elara of the Flight Paths” is signaled rather than dramatized in-scene; we watch her write the letter but never see the internal contradiction collide with an external test that forces the signature. Motivation is legible, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not embodied, in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bird’s release crystallizes her reclaimed identity with a felt opportunity cost—she is now publicly the trainer again, city anonymity forfeited. Causal chain is thin: the meteorite’s “paper trails” never actively constrain tactics, so the turn relies on symbolic affirmation rather than a because/therefore pivot. Orientation is swift; single-scene default met. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; pattern of dust–paper–flight accumulates to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Attic is economically anchored—skylight beam, dust column, parchment stacks—and filters through Elara’s pigeon-trained attention to air currents. Micro-setting (meteorite as paperweight) functions as tool-as-setting, guiding her mapping ritual; however, the space never actively resists or endangers her, so constraint is mild. Sensory selection favors paper, ink, and feather imagery; other senses under-used. Strong specificity, but environment remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the lost songs via pigeon post—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only narratively (“each day…clearer”) rather than through an on-page obstacle that raises cost or narrows options; no external opposition or resource limit appears. The sole tightening is her decision to sign the letter, but the price (public exposure, winter risk) is projected, not dramatized. Closure is earned by stance crystallization, yet the beat lacks a visible trade-off within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation through analogue connection emerges via dust-mote mapping and paper trails, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext operates in the meteorite’s alien warmth versus earthly flight, but the opposition isn’t leveraged for irony. Final image of bird vanishing into “ancient blue” offers a quiet conceptual repricing: cosmic fragment now bound to terrestrial messenger. Ambiguity is present yet modest; complexity doesn’t deepen past personal renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—attention to air, texture of ink, weight of meteorite—maintaining coherent psychic distance. Syntax lengthens during reflective passages, then compresses at release, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator overlay rather than character cognition, but slips are minor and late.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates well; sentence variety supports the accrual of pattern. Figurative layering is dense—multiple paper/trail metaphors—but consistent and taught early, so density penalty waived. No loops or scaffold detected. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle contains two near-paraphrase moments (“patterns that spoke of journeys…”, “guidance system that led her back”) that dull momentum slightly. Clean mechanics; pronouns stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Mars relic with pre-digital courier craft feels fresh; meteorite-as-charm repurposes cosmic debris as talisman for earthly reconnection. Transformation is specific: the same chip that once “created curious paper trails” becomes ceremonial cargo, reweighting its function. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than spectacle—but coherence justifies the gamble. Could swap meteorite for another keepsake with minor edits, so irreplaceability is partial.</comment>
