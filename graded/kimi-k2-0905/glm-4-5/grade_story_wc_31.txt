<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hemingway's synesthetic gift is dramatized through concrete sensory cross-bleed and drives every beat; the “why me?” ache is embodied, not labeled. Interior contradiction is missing—he never fears or resists the gift—so the arc is discovery-only, not self-revision. Still, his final micro-choice to light the pier with polychrome flames costs him solitude and secrecy, earning a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous object (lanterns, key, books, flames) layers density until the final image reweights the stake. The lighthouse door appears without set-up, a mild teleport, but the library portal repays the cheat by making the water/non-water rule legible in action. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself becomes his vow, undeniable cost painted overhead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, pier, and Victorian lighthouse are sketched with selector’s economy; the sunken library is tactile—mahogany door, starlight robes, salt-woven pages—yet never stalls momentum. The key tag and oil lamp function as micro-settings that constrain hand and choice. Final polychrome lamppost flame recharges every prior glow, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do I hear color?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the librarian’s answer forecloses the option of ignorance. No visible price (health, relationship, job) is risked, so escalation is cognitive, not visceral; still, the vow to share the gift carries social cost that lands on the final sky. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: perception is obligation. The luminous vows literalize this—promises made visible—yet resist moralizing. Final image of public polychrome harbor sky offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights solitude into service, leaving counter-readings (artistic vocation, aging legacy) open and alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—sound-as-color metaphors are Hemingway-only and rhythmically controlled. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within an aging lamplighter’s lexicon. Final paragraph modulates to incantatory cadence that mirrors lantern drift without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphor density peaks in library symphony but pattern is taught early via lantern constellation, so payoff feels earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Clause rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored. One near-slip—“truth that hides behind truth itself” flirts with tautology but is saved by immediacy of librarian’s smile.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Synesthesia-as-portal fantasy is familiar, but fusion with maritime gothic and library-of-the-drowned gives fresh tilt. Lamplighter profession and festival lanterns are particularized, not generic. Risk taken: quiet ending replaces confrontation with sky-painting; coherence holds. Transformation test passes—gift and setting are inseparable from this voice.</comment>
