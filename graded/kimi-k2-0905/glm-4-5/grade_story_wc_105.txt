<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—designing perfect aids yet hunting betrayal—powers the arc, but the cancer label (“just weeks ago”) arrives as exposition, not embodied cost; the final renunciation is credibly earned yet softened by overt lyric summarizing rather than a concrete last gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the matrix-cooling “delicate shattering” crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing—betrayal sound becomes forgiveness resonance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, but the cancer stake is declared late and never visibly alters tactics, slightly thinning the felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Glass panes distorted by water pressure” and “phosphorescent jellyfish in shipwrecks” are tactile, POV-filtered details that constrain every move; the cooling crystalline matrix itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Central stake—capture trust-breaking sound—tightens once when silence-collecting yields the crystalline shard; the audible shift from betrayal to healing reweights meaning with undeniable pressure, satisfying the one meaningful deepening required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative sound harvest rather than assertion: beauty out of destruction is shown when the same matrix first screams betrayal then sings healing; the final harmonic avoids moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about whether warning others would spare or stunt them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—“reds into bass notes that made his teeth ache”—is vivid and consistent; lyric patterning (“while cells divided”) recurs like a taught refrain, paying off when cellular mortality harmonizes with orchard regrowth; no head-hopping, rhythm modulates under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry dual duty—sound, color, emotion—yet occasional modifier stacks (“battered marvel of existence”) flirt with purple; no paraphrase loops, but the phrase “while cells divided” is repeated four times, creating a faint template cadence that dulls the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing synesthetic sound-design with drowned shipwreck greenhouses feels fresh; the inversion—harvesting silence rather than sound—grows inevitably from Kael’s color-hearing gift, not gimmickry, fulfilling the transformation test.</comment>
