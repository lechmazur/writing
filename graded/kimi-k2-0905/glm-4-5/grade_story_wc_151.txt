<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile ritual with the clipboard, the chalk code, the letter’s weight—but her “transformation” is declared, not dramatized: the final smile never pays the cost of the soul-piece she claims to have surrendered. The scientist-client remains off-stage, so the crucible is only Elara vs. her own summary, flattening contradiction. The micro-choices (chalk, drop the letter) are atmospheric, not fork-in-the-road moments that foreclose a path. Result: competent portrait, yet the decisive internal shift feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden receptacle image re-weights identity and time, and the “eternal dance” line makes the conceptual cost legible. Causality, however, is soft: the letter’s noon deadline is named but never tightens visible tactics; the chalk code is more metaphor than plot lever. The reflective blocks (≈30 %) exceed the default cap yet function under the BRR exception, but their lyric pattern is taught late, so the lens feels accumulative only by midpoint. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The golden arcade and dawn light are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered; the clipboard’s dark wood and chalk dust supply tactile micro-setting that returns to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the crouch-rise-mail drop sequence. Weather (yesterday’s rain) is causally linked to faded code but stays background; no world-rule contradiction. The environment does not constrain a tactical choice—she could mail the letter anywhere—so the 9+ gate is missed; cap 8.8 waived because closure still uses the arcade’s glow as emotional repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding the client’s reinvention via slow mail—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external or internal force threatens failure, so pressure stays ambient. The noon deadline is nominal; it never forces a visible trade-off or narrows options. Escalation is lyrical (light shift = perspective shift) rather than causal under the Accumulative lens; acceptable at this length, but the absence of a tangible price keeps the score sub-7. Closure reweights meaning, yet the protagonist’s agency is contemplative, not a decision that visibly forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of identity fluidity vs. surveillance emerges through tactile ritual (paper, chalk, pseudonyms) rather than exposition; the final image of the golden receptacle non-literally answers “what is lost when everything is trackable?” No moralizing summary. Recurring motifs (clipboard, chalk, dawn light) accrue thematic weight by reprise at the end, satisfying the 9+ resonance test. The concept of “margins as sanctuary” stays implicit, avoiding thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in Elara’s synesthetic attention to texture and light. Syntax modulates between languid dawn cadence and brief imperative bursts (“She crouched…”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness across characters is N/A. Filter verbs appear but feel motivated by meditative tempo; no head-hopping. Lyric compression is taught by the third paragraph and paid off in the closing sentence; closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but three successive “She…then she…” templates in paragraph 4 create a mild cadence loop (−0.3). Figurative language is dense in the final paragraph (“bridge between two souls,” “eternal dance”); because pattern was not established early, it edges toward overwriting (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure. Information density is high; most sentences fold setting + interiority. Minor scaffolding: “something almost sacred” hedges where concrete sensation would suffice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing analog-era surface mail with futuristic pseudonym-for-hire is a fresh angle; the chalk-code sidewalk network feels specific and new. The golden arcade functions as both literal setting and metaphor for transparency vs. reinvention. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure itself, which is handled competently. No close echoes of famous scenes. Slight deduction for the ubiquitous “dawn light epiphany” trope, but the mail/chalk combo rescues distinction.</comment>
