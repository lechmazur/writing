<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bellhop’s contradictory impulses—his yearning for music versus his acceptance of silence—are dramatized in the bolt-tracing beat and climaxing in his sung note; the cost of rupturing the fortress’s protection is felt in the sudden warmth of stone against still-numb fingers. Interiority stays concrete via tactile detail rather than label-speak. The decision to sing is credibly earned because the bolt’s etchings prove the fortress preys on musicians, making endurance more costly than revolt. Flaw: the “choir jacket” is mentioned once as back-story costume; it never constrains action or returns, so profession lacks micro-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of etched bolt → recognition of predatory pattern → decision to reverse ritual → sung note that awakens walls. Orientation anchors by line 3 (who/where/when). Closure is a Decisive Change: music re-enters the world; the cost—safety forfeited—is legible in the humming blue stone. The single tightening works, but the bolt’s first appearance is late (~65%), slightly delaying escalation; still, it pays off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, leaded glass, snow-glitter, and the spiral staircase are selectively filtered through the bellhop’s tactile attention; the bolt, a micro-setting object, literally charges the ending as it warms in his palm. Spatial choreography is crisp: descending → crouch → pry → trace melody. Snow shifts from oppressive to rhythmic, mirroring internal change. Fortress rules (silence = shield) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. safety—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: discovery that the fortress feeds on musicians converts silence from refuge to predation, forcing the sing/remain choice. The sung note visibly pays the price (walls shimmer, protection jeopardized). Agency is decision, not physical combat; that fits length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: sanctuary purchased by self-censorship is morally untenable. The “unpardonable silence” motif accrues weight as the bellhop realizes it is not divine but predatory. Final image—snowfall dancing to his fragile note—reweights earlier snow as complicit, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains a hushed, ecclesiastical cadence that mirrors choir memory. Syntax lengthens then fractures during discovery (“names, dates, fragments…”) mimicking neural misfire. Perceptual signature is tactile-sonic: numb fingers, phantom tingles, remembered chords. No dialogue, so voice purity intact; register never drifts above bellhop’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphor count spikes only in the payoff beat where it is earned (“frostbitten hope”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Strong verbs (pressed, traced, ruptured) propel. Minor scaffolding: “they said” attribution for fortress lore could be trimmed, but it occupies one line and does not recur.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing a snow-bound sanctuary that weaponizes silence with a nerve-damaged ex-choir singer feels inevitable yet fresh; reversal of silence into predation rather than virtue is the non-obvious turn. Detail is specific (leaded glass, piano bench bolt) rather than generic gothic. Risk—singing could collapse protection—is taken fully, not hedged.</comment>
