<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s calm is stated repeatedly but never contradicted internally; no embodied friction or micro-choice shows why this trait matters under mortal pressure. His final act is foregone, not wrestled with, so the “earned” closure feels administered rather than lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle CR image, but the causal chain is outline-narrative: “he followed the diary, therefore bridge restored.” Missing intermediate obstacles or resource costs keep the remodel from tightening options along the way.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Copper wire singing against wood and breathing stone pillars supply tactile specificity; the setting guides the choreography of wire-wrapping and is recharged in the final glow, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the circuit before death—is declared early, but pressure stays flat; no shortage of wire, weather, or physical setback alters tactics. The six-month clock is acknowledged yet never compresses choices on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies communion emerges through the orchard’s visible response rather than sermon, but the diary’s prior disappearance and Elias’s illness aren’t woven back in, leaving thematic loose ends.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays stable; rhythmic repetition (“copper wire wrapped…”) creates mantra texture fitting the ritual. Occasional elevated diction (“symphony of light and growth”) drifts above Elias’s grounded caretaker idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong forward pull for half the piece, then recycled phrases (“living stone pillars,” “architectural secrets”) loop without new pressure. Density drops into summary during months 4-5, dulling the pre-climax escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Merging megalithic architecture with arboreal sentience feels fresh; the copper-constellation technique particularizes it. Still, the “six-month deadline awakens ancient site” contour is familiar, capping ingenuity short of the 8+ band.</comment>
