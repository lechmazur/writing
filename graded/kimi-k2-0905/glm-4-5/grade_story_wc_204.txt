<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eldon’s obsession is vividly anchored in bodily memory (ink-stained fingers) and loss, but the interior contradiction—preserve vs destroy—stays summary. The final “both preserved and destroyed” is declared, not dramatized with a visible renunciation gesture; cost is felt but not embodied in a micro-choice we can see.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library becomes breathable, knowledge unbound, Eldon coated in dew-words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight the stake. The cost is legible in the cracking/reforming glass and the erasure of his old sanctuary; orientation is taught early via the floating glass orchard, no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard, cloud sea, frost-branches, and the letterpress itself are all tactile, specific, and filter through Eldon’s professional eye. Micro-setting triumph: the press’s shifting symbols and the dew-words on skin literally charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs release knowledge—tightens when the whisper destabilizes the perfect system. One meaningful deepening: the library’s warping glass forecloses the option of static eternity. Cost is visible in the cracking branches; agency is accumulative (preparation across seven days) rather than a single causal turn, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory and knowledge must stay alive, not embalmed. The final breathable library reweights the frost-patterns and bottled whisper without moralizing. Subtext in the silent rustling and dew-words carries the emotional aftereffect; no thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice remains stable, with perceptual signature tied to Eldon’s typographer eye (symbols, ink, frost-glyphs). Rhythmic control heightens under pressure—“branch by branch… translucent reformed”—without obscuring clarity. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; elision of time (“seven days”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>High density, natural rhythm, no loops. Figurative language is selective: “golden leaves in an autumn storm” is single, apt, and tied to orchard imagery. Minor register lift—“negotiable firmament”—but consistent with the elevated concept. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: floating glass orchard + letterpress + bottled first-word is memorable and inevitable in hindsight. Risky concept-driven piece commits fully; no retreat to safe realism. The breathable library feels like a genuine reimagining of Alexandria/Timbuktu crystallized, not checklist ornament.</comment>
