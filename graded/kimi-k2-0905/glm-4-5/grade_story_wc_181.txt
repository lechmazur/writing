<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias’s curator identity is vivid, but interiority cycles ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet") without new contradictory impulse; micro-choice shifts from restraint to pursuit are present yet feel declared rather than embodied, so the cost of crossing the temporal threshold lands as concept more than felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: Elias’s stance crystallizes with conceptual cost signaled by orchard flare and the universe "laughing and weeping"; however, the nonlinear-inheritance rule stays abstract—no concrete constraint rebounds on tactics—so the lens leans Accumulative/Textural more than Causal, slightly thinning the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gravity-defying orchard, resonance field, bathroom acoustics—each setting micro-zone is filtered through Elias’s astronomer-curator bias and ultimately charges the final epiphany; spatial choreography stays clean, and the luminous orchard reweights the closing lens, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes—access to forbidden knowledge vs. sanity—surface early and tighten once the resonance monitors spike, but escalation is textural (pattern intensification) rather than causal; the price is cosmic-abstract ("weight of collapsing stars") not tactics-bound, so pressure is felt but never narrows options on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of temporal hubris emerges implicitly through orchard luminosity and cameo heartbeat rather than exposition; final image reconfigures earlier petals-as-pages without moralizing, inviting reader re-calculation, though thematic echo in "simply complicated" leans close to thesis-label and caps the score short of 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person lyric stays stable in perceptual distance; diction ("starlight drifted," "phosphorescence casting") remains curator-astronomer specific, and bathroom-breakthrough motif is seeded early, paying off as legitimate pattern. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice carries subtextual tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally varied sentence rhythm and selective detail, yet sporadic paraphrase loops ("brightened disquiet" twice, "simple yet complicated" variants) and stacked cosmic metaphors in the climax dull immediacy; clarity holds but the density flirtation keeps the prose from full propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pistachio-shell cameo-as-time-key feels genuinely new; orbital archive orchard provides off-beat cosmic pastoral; risk resides in high-concept compression rather than twist. Specific astronomy-curator lens freshens familiar "forbidden knowledge" arc, making the synthesis particular and memorable within tight word count.</comment>
