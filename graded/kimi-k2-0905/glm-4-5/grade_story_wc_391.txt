<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mapper’s patient-revolution motive is coherent and embodied in meticulous moon-tracking, but interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized (“sculpting patience from impatience” repeated). No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are present yet feel pre-planned, reducing felt cost at the close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn thaw crystallizes the mapper’s Earned Stasis—continued quiet labor with visible cost of lifelong solitude. Accumulative/textural lens holds: moon-path density and viaduct hum tighten the stake toward a Charged Poise. Causality is soft (no opposing force), but pattern is taught early and payoff is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake, basalt corridors, and magnetic viaduct are vividly filtered through the mapper’s star-honed perception; each constrains action (lake as mirror, basalt as resonator). Spatial choreography is clean; weather and stone actively participate in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore communal patience—stays coherent; pressure deepens via moon-path accumulation and viaduct hum, but lacks external opposition. Tightening is present yet internal; cost is felt mainly as future loneliness, not an immediate on-page trade-off. Sufficient for short-form but not razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through celestial rhythms versus human haste; final dawn-thaw image reweights prior moon data without moralizing. Subtle refrains (unyoke, sculpt patience) accrue resonance; no thematic echo penalty applies because thesis is never named in prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to mapper’s perceptions; diction (“restrained wildness,” “polished obsidian mirror”) is poetic yet consistent with a horizon mapper’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to shorter pulses at viaduct hum, showing pressure control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><paragraph>Prose is dense and mostly loop-free; occasional modifier stacks (“polished obsidian mirror,” “softly purposeful”) flirt with overwritten cadence but stay within pattern. Figurative logic is consistent; no mixed metaphors. A few scaffold phrases (“the mapper knew…”) are minor but do not touch closure.</paragraph>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moon-path patience campaign and magnetized viaduct create a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking lies in quiet accumulative structure rather than explosive plot, and coherence is maintained. Specific volcanic basalt lore and compass anomaly details ground the concept.</comment>
