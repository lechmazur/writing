<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s cold-data persona is vivid, but Thomas remains a cipher; the empathy-borrow never costs her anything on the page, so the “earned” clause fails. Interiority is sharp (“counted the event as precisely as she counted heartbeats”) yet the climactic choice—send him away—repeats the beat she always performs, so no new value hierarchy is revealed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanishing-star tally reframes her cruelty as cosmic routine, cost legible in “another boundary breached.” Causal chain holds—letter → visit → transfer → dismissal—but the story withholds Thomas’s stakes until late, so the Orientation Test nudges down.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The topaz walls and halo fragment are tactile, refract light onto ceiling planes, and constrain her optics bench; spatial choreography stays clean as Thomas crosses the room. Sensory economy is good—starlight, lead dust, press clank—but the exterior city/era remains blank, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“new emotional matrix”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when she activates the transfer, narrowing Thomas’s agency to zero. Price is visible in his disorientation, but because Elara risks nothing concrete (no backlash, no fragment flicker), the escalation tops at high-7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: quantifying feeling erases the feeler. Subtext lives in the star-count that keeps ticking after harm is done; no moral is preached. Final image reweights prior motifs—stars, equations, vanishing—into a cold cosmic shrug.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—geometric moonlight, heartbeat arithmetic—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors her mind: long cumulative clauses for calculation, abrupt imperatives for dismissal. No dialogue contamination; Thomas’s borrowed cadence is intentionally flattened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies well; sentences open with participial light-play then snap to verb-driven commands. Minor loop: “another star vanished… One more star vanished” repeats within 60 words; not fatal but keeps it sub-9. Metaphors stay coherent (light = data) and propel rather than stall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Concept of empathy-as-data-extraction feels fresh; the star-disappearance clock externalizes moral erasure in a way I haven’t seen. Risk is taken with the cold protagonist, yet the piece commits fully, avoiding safety-middle. Could push further if the fragment exacted an unforeseen price.</comment>
