<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lena’s insomnia-as-identity is embodied in trembling hands and pigment choices; the amber brooch becomes an externalized organ of memory, forcing a micro-choice (exchange) that costs her talismanic comfort and earns the new palette. Interior contradiction is present—clutching warmth while courting exchange—and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the brooch’s solace for public testimony. Voice keeps painterly perceptual signature (“restless oceans and fragmented memories”) without diagnostic self-talk. Slight dip: the old woman functions more as benefactor than crucible, so status pressure is muted; still, the protagonist’s flawed attachment and earned renunciation carry the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tide reveals path → brooch appears → exchange offers new pigments → insomnia ends because purpose replaces trauma. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the studio sentence “I paint what remains…” reweights the whole rule-set with social cost—she must now speak for the dead. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the brooch and the public role she accepts. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one transition (night→dawn) is clean. Minor slip: the woman’s sudden arrival is convenient, but it complicates rather than resolves, so causality survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal island is not backdrop but tactical partner: treacherous waters swallowed villages, so isolation pressures her art; rain trails literally guide her to the brooch and then to the exchange. Micro-setting objects—amber brooch, solar lamps, rare pigments—constrain choices (keep vs. trade, old palette vs. new). Weather is causal: storm scars create the trail map; cool morning air makes the brooch’s warmth uncanny, charging the final image when that warmth is relinquished. Spatial choreography is clean: half-buried find, palm-imprint warmth, canvas-wrapped exchange tracked without drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transform trauma into testimony—tightens when the brooch forces a trade: keep private solace or accept public responsibility. Protagonist agency drives the turn; luck only presents the offer, does not decide. Visible price: she gives up the amber warmth that let her sleep, accepting the insomnia of accountability. Escalation is modest but sufficient at this length; the tightening is the single meaningful choice that forecloses the old coping loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from convergence imagery—water/earth, past/present, beauty/war—without overt thesis. The final sentence reweights “remains” from residue to possibility, a non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. Subtext in gesture: handing over the brooch is also burial of her own preserved grief. No echo-chamber symbols; amber, pigments, and rain trails all recur with shifted meaning, earning resonance instead of decal application.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-close paints with painterly perceptual signature: color vocabulary, light temperature, pigment texture. Free indirect slips in cleanly: “her canvas filled with restless oceans…” filters narration through her eye. No head-hopping; the woman’s voice is exterior, idiomatic, distinct. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for insomnia fugue, shorter declaratives after exchange ratchets purpose. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) could be trimmed but do not stall pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often does setting-emotion-symbol work. A few mixed metaphors (“piece of unearthed convergence”) flirt with abstraction but are saved by tactile context. No scaffold loops; final-line reprise of “thresh meaning” is deliberate callback, not churn. Word-choice precise: “pigment” vs. “color,” “trembling” vs. “shaking.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: rain-trail cartography as trauma map + amber brooch as memory tarot + pre-war pigments as refugee archive. Post-war island setting is familiar substrate, but convergence via painterly craft rather than salvage quest feels non-template. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: insomnia cured not by object but by public vocation—avoids magic talisman cliché. Could edge higher if woman’s backstory were more particularized, but core angle remains distinctive.</comment>
