<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is concrete—her locket touch, the because/therefore link between her father-loss and Lila’s silence—but the “softly adaptive” trait is label-only until the drum moment, and her emotional layering flattens into therapeutic epiphany-speak at the eclipse. Lila’s first words feel slightly convenient; the drum choice is credible, but the causal bridge from muteness to speech could show more micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunlight returns and Lila whispers, reweighting silence→sound with felt cost (Maya’s tears). Causal chain holds: locket memory → drum offer → eclipse cue → speech; no teleporting props. Orientation is clean by ~100 words; one scene, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sage ridge and wind-borne scent anchor early and return in the final image, constraining the duo’s open-air session and supplying the aromatic hush that frames the drumbeat. The micro-setting of the locket against Maya’s skin acts as a charged object-setting hybrid. Sensory balance is purposeful; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break Lila’s silence—signaled in paragraph four; tightening occurs when the eclipse darkens and drumming becomes the only channel left. Maya’s agency drives the offering of the drum, but the external cosmic event does half the work, slightly diluting cost visibility. Still, a felt price is legible in Maya’s tear-blur, satisfying the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Ordinary magic” emerges via the eclipse-drum nexus rather than explicit thesis, culminating in the reweighted locket: infant curl now bound to Lila’s first words. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, but the phrase “ordinary magic” is used once in exposition, a minor echo. Resonance is concrete, not platitude.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is present in Maya’s musical metaphors and sage-scent bias. Rhythm modulates—longer lyrical sentences for hush, clipped fragments at totality. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse and natural; subtext carries the whispered payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, no template cadence. One paraphrase loop: “the world held its breath in anticipation” echoes “suspended moment” two sentences later (−0.2). Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. High information density; opening and closing lines are sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>The eclipse-as-therapy is a fresh synthesis; the baby-curl locketsage ridge triad particularizes a familiar trauma-recovery arc. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending—but stakes stay intimate, avoiding gimmick. Not radically new, yet the sensory triad and musical frame feel specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
