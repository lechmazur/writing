<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is strong—his slow cadence masks urgent need, RBG tremors externalize guilt—but the brother rupture is told not shown, so motivation leans on summary. Micro-choice is present (touching branch, whispering name) yet the cost feels pre-paid by lyric rather than dramatized beat. Still, the single-POV stance sustains a believable flawed man under ritual pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lace reading → compass spin → brother’s name spoken → needle glows, each because/therefore legible. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the glowing needle reweights grief into “true direction” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The reflective blocks exceed 30% but are anchored to present stimuli and alter tactics, so BRR exception applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lace, compass glass, dew-bead branches) constrains every micro-gesture; dew prisms the final hue, charging the closure image. Salt-petrichor breeze and islet scale are sketched sparely yet supply ritual boundaries. Spatial choreography is clean: tutor→window→case→trees track without drift. Weather is causal—storm brought compass, dawn brings revelation—so environment shapes stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of apology—signals early and tightens once: when lace reveals new loops, the tutor must decide to voice the name, narrowing options from silent ritual to spoken confession. Cost is conceptual (cerulean regret transformed) rather than visceral; price is legible but not physically felt. Escalation is single yet meaningful under causal lens; no reversal, but diffusion of sorrow is earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of tide/compass/needle as memory vectors, not thesis statements; final image of glowing hue reweights grief without moralizing. Cerulean regret shifts to “true direction,” offering resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence—room empty, lace mute, trees witness. No final-paragraph sermon; wisdom is earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: slow, horticultural cadence with maritime salt; syntax lengthens then contracts with compass spins, mirroring breath. Perceptual signature is botanical—branches “greet dawn,” lace “contains chlorophyll of grief.” No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Diction stays within tutor’s plausible lexicon; “cerulean” is justified by coastal light obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from languid clauses to clipped whispers; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“tides of remembrance” taught as refrain—so payoff justifies lushness. No mixed metaphors; compass needle obeys internal logic. Information density strong: one sentence often layers weather, tool, and emotion. Minor scaffold: “slow-spoken” repeats 3× but serves mantra, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of bonsai discipline with ghost-ship compass is fresh; lace-as-code transforms domestic textile into nautical oracle. Risk is quiet—lyric ritual over plot—but coherence holds. Could swap islet for any shore, so specificity not absolute. Still, synthesis of arbor patience + maritime haunting feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
