<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia, methodical hope, and need to resurrect kindness through lost languages are credibly layered; her trembling fingers and whisper to jasmine embody the motive. Yet the piece never risks her flaw compounding—she paints exactly what she intends, so the ‘earned’ closure is more serene confirmation than costly renunciation. Still, interiority stays concrete, and the final smile feels proportionate to the quiet stasis achieved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed mural crystallizes her premise that kindness transcends eras, with conceptual cost—she forfeits sleep and anonymity. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each stroke adds density rather than tightens options, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights prior symbols. No orientation debt; greenhouse anchors by line 3. Lens holds; cost legible in dawn smog against saffron glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse glass, moon-tipped brush, and saffron light constrain every logistical choice—ink consistency, canvas size, timing of strokes. Smog-versus-oxygen tension externalizes her internal deficit, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys an insomniac’s narrowed attention: scent of jasmine, faint moonstone glow, rustle of journals. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no prop teleporting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes—prove kindness endures—are declared early but remain cerebral; pressure accumulates via lyric density rather than narrowing options. She faces no counter-force (doubt, sabotage, limited ink) that would force a trade-off; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Because the lens is Accumulative/Textural, this suffices for mid-band, but the lack of visible price or lost alternative caps intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete accumulation of glyphs, not lecture: kindness as humanity’s default language is re-stated only once, late, and is earned by the mural’s existence. Subtext operates in the silent glow of moonstone on vanished voices. The final image resists moralizing; it invites the reader to recognize themselves in lost kindnesses. Slight deduction for the whispered thesis to jasmine—closest the story comes to echo-chamber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to painter’s perceptual filter—synesthesia of scent, light, linguistic shapes. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for daydream flow, clipped fragments at “They sleep, waiting to be remembered.” No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Diction remains within artist/linguist lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Distinct signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; each sentence layers sensory, historical, emotional weight. Occasional elevated register (“testimony to her theory”) edges toward editorial, but fits the protagonist’s scholarly bent. Minor paraphrase echo: “saffron quiet” appears twice without new angle. Otherwise clean; metaphors coherent, no loops. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing insomnia, rooftop greenhouse, and lost-language resurrection yields fresh angle on familiar “art redeems” trope. Moon-tipped brush with inherited moonstone feels specific, not gimmick, because it governs timing of strokes. Still, the mural’s guaranteed success and absence of external resistance keeps the concept from full risk. Transformational enough to feel individual, but could push further into consequence.</comment>
