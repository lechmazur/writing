<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s centuries-long obsession is palpable in the trembling hand around the arrowhead and the barefoot tread across dust “bearing memories,” but the interior contradiction—why this immortal still trembles—goes unmined. Micro-choices (placing the seven stones, following the crows) are present yet feel predetermined rather than risky; the stance crystallizes without visible trade-off. The earned stasis is credible, but the cost is more cosmic than personal, blunting emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: resonance layers accrue through echo, pulse, and stone-skimming repetition until the final charged poise reweights “navigation without moving.” Orientation is secured by line 3; transitions are clean within one continuous canyon scene. Closure lands cleanly: the arrowhead’s new pulse is the Conceptual Repricing that makes Kael’s disappearance legible as completion, not death. The price—his erasure—could be sharper on the page, but the reconfiguration is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but instrument: bone towers refract light onto the arrowhead, dust transmits ancestral footfalls, the circular depression literally shapes the final placement. Micro-setting (arrowhead, stones, flock) constrains every tactical move; even Kael’s bare feet read as tactile antennae. Sensory economy is tight—sound and vibration dominate vision, matching the harmonic premise. The towers’ “whispering surfaces” reverb in the ending pulse, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the pulse be anchored—tightens once: the crows’ arrow formation shifts Kael from search to recognition. Agency is present (he places the stones, follows the birds), but escalation is more mystical than jeopardy-driven; options narrow cosmically, not viscerally. The felt price is Kael’s vanishing, yet it is rendered as transcendence rather than loss, muting cost clarity. Still, the accumulative pressure of echo-and-pulse reaches undeniable charged poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: navigation as internal resonance rather than external motion. Subtext resides in the crows’ silent directive and the arrowhead’s answering glow—no character articulates the thesis. The final image reweights centuries of skimming practice into a single anchored pulse, inviting reflection on stillness as journey. Avoids overt moralizing, though the cosmic scale dwarfs intimate human complexity.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet consistently legible; syntax lengthens and contracts with Kael’s breathless awe. Diction stays within a mystic hermit’s lexicon—“marrow,” “geometric perfection,” “sky-writings”—without academic drift. No dialogue to contaminate texture. Free-indirect pulses align with the harmonic motif; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Kael feels canyon dust as “memories” and reads bird wings as glyphs—never generic observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: only two mild paraphrase loops (“echoes…echoes,” “pulse…pulse”) and no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long anaphoric sentences for ritual beats, then fractured fragments when light erupts. Information density is high; each line layers time, vibration, or mythic reference. Artifacts stay clear of the closure beat, allowing 9-band proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</comment><comment>The harmonic stone-skimmer conceit is fresh, yet the immortal seeker guided by birds to a geologic lock is traceable to mythic archetype. Specificity of vibration-navigation and stone-casting mathematics transforms the template into something felt rather than borrowed. Risk lies in the cosmic dissolve ending, but it is earned by the accumulative resonance pattern. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight—practice rituals reframed as dimensional tuning.</comment>
