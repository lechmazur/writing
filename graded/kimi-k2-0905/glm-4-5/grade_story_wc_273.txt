<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (“serene anger that belied calm”) and embodied in action; childhood trauma motive is named but never dramatized, so the final epiphany feels generalized rather than paid for by prior micro-choices. The disappearance beat shows visible cost (gasping, glowing hair) yet the core flaw—why risking erasure answers the childhood question—remains asserted, not dramatized. Still, the POV’s sensory albinism and isolation read as lived, not label-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing (“We change our relationship to it”) that reframes the childhood question with undeniable cost (body dissolution, vitals spiking). Causal chain is tight: ink poured → consciousness sync → eclipse endpoint triggers dissolution → return with new knowledge. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity. The single shard design stays within 600-800 default; reflection is interleaved with present action and obeys BRR cap.</comment>

<comment>Wind-carved stone and hummingbird drone are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain tactics (drone perimeter scan, ink slab carved from same wind-sculpted rock). Sensory hierarchy favors immediacies: eclipse shadow, ink shimmer, vitals hologram. Micro-setting (stone slab as lab bench) functions as setting-object that enables the final experiment; environment physically guides the disappearance beat. No static postcarding; each detail either magnifies anomaly or supplies tool.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“why time slows in crisis”—is signaled early and tightened once: the disappearance attempt forces a live trade-off between knowledge and corporeal safety. Protagonist agency drives every beat: program drone, pour ink, step in, return, command log. Cost is legible on-page (body dissolution, vitals danger) and alters tactics (drone switches from passive watch to active aid). No coincidence; eclipse timing is external but functions as trigger, not resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: time’s malleability is shown via ink geometries that mirror perceptual stretch, not told. Final reconfiguration (“We change our relationship to it”) reweights all prior isolation and risk as existential stance rather than data hunt. Serene anger motif modulates into tremor of awe, giving emotional aftereffect. Resists tidy moral; leaves reader with paradox of clarity inside infinite stretch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: albino sensory bias (“see things others missed”), wind-whisper idiom, compressed scientific diction (“temporal displacement”) that stays inside POV lexicon. Rhythm breathes with action—short clauses during dissolution, longer cadence for reflection. No dialogue, so voice must carry texture; it does. Filter verbs used sparingly and only when voice-motivated (“they told the drone”). Tense stable; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, motive (“wind-carved encampment…research shelter…disappearing ink”). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is spare and coherent (“ink pooled in an intricate pattern”)—no mixed metaphors. Final line (“wind whispered…promise of new revelations”) supplies cadence without overwriting. Clean grammar; pronoun reference unambiguous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: albino perception + eclipse + disappearing ink as time portal feels novel yet inevitable. Risk of dissolution body-horror is risk actualized, not hedged. Tropes (lone genius, drone sidekick) are grounded in sensory specificity rather than checklist. Could swap desert for another remote locale, but ink-eclipse mechanics are inseparable from this exact setup. Concept commits fully; no late rule patches.</comment>
