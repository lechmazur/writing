<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena’s “persistently curious” tag is shown twice but never costs her anything; interiority stays vivid and embodied. Micro-choices (tuning the aid, moving to the garden) are tied to motive, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her path. Closure choice—calling security—reads as competence, not flaw-driven cost, so the arc flattens. Grandmother’s unseen vigilance supplies emotional charge, but Elena’s own transformation is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: pulse → garden → child → predator → intervention; closure lands with conceptual cost (grandmother’s warning finally heeded). Orientation clean by 120 words; transitions are soft ellipses rather than explicit, yet still track. Lens holds as Causal; one meaningful tightening suffices. Stakes declared early and finally materialize, satisfying the 600-800 word closure rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight fog are filtered through Elena’s ritual attention, constraining visibility and guiding her steps to the garden bench—setting actively shapes movement. Sound and temperature are left out, but selective visual haze mirrors the liminal premise without overwriting. Micro-setting (decades-old hearing aid) doubles as prop and emotional anchor, qualifying for 9+ object-as-setting test. Spatial choreography holds across archways → garden → bench.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the child—arrives late (after 60% mark), so earlier tension leans on mood rather than escalating risk. Pulse intensity supplies the only pressure rise; no resource or personal cost forecloses an option for Elena. Coincidence (grandmother’s photo happened to catch this predator) complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under lens. Closure supplies societal cost, yet protagonist’s sacrifice remains invisible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of post-mortem vigilance emerges through image pattern (photo → pulse →拦截), avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext thrives in the unheard warning finally enacted, but moral complexity is thin—no counter-readings complicate heroic reading. Final line reframes photo as “evidence of watchfulness,” a modest conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect feels gentle rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena; perceptual signature favors hushed, spectral diction (“ethereal fog,” “reeling hush”) consistent with twilight premise. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “reeling hush” to teach cadence. Dialogue brief and natural; child’s voice distinct enough for age. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly loop-free; occasional adjective stacks (“mist-clad atrium at twilight, dim blue light barely penetrates the ethereal fog”) approach overwriting but serve atmospheric density. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final line achieves charged image without scaffolding. Minor paraphrase in “emotional resonance to flow through her” could compress, but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obsolete hearing aid as paranormal forensic tool, grandmother’s snapshot as latent warning—specific, non-obvious, and organically integrated. Premise transforms familiar “I see dead people” trope into child-rescue thriller with elegiac tone. Risks quiet resolution rather than spectacle, coherent to lens. Could push further into moral ambiguity, but remains memorable within flash length.</comment>
