<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is sparse but concrete; the collector’s patience is shown through stillness and watching, not told. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the “philosophical” trait stays ornamental rather than tested. The final acceptance of the rope is credible because the prior stillness earns it, but the cost is more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain: patience → silence → fisherman's trust → rope gift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the knotted rope reconfigures the collector’s options without a physical act, and the cost is the lifetime of waiting that the fog-snow-dock image crystallizes. Lens stays situational throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow is not backdrop: the whitening planks muffle sound, forcing the collector into closer attention and coaxing the fisherman’s lowered voice. The fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice—only here can the knot language be read. Final image of fog parting re-weights the path forward, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is epistemic: gain the weavers’ knowledge. Pressure tightens once, when the fisherman moves from gruff refusal to active demonstration; the collector’s silence is the agency that forces the tightening. Cost is legible as the fisherman cuts the rope—irrevocable gift that forecloses his own transmission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-patience emerges from the collector’s stillness and the rope’s captured techniques; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in driftwood voice and oceanic hush—silence as载体 of culture. Final image of fog parting offers conceptual repricing: knowledge now carries the weight of unending winter journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains calm, tidal rhythm that mirrors “oceanic hush.” Lexicon stays within collector’s observational bias—he notices seeds, weathered planks, knot geometry. No head-hopping; fisherman’s voice distinct in driftwood roughness versus collector’s hush. Compression is taught early (“oceanic hush” repeated) and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—snow “dusting” planks, fog “swallowing” boats—never stacks up to blur sense. Information density high: each sentence advances atmosphere or micro-gesture. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: knot language as living archive is specific and non-obvious. Patience-as-tool rather than virtue feels novel. Risk is quietness—no explosive twist—yet coherence holds. Fulgurite/lightning-sand motif could feel forced but stays tied to transformation theme, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
