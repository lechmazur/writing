<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo’s interiority stays gentle-observer, never crystallizing into a risky choice; the one beat where he decides to “prove listening heals” is told, not dramatized. His contradiction—wanting to return the locket yet hoarding authority over it—never complicates action, so the ending gift of the letters feels benevolent rather than earned. No embodied cost or visible flaw drives the final gesture; he remains the same curated man we met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letters re-weight the locket from private treasure to communal mirror, with a felt social cost—thirty years of unspoken gratitude made legible. Causality is accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; pattern of dawn courtyard gatherings accumulates testimony until the mailbox reveal becomes inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no prop or knowledge teleport. The −0.4 non-closure cap applies: escalation stays flat—no narrowing option or rising price—so the ending’s reconfiguration is resonant but not urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is sketched with selective sensory strokes—steaming cups, gold light, benches—enough to anchor communal ritual but never constraining choice. The locket and the locked mailbox serve as micro-settings that charge closure; without them the reconfiguration fails. Spatial choreography stays loose (we never see Leo travel to the post office), so the environment informs rather than impedes. Detail is purposeful, but no weather or physical obstacle alters tactics; hence stays functional, not pivotal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can the neighborhood reclaim its erased memory—emerges late, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than acute. Escalation is textural: each dawn adds another sentimental fragment, deepening nostalgia but never threatening loss; no concrete deadline or antagonist forces adaptation. The demolition notices intrude but never complicate Leo’s plan, so stakes stay abstract. Cost is conceptual (collective gratitude), not felt on page; hence mid-band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—communal memory as antidote to erasure—emerges organically through the letters’ reveal, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the locket’s shift from private heirloom to public testament, re-priced at closure. The final image of neighbors reading decades-old thanks offers quiet resonance, though sentiment flirts close to sweetness. No articulated thesis; ambiguity lingers about whether memory can truly save the district.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains gentle, curator distance—polished glass, careful collections—consistent with Leo’s temperament. Syntax stays varied, with rhythmic lift in dawn passages; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic when present (Marcus on skateboard, Mrs. Garcia with flowers). No head-hop; perceptual signature remains Leo’s discerning eye, so voice coherence is high, if unadventurous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Figurative language is restrained—sandstorm calm, rising sun gold—serving tone without overcrowding. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the locket motif efficiently. Density is solid for 700-word range, though occasional abstract phrasing (“subtle thread of curiosity”) softens immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Premise—mystery locket reconnects community—avoids cliché by centering listening rather than romance or treasure. Execution leans sentimental rather than bold; no structural risk or unusual lens. Freshness lies in the letters’ communal reveal, but the curator-protagonist and wise-elder tropes feel familiar. Specific neighborhood details (Maple Street, skateboard Marcus) keep it from generality, earning modest originality points.</comment>
