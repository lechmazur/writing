<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s “purposefully curious” trait is embodied in the deliberate camera work and the sand-grain timing device, not merely labeled. Interiority is concrete (“dawnlit melancholy…settled deep in her bones”) and tracks with bodily action under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting permanent loss in exchange for preservation—carries visible cost and is prepared by prior beats; however, the absence of any second on-page character keeps the crucibal relationship and status dynamics inapplicable, limiting the ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through density of dwindling time and cooling light, not causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—sunrise photo-finish that crystallizes irreversible extinction; cost is legible in the dissolved grain and the vanishing fireflies. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no ambiguity at closure. Minor slack: the mining operation remains off-stage, so the final causal blow is environmental, not interpersonal—still sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: slope, crater valley, and camera tripod constrain every physical move; the dissolved grain and cooling suit create tactile immediacy. Sensory selection favors lunar-specific cold, low-gravel crunch, and bioluminescent blue—never a tourist catalog. Environment directly guides framing choices; the final sun-blasted rock reconfigures the earlier summit hush into bright loss, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—document before annihilation—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is temperature-driven: each degree of sunrise literally vaporizes the fireflies, tightening the photographic window. Agency rests in Elena’s decision to keep shooting past personal grief, forfeiting any chance to intervene physically. Cost is visible: last firefly winks out concurrent with dissolved grain—double extinction that forecloses future observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: progress consumes wonder. The dissolved Earth-grain becomes a quiet metaphor for irretrievable time; the camera’s shutter clicks stand in for memorial ritual. Final image reweights the premise—mining rigs arriving as “bustling sounds”—making the loss social, not merely ecological. Resonance lingers in the tension between human expansion and the price of memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lunar diction stays within a technician’s lexicon (“crater inspection kit,” “camera settings”) while poetic compression (“dawnlit melancholy”) is motivated by Elena’s reflective professionalism. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices temperature gradients and light angles before emotional labels. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for anticipatory hush, staccato clauses for the shutter sequence. Operates at high-band threshold; no slips that touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense: “The dawning hush intensified as the horizon began to lighten” marries atmosphere, timer, and camera prep in one sweep. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors (“weight…like a shroud”) are singular and earned. Filter verbs avoided; strong verbs (“adjusted,” “scanned,” “raised”) propel action. Minor over-modification in “quiet anticipation, a melancholy” is local and does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lunar fireflies as last-night-only bioluminescent exotics is a fresh ecological twist; pairing them with an hourglass grain from Earth-time gives conceptual sting. The extinction-photo trope is familiar, but the chemical-timer camera trigger repurposes a sentimental keepsake into scientific instrument—specific synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk is moderate; concept does not retreat into allegory, sustaining emotional specificity.</comment>
