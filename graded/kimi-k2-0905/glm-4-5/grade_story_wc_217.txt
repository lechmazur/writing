<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The poet’s interiority is textured—“finding the music in crashing waves and still pools” shows contradictory impulses in scene—but she never makes a consequential micro-choice under pressure; the snapped kite is observed, not interacted with. No relationship crucible or status shift is on-page, so the cap for “secondary pressure” is waived, yet her arc still lacks a fork where cost is felt. Motivation is declared (“discover beauty in the incomplete”) rather than dramatized through forfeiture or risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the closure is a Charged Poise—feather bookmarked, poet walking away—where the cost is the surrender of completion itself, reweighting the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cobalt lagoon after rain”), transitions are seamless, no prop teleport. One meaningful tightening: kite release shifts cadence and reconfigures her stance toward “letting go.” Cost is legible in the final image of “forever becoming,” but because the kite is not her kite, the causal pressure is observational rather than instrumental, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cobalt lagoon, drake feather, and weathered journal are specific, body-scale objects that constrain action: feather becomes pen and bookmark, lagoon mirror collapses horizon to charge the final suspended stance. Sensory hierarchy obeys poet’s bias—she notices color shifts, salt-softened leather, child’s cry absorbed—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (feather) participates directly in closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor lapse: “jagged rocks and smooth sand” leans proverbial, but line is brief and does not recur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled early; pressure stays thematic rather than tactical. Escalation is a single cadence shift at kite snap that re-weights her attention, but poet remains passive; no option is foreclosed on-page. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of incompleteness) yet not tied to a micro-choice she must make under pressure, so the tightening is felt in mood, not tactic. Meets low-band requirement for meaningful deepening, but absent agency keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from recurrent images of interlacing—woven dawns, feather iridescence, lagoon sky-mirror—rather than overt statement. Final image of “forever becoming” offers resonant, non-literal answer; no moralizing paragraph. Subtext in snapped kite vs. continuing poem is sharp, but repetition of “incomplete” edges toward echoic thesis; final sentence softens ambiguity with proverbial lift, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at intimate distance, diction poetic yet disciplined—“palimpsest of nature,” “burnished hush”—consistent with poet POV. Rhythm modulates: long syntactic waves mimic lagoon calm, then shorten at kite release to mimic string snap; no template cadence. Perceptual signature is strong—she sees color-shifts others wouldn’t—but occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) nicks authenticity. No dialogue to contaminate; voice sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>High information density: “leather softened by years of salt and sun” does world, history, and body in one stroke. Figurative language is dense—storm droplets as “silver paths,” dawns “interlaced like threads”—yet pattern is taught early and pays off in closure, so forgiven. One paraphrase loop: “finding the music in crashing waves and still pools” echoes prior “harmonizing discord” concept; −0.2. Final sentence “forever becoming, never quite arrived” is elegant but leans toward maxim; still, it recharges motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—“poet who tends shoreline by harmonizing discord”—feels fresh against trope of artist who imposes vision; she collaborates with incompleteness. Synthesis of kite, feather, and dawn-weaving is specific to this voice; removing any piece would collapse the thematic lattice. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is purposeful and paid off. Minor proximity echo to commonplace “cracks that let the light through” caps ascent.</comment>
