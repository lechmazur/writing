<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction appears only in one beat (“his heart steady despite the momentous discovery”). Otherwise the POV is calm, competent, untested; no visible flaw complicates the crank-turning. The final choice—pocket the parchment—carries no on-page cost or risk, so the arc flattens into efficient victory rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization. Voice remains atmospheric but character-specific idiom is minimal.</comment>

<comment>Single causal lens holds: because he trusts resonance over violence, therefore he cranks the modified gramophone until the standing waves force the floor to yield the parchment. Closure lands with conceptual cost—dynasty legitimacy erased—but the price is external (future council) rather than personally felt on the page. Orientation is clean by 60 words; no gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sepia reading room, gramophone, ceiling carving, and hidden compartment are tightly cross-indexed; the carving-as-map and floor resonance are exploited for the final reveal. Golden-shadow light is reiterated to the point of near overkill, yet it does charge the closure image. Micro-setting (crank handle warming) constrains the tactile beat. Economy is good; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose forgery—signals early; single tightening occurs when frequency hits the stone resonance and the floor yields. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; protagonist never risks injury, loss of tool, or social jeopardy inside the scene. Escalation is linear (hum → glow → open) without reversal, so pressure feels incremental, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Truth-through-vibration theme emerges via motif repetition (waves, resonance, silence) rather than assertion. Final image of “truth reigning” is abstract, but the parchment’s concrete proof keeps it from sermonizing. Subtext in the dynastic lie is economical. No late thesis statement, yet the insight remains slightly safe—no counter-argument or moral ambiguity is allowed space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature relies on chromatic light and acoustic metaphors that suit a scholarly saboteur. Rhythm is deliberate, lightly archaic, consistent with setting. No dialogue to test voice divergence. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect slips are clean. Diction stays within plausible Edwardian-esque lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, but metaphor density is high (“golden shadows danced,” “warm fingers,” “bridge of intuition”) and some phrasing loops (“stood...as the first yawn of evening stretched,” “eloquently silent” echoed thrice). No mixed metaphors, yet cumulative ornament slightly dilutes the decisive vibration beat. Pronoun and spatial tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The standing-wave lock-pick is fresh; combines pseudo-science with archival stealth in a way that feels genre-native yet not overused. Dynastic-exposé plot is familiar, but the acoustic resonance mechanic and sepia-reading-room micro-setting particularize it. Risk is moderate—relies on reader accepting sonic masonry—but execution stays internally consistent. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the mechanism collapses.</comment>
