<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s serenity is stated but never truly tested; we watch him perform but see no interior fracture under pressure. The “half-lit epiphanies” are announced rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses, so motivation stays flat. Because no micro-choice visibly costs him anything, the ending’s calm feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle CR: the stick now holds new audience stories, showing narrative power can be re-weighted at social cost. Causality is loose—accumulative lens—yet pattern holds: each puppet show deposits another layer of counter-narrative inside the stick. The cost is conceptual (stories once silenced now inscribed), but the lack of a tangible renunciation keeps it just shy of 7.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The radar dome acts as both sanctuary and portable stage storage; its brutalist hush shapes Elias’s calm and supplies literal space for the performance. Micro-setting also lives in the handled stick, whose carved grooves guide nightly choices. One sharper beat—e.g., a splinter or dropped puppet—would have pushed it past 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing homelessness stigma—surfaces early but tightens only once, when skeptical patrons lean in; escalation is more atmospheric than agentive. Agency stays off-stage: we hear the show succeeded, yet see no on-page obstruction or price paid by Elias. The single calibration shift suffices for 600-word scope, but lacks visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: stories can humanize if multiple voices are physically inscribed into shared objects. Subtext lives in the stick’s muteness—its inability to speak until Elias animates it—avoiding overt thesis statements. Final image of glowing stick re-weights prior material without moralizing, though sentiment flirts close to the edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays tight third-person; perceptual signature is Elias’s hush-metaphor filter, sustained through meteor-hush repetitions. Syntax lightly mirrors calligraphic control—measured cadence, ink-stroke pauses—yet avoids drum-beat monotony. No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherence supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative phrases (“meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphany”) recur but serve pattern, not clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“urbane,” “subversive”) fits character; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands with imagistic punch, propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing calligraphy, puppetry, and decommissioned cold-war architecture yields fresh cultural texture. Stick-as-archive object tranforms familiar “found family of stories” trope into tactile heirloom. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no twist—but specificity of performance-in-bars keeps it from sliding into generic“artist-against-system” template.</comment>
