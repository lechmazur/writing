<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s early-awakening gift and compulsion to “become the voice of the unknown” are stated, not dramatized; interiority drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“she finally understood…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The fossil-touch epiphany is vivid, yet the decision to carry it out reads as pre-approved destiny rather than a costly micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the fossil levitates into her pouch, reweighting her role—yet the cost feels ornamental (no risk, forfeiture, or persistent constraint is staged on-page). Causal chain is thin: because she is “different,” the cave waits; because she touches, knowledge downloads; escalation is more accumulative texture than tightening of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Coastal cave network is sharply sketched through Maya’s rope descent, cool stone, and thermal-color overlays; environment constrains pace and supplies the altar-like stage for the floating fossil. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch, temperature, limited light) stays anchored to her mapping priorities, feeding the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“voice the unknown”—is declared early but never materially tested; no alternative path is foreclosed, no resource lost, no live antagonist or time pressure narrows her choices. The fossil encounter deepens knowledge without tightening risk or price, keeping escalation in the mild, informational register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of transitional guardianship emerges implicitly via the hovering fossil, but the story spells it out in final paragraphs (“she realized… she would be the one to tell them”), dampening subtext. Resonance is present yet competes with explanatory exposition rather than crystallizing through a charged, unspoken image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is coherent—thermal colors, residual hibernation energy—without head-hopping. Syntax is serviceable rather than musically distinctive; some register drift toward abstract nouns (“spiritual significance,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly dilutes voice specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold clutter. Occasional modifier stacks (“factually mystical phenomenon”) and tautologies (“hovered silently in the air”) nudge it short of top-band density, but no artifact obscures causality or dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Emotion-heat cartography grafted onto post-hibernation archaeology feels fresh and specific; the floating fossil literalizes “transitional object” in a way that’s memorable yet inevitable within the invented physics. Conceptual risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but the synthesis of tropes is non-obvious and stays character-bound.</comment>
