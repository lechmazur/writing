<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is anchored early and stays consistent, his interiority is concrete (seed-pod counting, bird-call translations). Interior contradictions are implied rather than dramatized in-scene, and the only micro-choice we witness is the scattering itself—no second option is ever risked, so the cost is more atmospheric than personal. The final smile is earned but feels gentle rather than staked; a sharper renunciation or visible fatigue would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scatter beat thickens the pattern rather than pivots plot. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 100 words; the blooming-jetty image teaches the reader how to read the lyric repetitions that follow. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “renewing reef” image reconfigures the submerged concord with undeniable conceptual cost—peace literally surfaces. The single causality weakness: no on-page obstacle ever endangers the mission; tension is tonal, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment is evoked through selective, POV-filtered detail—dying sun, salt-stained wind, bird-cries as soil-telemetry. The seed pods function as micro-setting: their rattling sound becomes the “soft language of hope” that rewrites the battlefield. Twilight remains the dominant sensory spine, compressing color to ambers and blacks so the eventual wildflower burst feels internally bright. One minor slip: barren/blooming toggles risk postcard shorthand, but the coachman’s sensorial labor (touching earth, tasting wind) keeps it lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the concord via garden—signalled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each handful of seeds raises the same question—“will this take?”—rather than narrows tactical options; pressure is ecological, not adversarial. Visible cost is ecological too: the depleted pods by dawn stand in for the coachman’s spent life-years, but his body shows no on-page fatigue or doubt. Still, the final reef-image lands an undeniable conceptual price, satisfying the 8-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation: war-poison → seed-language → reef-renaissance; no sentence spells this out. The micro-motif of dead languages fertilizing soil literalizes the idea that memory (linguistic, ecological) can be composted rather than archived. Final image reweights “narrow vastness” from proverb to material truth: one palmful of seeds can reconfigure an ocean. Subtext stays implicit; any reader who needs the moral stated has already been disinvited by the whispered dialect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays inside the coachman’s perceptual filter—every noticed detail is a soil-test or augury. Syntax lengthens and shortens with daylight: winding sentences at twilight, staccato seed-falls at night. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the dead-language fragments act as idiolect. One micro-drift: “ttk duelersi” reads like typo rather than taught pattern, but the surrounding phonetic spellings cue the reader to treat orthography as sound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors the act: longer clauses while carriage creaks, then single-clause seed-bursts—“scattered the first handful”—creating an auditory sowing. Figurative control is tight: no mixed metaphors, only one stock phrase (“dying sun”). Information density is high; each sentence layers time, ecology, and myth without scaffolding. The single loop risk—“blooming jetty” repeated four times—earns its keep by becoming the closure’s echo, so the cadence functions as incantation rather than filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses cli-fi, linguistic fantasy, and pastoral reclamation—an unlikely alloy that feels organic here. The coachman’s profession (grief-driven horticultural linguist) is specific enough to resist trope-tagging. Final reconfiguration—battlefield-to-reef via garden—reverses standard eco-catastrophe arcs without sermon. The concept doesn’t push formal risk further than lyric accumulation, keeping it shy of the 9-band, but the synthesis is fresh and memorable.</comment>
