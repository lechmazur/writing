<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven vigil is credibly internalized; the river-stone touch and late recognition give embodied cost. Still, her “shape of hope” motive is stated more than pressure-tested, and the friend-shadow never complicates her stance mid-scene—she watches, then mourns. The final endurance carries poignancy, but micro-choice under escalating risk is missing. Characterization is solid, not quite crucible-tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observed footage → pressed flowers → stone warmth builds to charged poise. Closure is cleanly the moon-lit dissolving-into-light image that reweights all prior shadows as messages, not anomalies; cost is the irreversibility of recognizing the friend too late. Orientation is swift; causality is lyrical, not broken. One soft spot: the “Great Division” is introduced late and functions as retroactive stakes, slightly dilating the tight loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cloud-library is sketched with scent of petals, floating seeds, crystal dome—sparse, sensorily selective, and never static. River stone’s cool weight against palm functions as micro-setting that constrains her grip and later heats to anchor the spectral contact. Spatial choreography stays clean across desk → shelf → dome → moonbeam axis. Setting details evolve (shadows stretch, stone warms), charging the final image without ornamental overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Elara decode the shadow before it vanishes forever? Pressure tightens when the shadow pauses at her stone—one meaningful deepening that forecloses passive observation. Cost is emotional, not tactical: recognition brings irreversible loss of the chance to speak back. Shadow’s agency outruns hers a bit, muting the protagonist-driven turn required for top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond death emerges through recurrence of “shareable dreams” and the shadow’s paper-fold return, never sermonized. Subtext lives in silence: footage without audio, final wordless gesture. Luminous regret reframes hope not as preservation but as belated reception—an earned, ambivalent insight. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in the warmed stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lush, dusk-sensitive diction (“petal-soft leaves,” “silver light through crystal dome”) stays anchored in Elara’s professional lens. Rhythm modulates: long cumulative sentences for watching, clipped fragments at breath-catch. No head-hopping; perceptual signature intact. Filter verbs minimal; voice remains confident, slightly elevated but consistent with an archivist-poet atop clouds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene needs—no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense (“origami in reverse”) yet purposeful, taught early and paid off in final metamorphose. Occasional stacked modifiers (“softly deliberate,” “luminous regret”) flirt with purple but stay within POV lexicon and emotional crest. Final line lands clean, recharging “blooming library” motif without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-revolution dream-sharing + aerial botanical archive + spectral shadow-letters feels idiosyncratic, not bolt-on. Conceptual risk—ghost as unbound shadow—pays off by reconfiguring surveillance footage into love letters. Could not swap stone or library for generic equivalents without collapsing metaphoric bridge. Loses top decimal only because “Great Division” remains vague, muting systemic originality.</comment>
