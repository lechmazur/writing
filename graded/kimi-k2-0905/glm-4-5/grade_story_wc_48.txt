<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and sustained, but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized, so the “earned peace” feels declared, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell on the page reweights art vs. commerce with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds, but the nexus-as-character remains abstract; no concrete cue anchors who/where until ~word 140, triggering −0.3 orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mist, ruin, and shell are rendered with synesthetic economy; the shell finally constrains the gesture of “solemnize,” charging the closing image. Sparse body-in-space cues keep spatial choreography thin, but setting still meets the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. market pressure—is declared repeatedly yet never tested in a live on-page scene; escalation is purely textural (density of mist/shell refrains). No option is foreclosed; cost is conceptual but not viscerally experienced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically via shell helix and “broken yet complete” mantra; avoids explicit moralizing. Final image reconfigures meaning without sermon, though prior iterations flirt with thematic echo (−0.2 for “solemnize the very essence…” line).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—spiral imagery, hush cadence, mist grammar. No dialogue to distort voice; free-indirect slips are clean. Register stays within novelist-as-poet lexicon; rhythm modulates with fog density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but loop-aware: repeated “against the current,” “lucidly watchful,” “swirling hush” create deliberate incantatory pattern that pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; minor paraphrase loops (−0.2) but high information density per sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Shell-as-fractal-metaphor for art is fresh; “feral nexus” leans abstract but avoids genre cliché. Risk lies in lyric repetition; not fully transformative but sufficiently particularized through POV filter to escape template feel.</comment>
