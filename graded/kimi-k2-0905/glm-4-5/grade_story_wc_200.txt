<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his sister’s memory drives every micro-choice (crocodile-tooth tilt, bell shake). The final renunciation of Thomas’s shame is earned by this back-story pressure and costs Elias another fragment of his own lingering grief, visible in the warming tooth. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but motivation stays coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: “crocodile tooth warms” → confess → bell laugh → release. The Orientation Test is passed by word 60; the final image (shimmering ascent) reweights the premise with felt cost—Elias adds another regret to his pouch. One soft beat: the 73-year timeline is stated, not sourced in-scene, but it does not touch the closure turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge is sketched economically yet actively: sound-bending rules constrain tracking tactics; the misaligned harp’s dissonance literally hides Thomas. The cave micro-setting serves as the crucible where tooth, bell, and laugh converge, charging the final release image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices acoustic texture before visual—keeping description lean for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“collect child ghost who refuses confession”—tightens when the harp-dissonance tactic proves Thomas is inside; laugh-integration becomes the only remaining path. Cost is visible: each bell shake burns Elias’s own ache (pouch grows heavier). Agency stays causal; no coincidence resolves the release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: trapped laughter > confession > liberation. The bell’s crystallized laugh re-prices the collector’s creed in the final image, showing grief can be transmuted, not deleted. No moralizing sentence caps the piece; resonance is carried by the upward-drifting light and the warmer tooth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“luminous ache,” “sonic distortions”) is consistent and voice-driven. Syntax modulates—long sentence for gorge acoustics, clipped fragments when tooth pulses—supporting urgency. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is surfaced only through Elias’s bell prompt, keeping psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; information density high (one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffolding: “heavy with whispered regrets” and “laden with purpose” sit adjacently—near-restate—but they occupy separate conceptual domains, so penalty stays at −0.2, leaving room above 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Soul-collector trope is refreshed by acoustic tracking through a broken harp and the reversal that laughter, not penitence, completes capture. The “modestly fearless” trait risks cliché but is grounded in Elias’s private family wound, avoiding bravado. Specificity of method (tooth, bell, dissonant pitch-routes) makes the premise feel singular, not stitched from prompt checks.</comment>
