<comment>Elara’s reflective locksmith nature is shown through tactile, embodied micro-choices (tracing gears, mapping light) that reveal a hierarchy of values—patience over spectacle. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. The final quiet renunciation—accepting the cavern’s teaching and the timer’s thrumming burden—pays visible cost in the image of her “second heartbeat synchronized with the earth,” foreclosing a return to ordinary life. The one flaw: the father’s lock maxim is recalled twice without fresh contradiction or pressure, a minor loop that keeps this just under the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light-mapping beats escalates density until the timer’s resurrection reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: echoes swirl, Elara stands inside an audible past she must now steward—cost is the irreversible fusion of her heartbeat with the cavern’s time. Orientation clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The final image crystallizes options: she has become the living key, exit foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Marble cavern functions as micro-setting that literally supplies the reflection angles required for repair; removing it breaks the logic. Temperature shift (“walls growing warmer”) is sensory confirmation of successful calibration, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains crisp: gears, prisms, reflected light tracked without drift. Weather reference (“wounded season”) is metaphorical but anchored in measurable light variance, so allowed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve communal memory against forgetting. Escalation is textural: each dawn/noon/twilight mapping thickens the pattern until only one alignment remains viable. Cost is the cavern’s demand for permanent custodianship—felt when the thrumming enters her spine. No false cliffhanger; the tightening is the final calibration that awakens the timer, forcing her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from practice: memory needs structure (catalogued angles, locked gears) or it evaporates. The final image—echoes swirling inside a living vault—reprises “store wonder in the cellar of reason” without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: whose voice will she release, and at what future cost? The refrain of “wounded season” reweights from natural anomaly to healed archive, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is locksmith-precision: “fractured gears and misaligned crystal prisms” perceived by finger-traced weight discrepancies. Syntax lengthens during mapping, contracts at the click-thrum resurrection, mirroring heartbeat sync. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no elevated register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for meticulous mapping, staccato for clicks and thrums. Figurative language sparse and accurate—“second heartbeat” is earned physiologically. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances angle, emotion, or tool state. Minor scaffold: “wounded season” repeated identically twice; −0.1 for template cadence that does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: marble cavern as optical loom + locksmith as reverse-engineer of time. Risk—quiet lyric closure instead of explosive fix—pays off in Conceptual Repricing. Premise is familiar “save the culture” but method is specific to reflectance physics and brass gears, making removal impossible. No stock metaphors; “store wonder in cellar of reason” is ownable idiom.</comment>
