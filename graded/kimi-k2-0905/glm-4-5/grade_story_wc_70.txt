<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s forced-truth trait gives her a sharp, story-driving flaw; her micro-choice to lead the agents up the tower visibly costs her professional safety. The final bridge-moment with the weeping supervisor works because her candor is the only conduit to forgiveness. Yet her interiority stays generic (“her heart sank”) and the old man’s despair is delivered second-hand, blunting the emotional polarity needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → truth compulsion → keycard → sabotage reveal. The lacquer-box riddle is the hinge beat: it turns curiosity into trespass and lands with conceptual cost as Elara admits complicity. Closure is on-page—bees restart, wonder and routine re-balanced—but the cost is borne more by city than by Elara, so the tightening feels mid-range, not shattering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lightning tower as vertical micro-city is sketched with selective sensorial strokes (gilded conductors, nectar dusk) that mirror Elara’s habitual wonder. Space is coherent: booth → staircase → transformer wall → apex chamber; no floating bodies. The riddle re-uses the golden glow, letting setting echo theme, but tower geography never actively constrains their climb or final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s integrity vs. civic duty—tightens once: keycard hand-off forecloses her safe observer role. Cost is present (she risks job/custody) yet external; personal consequence is implied, not dramatized. Escalation is linear, not recursive, sufficient for sub-800-word scope but shy of an 8.5+ pressure surge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus dependence emerges through images (mechanical bees, lightning art) rather than commentary. Final image—first pollinators return—re-prices “routine” as fragile, not mundane. No moral speech; meaning stays implicit. A hair below top band because Elara’s internal shift is quieter than societal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative diction stays within Elara’s observant, workaday register; metaphors are sparse, tied to her trade (nectar dusk, gilded conductors). Free-indirect moments (“I won’t be able to stop”) keep psychic distance consistent. Dialogue is utilitarian, differentiated mainly by information load, not idiom—enough for clarity, not memorable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “toll keeper… nectar dusk… mechanical pollinators” packs world, tone, premise in first 40 words. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; sentences vary in length to breathe under rising arcs. Occasional elevated phrasing (“electromagnetic alterations”) slightly deviates from Elara’s blue-collar lens but appears early, taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bee-drones, blackout sabotage, and truth-compulsion feels non-obvious and internally coherent. The supervisor’s “pause the world” motive reframes eco-catastrophe as philosophical protest—fresh angle on tech-reliance. Riddle-box tweak turns tourist prop into bureaucratic key without feeling gimmicky. Slight genre familiarity keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>
