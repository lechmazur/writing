<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation, the family stamp, and the blackout cue a tidy interior arc: from detached cataloguer to self-rediscovered heir. Yet the epiphany is front-loaded (“he understood that some truths transcended classification”) before any scene dramatizes the cost, so the shift feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure. His “tranquilly perceptive” attribute remains label-heavy, never once tripping him or forcing a micro-choice that hurts. Interior contradiction is asserted, not staged, so the character’s final stance lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias cradles the stamp, now reweighted as heritage, and accepts lifelong labour underwater. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—stillness, dappled light, and generational pattern accrue until meaning tilts. However, the decisive change is stated twice (“he understood…he needed to readjust”), not dramatized in a final physical or social beat, softening the cost. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no caps triggered, but the ending’s emotional charge is flattened by summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drowned library is economically evoked—“waterproof chambers”, “towering shelves”, “emergency patches like sunlight through water”—and the stamp’s phoenix emblem re-appears as shadow projection, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s indexer gaze: texture of parchment, handwriting slant, ink corrosion. Spatial choreography stays tight between stacks and flood-proof cases, constraining how he moves and thus how he discovers. Micro-setting qualifies: the blackout’s low-contrast light enables the sigil-shadow epiphany impossible under normal glare.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the texts’ origin—merges with identity stake: “trace honest origins… of himself.” Pressure tightens once when sealed scrolls bearing his family sigil upend ancestral timeline; options narrow from external scholarship to internal lineage. The blackout complicates (no digital cross-check) but does not raise new physical danger; escalation is conceptual rather than visceral. Cost is present but abstract—he must reframe life’s work—never felt as concrete loss or risk on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed heritage emerges through imagery of re-emergent light and re-appropriated sigil rather than direct sermon. Subtext operates in the echo of “dappled” (first ambiance, finally resolve) and the stamp’s transformation from tool to talisman. The ending avoids moralizing, offering a quiet image of new illumination rather than thesis. Still, complexity is limited: no counter-pull between scholarly objectivity versus familial pride is dramatized in scene, only asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains indexer’s taxonomic diction—“deductive reasoning”, “organize disparate pieces”, “micro-setting option”—without slipping POV. Perceptual signature is consistent: light, texture, script slant filter through cataloguer’s eye. Rhythm stays controlled, slightly formal, matching occupational reserve; no head-hop or register drift. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctiveness rides solely on narrative idiom, which remains stable but could risk monotony if stretched longer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythm varied—“Hours passed…”, “A sudden shift…”—with selective sensory nouns replacing modifiers. No loops or paraphrase stacks; few filter verbs; metaphors remain physically coherent (“light like dappled sunlight through water”). One mixed image (“stamp suddenly weighed differently”) is minor. Information density high; each sentence advances premise or image. Copy-errors absent; tense stable; sentence openings varied, giving naturalistic forward motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sunken-archive uncovering hereditary sigil feels fresh despite familiar flood myth, because indexing labor is foregrounded rather than treasure-hunt heroics. Stillness-as-method (“reclaimed stillness”) offers non-obvious tension source. Risk is moderate: relies on reader’s nostalgia for Atlantis tropes, but procedural detail particularises. Final reweighting of stamp from bureaucratic tool to ancestral relic is an inevitable-yet-surprising turn; thus transformation test passes, though premise itself is derivative.</comment>
