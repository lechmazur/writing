<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s obsession with the lost expedition and the watchers is credibly seeded via the father-link and whistle relic; the shift from escapist quest to guardian duty crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—“spiral grooves…ancient patterns that had guided his people”—rather than diagnostic labels. The final nod to the watchers shows earned renunciation, but the causal chain from “crack appears” to “I must stay” is compressed into two sentences, so the cost is felt more than dramatized. Still, micro-choices (tracing, descending, nodding) track consistently with the quiet-drive trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: whistle-sequence → crack → revelation → stance shift. Orientation is clean by line 5 (who, where, when). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s horizon nod reweights his former dread into custodial purpose. Cost is visible—he foregoes the father-quest he has chased for years—but the chamber discovery is narrated in summary rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, so the tightening moment is slightly thinned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shell-as-world is economically anchored through touch and motion: “traced the spiral grooves…beneath his feet.” Sun-bleached salt air, market bustle, and turtle-shift in the final line keep sensory layering. Geography stays coherent—no impossible positions. The great turtle turn at the end supplies a micro-setting that recharges the new guardian pattern, satisfying the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find father / escape rusted gate—flips to “keep the evil contained.” Pressure tightens when the crack reveals the journal; knowledge, not physical danger, escalates. Agency is present: Kael chooses descent, then chooses guardianship. Cost is conceptual—he surrenders the quest—but the chamber beat is rushed, so the price is more inferred than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme of inherited duty versus personal longing emerges through pattern-language imagery rather than statement. The turtles’ endless patience reframes Kael’s obsession into stewardship. Final image avoids moralizing; the nod is gesture-only, letting resonance accrue. Slight deduction for the elders’ world-beginning line, which edges toward abstract exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is tactile and map-centric—“grooves…patterns…spiral pathways.” Diction keeps maritime-plain: “salt air,” “calloused fingers,” avoiding purple intrusion. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in chamber, staccato descent phrases. No head-hopping; whistle and shell function as body-extensions, so micro-setting rule is met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive; only one paraphrase loop (“pattern language…patterns…patterns” within four lines) docks −0.2. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“sunwashed dread” compresses tone efficiently. No filter-verb stacks. Final line varies sentence length, giving cadence lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.4</question><comment>Turtle-city + pattern-language cartography is a fresh synthesis; the rusted-shut gate reframes post-apocalypse as voluntary quarantine. Reed-whistle cryptography feels novel yet internally coherent. Risk is taken in summarizing the expedition reveal rather than staging it, but the conceptual flip stays satisfying. Specificity—“spiral-shell cartographer” as sole practitioner—anchors the world in one line.</comment>
