<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhiannon’s interiority is textured—her perceptual overload is shown through rose-care micro-moves—and her refusal-of-violence stance is embodied in the seed-pouch beat. Yet the因果 chain from “father scoffed” to her present resolve is told, not dramatized, so the cost of that renunciation feels asserted rather than earned. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the arc is a single steady note of tranquil nurture. Still, the specificity of her attention keeps her from sliding into archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sheathing of pruners crystallizes the ongoing project of “healing the fractured world one blossom,” re-weighting the sandbag-turned-pouch motif. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than dramatic; each rose-tending beat thickens the texture of continuity. The lens holds, the cost is the daily labor itself, visible on-page. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome’s condensation breathes with Rhiannon’s rhythm, micro-climate details guiding her pacing and pruning choices. Desert heat versus engineered coolness is returned in the final image, charging the “tranquil blaze” paradox. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating roses. The airship scrap’s texture (canvas, twine) is tactile and re-used, satisfying the micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic—continuity versus collapse—but the only tightening is the incremental wrapping of a single cutting; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the story chooses meditative accretion over risk escalation. Cost is diffuse (daily labor), not a visible price that alters next moves. Sufficient for lyric mode, but barely crosses the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sandbag-to-pouch transformation and the color-shift roses: violence repurposed into nurture. No explicit thesis is stated; the final sheathing lets the image speak. Ambiguity remains—chaos still looms outside—so the meditation avoids moralizing. The “tranquil blaze” contradiction is kept alive rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Rhiannon’s perceptual surfeit; syntax lengthens and softens to mimic humid stillness. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The diction (“inculcating,” “ballast”) fits her educated, post-bounty-hunter context. Rhythm modulates between long humid sentences and clipped pruning gestures, a controlled respiration that charges the final quiet.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean: every descriptive stroke advances atmosphere or character (“condensation forming and dispersing like thoughts”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One paraphrase hiccup—“fierce desire to weave continuity through chaos” repeats the prior sentence’s gist—drops it from 8.8. Otherwise read-aloud rhythm is supple, with purposeful paragraph breaks mirroring the dome’s breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter seed is fresh, and the botanical “value-embedding” method reframes eco-magic as quietist resistance. Sandbag-into-pouch is a lovely reversal of cargo into cradle. Yet the tower-fall backdrop remains a borrowed dystopian frame without new wrinkles. Risk is moderate—lyric horticulture instead of showdown—but the concept commits fully, earning its originality.</comment>
