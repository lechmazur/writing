<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “empirically whimsical” compass is shown through tactile seed-reading and song-choice under time pressure; the interior contradiction between scientific curiosity and reverent duty is concrete. However, the moment of unworthiness (“doubt crept into her mind”) is declared, not embodied—no escalation of tremor, breath-catch, or hesitation in the chant. Because the final stance is renunciation (accepting ancestral flood), the cost is felt, but the flaw that almost derails her remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s glow and chorus reweight memory from “fading mist” to living flood inside her, price paid on-page (“weight of generations upon her shoulders”). Causal chain holds: dream → map → monsoon clock → cave act; no prop teleport. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when anchored by word 80. One micro-turn (doubt spike) is too summarised, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchid scent and thunderous waterfall are filtered through POV urgency; the glowing seed serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image. Ridge geography is stable, distances tracked, weather front moves plausibly. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—sound of waterfall drowns externals during cave entry—meets 9+ gate for environment constraining choice. Only lacks a tactile tool-cost (no bruised knee, wet slip) that would tighten 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural memory extinction—signalled in paragraph 1; monsoon clock tightens to “impassable for months.” One meaningful tightening: arrival of raindrops coincides with seed activation, foreclosing return option. Cost is conceptual (she becomes living archive), visible in the chorus flood; agency remains hers—she places seed and sings. Coincidence (timing of rain + seed glow) complicates rather than rescues, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as memory = living intrusion rather than relic; image-shift from “mist at dawn” to “great beast awakening” carries the reweighting. No explicit moral—final smile of “luminous doubt” lets ambiguity linger. Subtext in gesture: seed warmth answers her palm before any chant—science and wonder co-dwelling. Loses top band because ancestral chorus risks thematic echo of “we are the stories” platitude, though saved by sensory overload rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—“threads of magic woven into fabric of everyday life” is idiosyncratic metaphor that recurs. Syntax lengthens during calmer ridge walk, fragments under waterfall roar, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal song lyric is archaic yet plausible as dream residue. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never drifts into academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose rhythm breathes: long sentence of descent, staccato triple “circles of stones” at reveal. No paraphrase loops; “seed” recurs with evolving modifiers (warm, pulsing, luminous) that track stakes. One mixed metaphor risk—“beast awakening” beside “mist at dawn”—but beasts can emerge from mist, so physics intact. Final line “smiled with luminous doubt” crystallizes tone without overwriting; qualifies for 9+ but for one adverbial cliché “seemed to” earlier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantasy trope (chosen one, magical seed) is retooled through ethnoscience lens—she’s a “reality checker,” not a priestess. Empirical whimsy as occupational trait freshens the portal-cave beat. Conceptual payoff: memory becomes contagious bioluminescence rather than library—turns familiar preservation plot into symbiotic possession. Risk is moderate; could push further if the seed’s empirical properties (temperature, pulse rate) had failed her once, forcing recalibration.</comment>
