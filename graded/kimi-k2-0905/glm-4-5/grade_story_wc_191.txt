<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her weathered fingers, the ruby’s warmth—but “wisely adventurous” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged; every move feels pre-ordained by loreKeeper script. The renunciation at the throne is credible, yet the cost is more ritual than personal, keeping her just shy of 8-band interior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ruby → orchard → paint → throne → renunciation. Orientation is clean by 80 words; closure is Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—she awakens the throne but cannot sit. The lens stays causal throughout; only minor soft-reset feel when “earth dissolves politely” keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective, POV-filtered detail—“digital trees whisper nostalgia in binary code”—anchors retro-futurist texture without catalogue sprawl. The monolith’s paint flakes and the elevator shaft crystallize the past/future fusion and directly enable the final map; this charges the closure image under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prepare throne, not claim it—is signaled early and tightens through sunrise clock and paint mechanics. Renunciation is visible cost, but pressure is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is painfully foreclosed. Escalation is steady but singular; missing a second tightening beat keeps it just below 8-band crest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship-over-rule emerges through action and image, never sermon. The paint-layered monolith and ruby projection reweight power as custodianship, not conquest. Final image crystallizes this without moral tag, but resonance is slightly abstract—cost is felt more as lore than lived emotion, capping ascent below 8-band poignancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains tactile diction—“fractured light,” “transparent wood”—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elara’s trained ear for binary nostalgia. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax compresses as sunrise nears. Distinctive texture is consistent, meriting high-band entry despite minor template cadence in “mechanical sunrise” repeats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean: no mixed metaphor, no scaffold loops, high information density. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) lightly drifts from Elara’s earthy POV, and two adjacent “ruby flake” noun repeats create micro-churn. Artifacts stay clear of closure beat, allowing 7.8 within high-band threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Retro-futurist throne quest is familiar, but the paint-peel map and binary-whisper orchard offer fresh sensory synthesis. Risk-taking is moderate—renunciation rather than coronation—yet stakes feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “memory-formatted forests” and “transparent wood” lifts the piece above template; not transformative enough for 8.5+ but solidly memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lore-keeper label is early; choice to peel paint and renounce throne dramatizes stewardship ethic. Cost is conceptual—she can never sit—visible in final image. Without her custodial agency the throne stays dormant, so element is essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ruby flake glows at waterfall, guides paint projection, and awakens throne—three distinct beats with escalating function. Its warmth and hologram reweight meaning from key to coronation catalyst. Remove it and the entire discovery chain collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unclaimed throne shapes every move; Elara’s mission is to prepare, not seize it. Final projection of lineage redefines her renunciation, reweighting power as service. Story logic would void if throne were merely symbolic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>“Wisely adventurous” is stated in opening, faintly echoed in cautious peeling and renunciation. No visible trade-off or error reveals the trait’s limits; mostly label-plus-action. Needed a moment where wisdom costs her boldness or vice versa.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Final sally through waterfall triggers entire orchard discovery; without this crossing no map emerges. Action is singular yet pivotal, framing the descent. Could swap with “journey” but waterfall texture is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paint-peel method is seeded early—monolith “blanketed in layers”—and mechanically drives reveal of stair-map. Each flake removed escalates hologram; process is methodical, not ornamental. Remove peeling and the throne location stays buried.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orchard’s metallic trees and binary nostalgia constrain Elara’s perceptual filters and supply the oldest tree that hides the elevator. Setting is not backdrop; it provides the only access point to throne. Swap setting and the reveal geometry fails.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Four-hour clock is stated and narrows window for ritual; sunrise triggers throne awakening. Time is tracked but never alters tactics mid-scene—more countdown backdrop than pressure forge. Still, final beat is keyed to sunrise, so removal would break timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stairway desire is explicit from first paragraph and redefined when elevator appears; want shifts from literal stairs to symbolic ascent. Friction exists—she must renounce the climb herself. Motivation drives every peel and descent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia saturates diction—binary trees, mechanical sunrise, transparent wood—and modulates from wistful orchard to luminous throne chamber. Tone charges final image where past and future fuse in renunciation. Any other tone would collapse the conceptual cost.</comment>
