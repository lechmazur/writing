<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—his calm acceptance of harsh winds while ritually binding unseen vows—surfaces only in summary; no single on-page beat forces him to choose between safety and service, so the promised cost never materializes. His “spindrift serenity” is stated repeatedly but never tested by an external threat or moment of hesitation, keeping the character static rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each droplet, hoof-beat, and crimson knot layers texture until the final cadence shift when the gutters fall silent, yielding a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration that re-weights the crossing as an eternal threshold. While orientation anchors early and the pattern is legible, the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than embodied—no live traveler is endangered, no personal stake visibly forfeited—so the emotional price feels oblique rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog-bound crossing, droplet metronome, and worn wooden planks are filtered through the coachman’s professional prioritization of sound and silence, creating a tactile micro-setting that constrains his ritual timing. The yarn needle functions as portable setting-as-tool, its crimson fray absorbing mist, thus charging the final image when the last droplet falls and the needle flashes—meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintenance of the threshold balance—remains abstract; no specific traveler or spirit is at risk in this scene, so pressure never tightens around a live choice. Escalation is atmospheric (droplets slowing) rather than consequential; the final silence registers as cadence shift, not option foreclosure, keeping cost conceptual and stakes low.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise emerges as an organic thematic question: what toll is exacted by endless service to others’ crossings? The final image of the packed-away needle offers a non-literal answer—continuity itself is the wage, paid in solitude—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, yet the absence of a tested traveler keeps the theme hovering above the skin rather than under it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The coachman’s perceptual signature—wind-shift sensitivity, droplet cadence, mist absorption into yarn—creates a distinct interior cadence that modulates with the slowing gutters. No head-hopping or register drift occurs; diction stays within the coachman’s weather-worn lexicon, and the lyric compression is taught by the opening fog sentence, paying off in the final sun-flash on the needle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally through enjambed clauses that mimic hoof-clack and droplet-tick; only two mild scaffold phrases (“with metronomic regularity,” “with spindrift serenity”) repeat, not obscuring closure. Metaphors remain coherent—yarn absorbing mist, silence as music—though occasional elevated adjectives (“palimpsest,” “percolating”) flirt with register drift, down-band slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The yarn-needle palimpsest of vows is a fresh inflection on threshold-keeper lore, transforming familiar ghost-crossing tropes into tactile textile memory. Risk is quiet—no traveler appears—yet the concept commits fully to ambient ritual, achieving originality through compression rather than spectacle.</comment>
