<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anu’s frugality, mystic-scientist contradiction, and tactile micro-choices (saving clay, trembling fingers) stay embodied and coherent under rising pressure; the final covenant marks earned change with visible hand-symbols. Interiority slips once into thematic label (“dusky harmony in his soul”) but recovers. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Motivation clear, stakes scale to personal extinction, cost legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tile’s unfolding reweights his life’s work and brands him with cosmic glyphs—cost felt. Causal lens holds: because he clings to frugal exactitude, therefore he can complete the schematic that summons the tile’s revelation. Orientation anchored by word 60. One soft beat: “Seven years of observation” is told, not shown, but does not break causality. No teleporting props; night-to-dawn clock tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is the observatory chamber and the tile itself; both constrain every move—ink shortage, star sight-lines, tile’s temperature shift. Sensory triage (cool tile vs. warming room) mirrors internal tension. Palace-to-observatory conversion implied in one line but suffices for 750-word scope. Final image projects unknown constellations onto ceiling—setting becomes cosmic interface, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: personal extinction vs. communion with the unknown. Pressure tightens once—tile lifts, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible: glowing glyphs embed in palms. Agency drives every beat: his schematic stroke triggers the lift. Regime change stays backdrop; could have tightened tactics more, but suffices for lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—faith and science as dialects of awe—emerges through tile’s math-prayer and his scarred palms, never stated. Subtext in frugal ink conservation vs. cosmic ink of starlight. Final image of hands offers non-literal answer: body rewritten by equation. Avoids moralizing, allows counter-readings (covenant or curse).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight; perceptual signature in astronomer’s star-number idiom (“numbered with ciphers older than the ziggurats”). Syntax compresses under pressure—final paragraph’s cadence mirrors unfolding tile. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One register drift: “dato felt like cooled honey” slips into modern foodie diction, but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; clauses telescope from stately to staccato as tile activates. Mixed metaphors avoided. One paraphrase loop: “encrypted devotion” repeated twice within three lines subtracts 0.2. Dense information per sentence; no filler. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magic square as astrolabe-prayer hidden between regimes. Risk taken—cosmic uplift in 750 words—pays off with earned image. Avoids boilerplate “ancient astronaut” trope by anchoring in Babylonian exactitude. Could edge higher if tile’s pre-history hinted, but originality solid.</comment>
