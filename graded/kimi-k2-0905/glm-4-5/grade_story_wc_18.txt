<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mirror-maker’s contradictory impulses—yearning to “erase boundaries” while clinging to family ritual—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (polishing, breathing) that visibly cost tremoring hands and thirty lost years. Final surrender to the dream as navigator earns credible renunciation of capture; passivity in letting the creature settle keeps him from 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: sextant now points inward, orchard wall dissolves, dream becomes pilot. “I will not capture you” crystallizes the trade-off—possession exchanged for partnership—under an accumulative lens where imagery density, not causal reversal, re-weights meaning. Cost is felt in the irrevocable shift of the instrument’s function and the fog’s parting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fog-bound orchard functions as both metaphor and micro-setting: thick air literally limits visibility, forcing reliance on sextant and breath; impossible star-fruit charges the final image. Spatial anchoring is clean; ancient trees track across beats. Weather constrains choice—mirror-maker must work indoors, intensifying focus on sextant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he fix the sextant without imprisoning the dream—tightens once when he renounces capture; pressure is accumulative via imagery density rather than external opposition. Cost is conceptual: the instrument’s new navigates-inner-space function forecloses traditional star-charting. One meaningful deepening meets lens requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: “boundaries are merely reflections” is re-priced when orchard wall becomes permeable and dream is freed inside the tool. No final moralizing; resonance arises from transformed sextant and star-fruit image. Ambiguity lingers—freedom shared, yet workshop becomes pilgrimage site—avoiding tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, synesthetic, and pattern-taught (“shimmer of twilight frost” returns charged). Perceptual signature—glass, silver, quartz—belongs to artisan who sees world as refractive surfaces. Rhythmic breathing clauses mirror pulse of fog; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) allowed under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Figurative layering is high but purposeful—mirrors, frost, starlight interlace to create glass-mountain texture without mixed-metaphor clashes. One paraphrase loop (“centuries of thick fog” / “centuries of fog”) minor. Information density strong; each sentence advances image or breath-sync.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: artisan optics + lyric breath-work + runaway-dream astronomy. Sextant repurposed from celestial to oneiric navigation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric overwriting—heightens coherence rather than obscuring. Specificity of mirror-maker’s inherited tremor and quartz shards anchors abstraction in lived craft.</comment>
