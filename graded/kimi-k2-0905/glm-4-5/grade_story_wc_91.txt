<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ian’s interior contradiction—philanthropist who gave everything yet still hoards wonder in jars—stays active; the moment he uncorks a bug he enacts the renunciation the whole piece has been circling. Emotion is embodied (cradling vials, sand between toes) rather than labeled. Micro-choice of releasing the bug crystallizes value hierarchy with visible cost: he surrenders the last source of his “power.” Missing higher band because village girl functions more as oracle than crucible, applying pressure without receiving any change herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Decisive Change—he gifts the collection, ending his era of isolated study. Causal chain holds: detour → meeting → relinquishment, each because/therefore legible. Cost is palpable: “wealth … in the cosmic alignment of purpose and presence.” Slight knock: prophecy mechanics are never tested mid-scene (only explained), blurring lens causality at the edges but not enough to cap below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Black sand, volcanic rim, and synchronized bug-light meet the specificity test; the beach constrains movement (no path to observatory) and charges the closing image (bug rising against celestial glow). Sensory triage fits POV—astronomer notices planetary angles, tactile sand, chemical scent of volcano. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms. Would reach 9 if environment forced a riskier tactical choice, but isolation suits the quiet arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (need to experience, not just observe transformation) is signaled early and tightened when he must decide: keep last source of control or surrender it. Releasing the bug is the irreversible beat that costs him his “magic,” satisfying escalation requirement under causal lens. Pressure coherent; coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Lacks a persistent external consequence—village future, volcano status—but visible personal price suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through object trajectory: bottled wonder → relinquished wonder → earned understanding, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext carried by gesture and final image; no summarizing sermon. Quiet ambiguity remains—will coincidences now desert him?—inviting reflection. Final reprise of “slow dance” reweights earlier phrase from cosmic backdrop to lived state, meeting 9- resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric, elevated register consistent with astronomer-philosopher POV; diction (“texture of transformation,” “charged poise”) stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences build to short, calm coda, mirroring pulse of bugs. No head-hopping; perceptual signature intact. One filter-verb cluster (“he felt…”) is partial cadence dip but not enough to drag score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ear-test passes; sentence cadence varies, no algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is disciplined—lightning bugs as captured coincidence—avoiding metaphor pile-ups. High density: each sentence advances image or idea; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean copy; only micro-slip is repeated “vibrant hush” (three times) but it functions as deliberate refrain, not redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: destitute prophet who accidentally fulfills ancient texts via bottled bioluminescence feels new. Specific detail (black sand, planetary transit timetable) anchors premise in reality, raising it above metaphoric sketch. Risk-taking is moderate—quiet, lyric arc rather than dramatic showdown—but coherence justifies choice. Not 9-level because transformation mechanic feels externally imposed rather than discovered through unique world rule.</comment>
