<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—the “wax cool against weathered skin” and the velvet disquiet sensation make Elias specific. Contradictory impulses (archive vs. act) are present, but the final shift to city-wide preservation is declared more than dramatized; we see the resolve, not the cost paid yet. Still, the emotional stakes scale believably for 700 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy re-weights Elias’s oath-scribe duty into city-wide emotional rescue, and the cost is felt in the silent foghorn & final candle-lit isolation; lens is Causal (because/therefore). Anchors (who/when/where) are clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One transition (memory shard) is taught early and paid off at the prophecy beat, so Track B mosaic is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian slab, wax shaving, and orchard branches are tactile, selective, and return charged in the final image; the skyscraper-top garden constrains access and isolates Elias, literally elevating his task. Details feed POV bias—he fingers history, hears leaves louder after foghorn hush—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography holds as he walks to the pavilion; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve emotional patterns before city collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy forecloses inaction; micro-choice to press wax to temple opens the vision, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (weight of future failure) and felt on-page in racing heart & candlelit isolation. No antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the shaving) complicates, doesn’t resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: archival duty vs. living empathy, the past speaking to foretell a future the keeper must now soften. No moralizing; silence of foghorn and unripe fruit reconfigure meaning without exposition. Subtext sits in gesture—wrapping wax in silk is reverence and fear. Final candle image offers quiet, non-literal answer: one man guarding feeling against darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elias; perceptual signature is archaic-tactile (“whisper of history etched in stone,” “velvet disquiet”). Syntax lengthens under reverie, shortens under shock—rhythmic control without monotony. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom and it does. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“he knew”) they signal intentional certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; strong verbs (“traced,” “pressed,” “leaned in”) anchor sentences. Figurative language is selective—no_STACKED metaphors in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif (“wax now serving as...oracle”). Proofing is clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of oath scribe, rooftop orchard, and Edison wax shard feels fresh and specific; the accidental prophecy twist is set up by childhood memory, not sprung ex nihilo. Emotional archaeology premise could tip into gimmick but is grounded in sensory process. Risky vertical garden setting pays off thematically—elevated isolation above doomed city. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
