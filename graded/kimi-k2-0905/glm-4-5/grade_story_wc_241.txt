<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory motives—mathematical rigor vs. father-haunted empathy—are declared early and re-surface in micro-choices (copying the seat numbers, deciding the scrawls are “invitations,” packing the lantern). Interiority is mostly textured, but a few abstractions (“clover melancholy,” “the odds favor those who understand the game”) edge toward label-speak rather than embodiment. No secondary character on-page, so relationship bullets N/A; the earned stasis in the final paragraph lands because we’ve seen her nightly pilgrimages accumulate. Flaws and misbeliefs (intellectual pride, filial guilt) complicate the final peace without tidy cure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated subway hunts + candle-lit library sessions build density until the final “charged poise” reweights mathematics as communal hope rather than private proof. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration (she forecloses the old axiomatic quest, accepts “beautiful uncertainty”) with felt conceptual cost: her father’s absence and the endless subway rides remain. One scaffold loop—“lucid contradictions” appears 3×—slightly dulls the final cadence but doesn’t break the image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rainwashed Moscow streets, mica-lit library desk, and the subway’s scratched seat 47 are sharply filtered through Elena’s probability gaze; each locale steers her next move. The candle lantern re-appears at pack-up, charging the final image by literalizing “soft illumination” on her new stance. Weather and season (midsummer twilight) externalize the “moving toward diminishment” mood without overt symbol. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object hops.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake: can she convert sterile probability into humane wisdom without repeating her father’s ruin? Pressure tightens when the Fibonacci graffiti mirrors her secret notebook—she must decide whether the universe is signaling or simulating. Renunciation of “mastery” is the micro-turn; cost is the perpetual subway pilgrimage she embraces, accepting uncertainty. Agency stays internal but visible; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mathematics as both poison and prayer, inheritance as algorithm. The motif of anonymous equations left on seats re-weights at closure into anonymous solidarity rather than cosmic code. No moralizing sentence; final image of “language of hope passing between anonymous souls” lets concept crystallize without slogan. Subtext in her quiet packing of the lantern signals acceptance of partial answers—wisdom left ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Elena’s probability-tuned perception; no head-hop. Diction—“cardiac interruption,” “weighted dice,” “cryptic scrawls”—is vivid, academically precise yet emotionally charged. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens when she clocks the graffiti, mirroring adrenaline. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice carries subtext alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences build texture, then quick clauses when she spots the eyeliner numbers. Metaphors (“irony followed her like a personal shadow”) are fresh, mixed vehicles avoided. One paraphrase loop: “widen perspectives responsibly” is restated twice without new pressure, minor but noted. Closure line “just as probability intended” lands cleanly—wordplay compresses theme without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: urban cryptography + grief math + subway relics feels novel yet inevitable. The Fibonacci graffiti twist is set up by her own unpublished research, dodging coincidence complaint. Risk in making a math philosophy story emotionally hot mostly succeeds via embodied filial guilt. Not quite paradigm-shifting, but memorable inflection elevates above familiar “dead parent” arc.</comment>
