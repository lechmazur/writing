<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interiority is concrete—her awe/dread mix embodied in pulse and breath—and the micro-choice to trace the cracked saucer activates her arc. Yet the epiphany “time could not be rushed” is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the daughter’s future face arrives as a wish, not a renunciation that forecloses an alternative path. The flaw is soft-calibrated emotion: no contradictory impulse undercuts the moment, so the change feels therapeutic rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked saucer, now gold-leafed, crystallizes the rule that lost time is honored only by present presence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of birthday images and cloud-mist cadence reweights the stake—and the final image carries conceptual cost: she will live inside each moment instead of chasing its compression. Causality is intact; however, the midpoint escalation is lyric repetition rather than a visible option foreclosed, so the tightening is felt in texture, not tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade is evoked through selective synesthesia—onyx ink drinking moonlight, mist sliding like time—anchoring who/where/when by line 8. Spatial choreography is airy but coherent: cards scatter, saucer is lifted, glade dissolves while her feet stay planted. The cracked saucer re-appears as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather (clouds beneath knees) affects posture and metaphor but not literal choice, keeping the cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost time—signals early and tightens through accreted birthday shards; the pressure is textural, not causal, but still narrows her stance to willing surrender. No visible price is paid on-page (no souvenir vanishes, no relationship breaks), so cost is conceptual; this caps entry to low-8. The protagonist’s agency is attention, not action, which fits the accumulative lens yet keeps escalation gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: cracked → gold-leafed saucer reweights “damage as witness.” Subtext lives in gesture—tracing hands compresses generations into one fingertip—avoiding explicit moral. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: lost time accumulates wherever we choose to look, a resonant reconfiguration without stated maxim. The piece skirts thematic echo until the final clause, but “some mysteries were meant to remain unsolved” nicks −0.2 for near-explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric floats close to her nerve ends: “heart pounding with a mixture of awe and dread” is POV-bound, not editorial. Syntax lengthens during glade dissolution to mimic breath-stretch, then contracts on “dawn approached,” a rhythmic payoff. Diction stays within mythic register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice distinctiveness is moderate—cadence is musical but not idiosyncratic enough for 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: sentences carry double duty (image + emotional algebra) and paragraph cuts are clean. One scaffold loop appears—“time had grown slippery, sliding…” followed by “sliding through her fingers like the mist”—a paraphrase −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (cloud ≈ time ≈ mist) and do not tangle logic. No artifacts touch closure; final line is spare, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The fusion of cartomancy, cloudborne glade, and compressed childhood via doll-house fracture feels freshly synthesized; trope of “mother seeks lost time” is universal but the ritual of tracing hands on birthday cloth is specific and non-clichéd. Risk is taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversals, and it pays off in a final image that recharges every prior birthday shard. The concept could not swap names/places without collapsing its symbolic lattice, meeting the transformation test.</comment>
