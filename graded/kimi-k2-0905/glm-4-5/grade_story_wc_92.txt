<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s calm inventiveness is shown through the quill-tooling and sundial-painting beats, but interiority stays general (“he considered the careful balance”) and contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choices are present yet low-cost; we see no moment where his own safety or loyalty is truly tested. The Earned Stasis lands cleanly—he returns to post with revolution now inevitable—but the price is collective, not personal, so the cost feels shared rather than individually paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the blackout ends and the sundial’s completed angles silently re-weight the field—revolution is now possible. Causal track holds: blackout→painting→meeting→power restored→new status. Orientation is secure by paragraph 2; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the collective risk, but because Elias faces no fork that could expose him personally, the tightening is mild rather than pivotal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fort’s bioluminescent walls, half-painted sundial, and twilight palette create a memorable micro-setting that actively guides clandestine action. Spatial choreography is clean; the quill-holder is tracked from pocket→hand→pocket. Sensory selection is biased toward light/shadow angles rather than tourist catalog. The environment constrains communication methods, satisfying the 9+ gate, though some phrasing (“luminous fort,” “gleamed”) edges toward the generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—spark revolution without detection—is signaled early; the blackout provides a single, coherent pressure spike. Escalation is accumulative: each brushstroke deepens collective risk rather than narrowing Elias’s personal options. No visible personal price is paid on-page; the tightening is societal, not individuated, keeping the score sub-8.8. Agency is present but distributed across the cadre; Elias’s own moment is completion, not jeopardy.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: art as subversive code—revolution grown from “angles” hidden in plain sight. Subtext is carried by object handling and silence rather than exposition; no moralizing sentence mars the close. The final image (sundial aglow, message live) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity is productive: reader grasps that tomorrow’s dawn could ignite crackdown or uprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias with disciplined focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent (“demeanor of calm inventiveness,” “language of angles”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for stealth, clipped imperatives for command. Dialogue is sparse yet pursues goals (“The Keeper requires your presence”), subtext intact. Voice is not radically singular but sustains atmosphere and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean: strong verbs, sensory density, and no synonym loops. Occasional modifiers cluster (“wan glow,” “calm inventiveness”) and one template cadence (“The blackout will end soon,” “The revolution will be silent”)—minor scaffold, not closure-touching. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or intrigue. A few adjectival softeners (“partially,” “merely”) could be excised for tighter propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Angle-coded sundial as covert message-board feels fresh, marrying Renaissance cryptography with biopunk glow. Conceptual risk—revolution via public art—flips the familiar “graffiti resistance” trope into something more elegant. Specific detail (pigment composition known only to the society) grounds the novelty. While the plot arc is classical (act in blackout, message completes), the synthesis of tools and stakes is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>
