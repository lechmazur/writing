<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract self-labeling (“truthful lies,” “knew in her bones”) that blurs embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure visibly costs her anything until the final beat, so the arc feels observed rather than earned. The prism’s warmth is the only embodied cue that her stance has shifted; more bodily risk or forfeiture was needed mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prism stores not just emotion but whole memories, re-weighting her life’s quest. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—frost patterns intensify until the reveal—but the midpoint lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option. The “truthful lies” refrain is told, not dramatized, softening the cost signal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost form a single micro-setting that refracts light and emotion, mirroring the stakes. Water droplets on pillars and shifting frost give tactile, visual specificity without catalogue. The car-window frost is the active interface that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once, when frost patterns reveal full memories; this deepening re-weights the stake but does not narrow Elara’s options or exact a visible price. No resource is lost, deadline pressed, or path foreclosed; escalation is intellectual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—objects as living archives of human moment—emerges through the frost-images, never stated. The final image of Elara wrapping the prism reconfigures her quest from proof to custodianship, a quiet CR. Ambiguity lingers about ethical use, but the “truthful lies” motif is asserted, not dramatized, muting subtextual bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person voice stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: light refracts, frost “tells,” silence “hums.” Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes during reflection and tightens at the reveal. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) nudges register but remains within a scholar-mystic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences do double duty. Minor scaffold: “the quartz arbor in mist” is repeated verbatim three times, creating template cadence that dulls the final paragraph. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; frost imagery stays coherent. Tightening the refrain would lift the line-level above 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Emotional-photography via frost patterns feels fresh and specific to this piece; the prism-as-memory-vessel angle reframes a familiar trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversal—but the concept commits fully. The “truthful lies” tag risks sounding like prompt-echo, yet the story quickly interiorizes it as scholarly method rather than gimmick.</comment>
