<comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “wistfully pragmatic heart” is shown via micro-choices (pocketing the gauge, angling moonlight). The contradiction between city gardener and canal-legacy locksmith charges every beat; her final stance (renunciation of shore life for nocturnal stewardship) is earned. Secondary pressure from Jim is light but sufficient to re-weight her inheritance. Flaw: one “wistfully pragmatic” label recycles; else flawless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a luminous CR: the alcove’s reframed darkness re-prices Mara’s urban gardening into moon-tending, with the cost of perpetual exile from daylight community. Causal chain: petal drop → urge → row → Jim reveal → light work → dawn renunciation, each because/therefore tight. No teleport, no amnesia; the gauge’s dual use (key/helio-torch) is seeded early and paid off last line. Under Causal lens, the final image crystallizes options with undeniable social cost—she now tends a harbor no one sees.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The harbor rock alcove is micro-setting as crucible: its darkness forces the gauge’s repurposing and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—fire-escape pots, leaky rowboat, rock seat, moon angle all tracked. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara attends to scent of earth, metallic water, creak of oarlock, never generic tourist catalog. Tool-as-setting (gauge) constrains tactics and shines the final beam—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mara transmute private grief into public light? Pressure tightens once: the lantern’s dying oil collapses options to either share her moon-tool or abandon the quest. Her agency is the deliberate row-out and beam-work; cost is the forfeiture of sleep, safety, and future daylight belonging. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length; escalation stays causal and visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: inheritance is not ownership but redirected care—garden becomes galaxy. Subtext lives in gesture (handing seed pods to Jim, not speaking). The final image reframes “reflect light” as perpetual unpaid custodianship, resisting moral tidy-up. One minor echo: “protected vulnerability” is named near start; otherwise theme stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is botanical-machinic: moonlight is “liquid mercury,” oar rhythm syncs to pulse, gauge tooth tastes of iron and rosemary. Syntax modulates—long horticultural sentences ashore, clipped clauses afloat under stress. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly fuses thought and lyric description. Distinctive idiom sustained without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: languid opening cadence accelerates to oar-stroke fragments at climax. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and precise—only two metaphors, both moon-related, never muddled. High information density: one sentence often anchors body, tool, and emotional tilt. Final line is propulsive monosyllabic flick—“the alcove glowed”—without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses urban gardener with canal-lock heliography—fresh synthesis, not prompt checklist. Risk: quiet lyric closure instead of violent epiphany, yet coherence holds. Specificity of gauge-tooth as mirror rescues the story from sentimental “light” metaphor. Transformation test: swap gardener to knitter and the whole engine collapses—high originality.</comment>
