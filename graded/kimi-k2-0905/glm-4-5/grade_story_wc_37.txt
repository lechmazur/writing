<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholeness while fragmenting themselves into thread—is dramatized in the swaddling beats, giving us embodied cost (“hands trembled”). Motive intensifies cleanly: restore realm → weave dawn → sacrifice self. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (humming, final weave) do reveal a hierarchy of values. Flaw is poetic passivity: keeper only acts once orchard ecology permits; still, the renunciation lands with felt fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens declared in first paragraph (“fragments of light that never quite dawned”) and held to the final image of “awakened” realm. Orientation anchors—who, where, exotic rule-set—arrive by line 30; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise: the keeper’s rest is earned because every prior swaddle beat has depleted them; the cost is the scattered self left empty in exchange for communal dawn. No causal reversals needed; pattern break (night → possibility) reweights stakes under the lyric drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse+mica window function as micro-setting: window reflects progress, greenhouse supplies the only actionable resource (starlight saplings). Sensory triage—cold mica, glowing leaves, gossamer threads—tracks attention under urgency. Spatial choreography stays clean as keeper moves row to row. Final image of window showing “sunrise existing elsewhere” is inseparable from closure; environment literally reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal dawn—signaled early. Escalation is density-based: each wrapped sapling brightens flora, tightening the pattern toward dawn. Keeper’s fatigue supplies visible price, but external risk remains abstract (no failing sapling, no counter-force); hence tension plateaus rather than spikes. Still, the accumulating glow narrows options—stop and night persists, continue and self dissipates—yielding credible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: social fabric = shared memory = light. Subtext lives in gesture—swaddling strangers’ memories into living trees. Final image reframes prior “mirror world” from despair to reflection of collective possibility. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (keeper lost? saved?). Lyric recurrence of lullaby charges closure rather than stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up maintains steady psychic distance. Syntax stretches to match incantatory song (“leaves of silver and jade”) yet stays within poetic keeper’s lexicon. Perceptual signature—fractured light, remembered colors—colors every observation. No dialogue, so voice contamination N/A. Filter verbs (“watched,” “began”) are sparse and rhythm-motivated; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence length modulates with weaving pace. Density high—e.g.,“phosphorescent flora pulsing with remembered colors” fuses world, body, metaphor. No mixed metaphors; plant-light logic stays consistent. Minor loop risk: “woven dawns required care” repeats concept soon after “woven dawn took shape,” but cadence shift justifies echo. Closure image crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of memory-as-photonic-orchard feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of dying realm subverted by communal, not heroic, salvation. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric weaving instead of battle—pays off via accumulative glow. Specificity (gossamer from own recollections) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic garden; keeper’s self-fragmention is inseparable from setting. No derivative echoes.</comment>
