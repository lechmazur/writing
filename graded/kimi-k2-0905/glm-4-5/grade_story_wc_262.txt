<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is sensorially rich—her fingers “feeling for subtle vibrations,” her mind “mapping hidden spaces”—and her motive (to incubate/release stored love) stays legible. However, the story never lets her make a true micro-choice that costs her anything; she simply receives visions and then promises to “give you voice again,” so the arc is observational rather than crucible-tested. The contradiction that could power conflict (her own unused love vs. the ghosts’) is named but not enacted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not type.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pass over the film strip thickens the emotional density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—who, where, when are anchored by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam carries “forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune,” a conceptual repricing that makes the stored love’s release undeniable. Cost is present—Elena’s tear, the “storm contained within a single human heart”—but because she sacrifices nothing concrete (no lost relationship, no physical risk), the price is felt rather than visible; this keeps it just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered through tactile, lived-in detail—sprocket holes, red safelight, dust motes in the beam—each detail filtered through Elena’s synesthetic gaze. The booth simultaneously expands into a “cathedral” and contracts to the width of a frame, so the micro-setting (film strip as spatial corridor) literally constrains her movement and charging of the final image. No geographic drift or white-room syndrome; every object is handled and re-handled. Atmospheric specificity is the story’s strongest suit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake is clear early: locate and release the “unused love” trapped in celluloid. Pressure escalates by accumulation—each pass through the reel thickens emotional density rather than narrows options—until the final projector-beam act delivers the decisive release. Because Elena faces no external opposition and the only risk is interior overwhelm, the tightening is lyrical rather than tactical; cost is felt (her tear, chest storm) but not tactical-loss legible. Still, the accrual pattern is coherent and drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: abandoned affection can be archived, re-imagined, and ceremonially returned to light. No explicit thesis is declared; the final beam image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through haptic metaphors—celluloid as skin, sprocket holes as pulse—so meaning stays embodied. The concept resists tidy uplift by acknowledging the “bittersweet sacrifice” projectionists made, allowing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually signatured: Elena “spatially imagines” distances in microns, tastes silver halide grief, hears hushed thunder inside ribs—diction that stays within her plausible lexicon. Syntax elongates and compresses to mimic film strip motion—long liquid sentences for incubation, staccato fragments for sprocket beats. No head-hopping; distance remains close-third stable. Dialogue is absent, so evaluation collapses to internal voice, which is idiosyncratic, consistent, and rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; sentence openings rotate across prepositional, participial, and noun clauses to avoid drumbeat. However, frequent stacked metaphors (“unused love…like phantom light…like silver halide crystals”) create slight coherence drag in peak beats; trimming one layer would sharpen. Occasional filter-verb clusters (“she could see them”) dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn, but the lushness borders on purple; still, it serves the textural drive and never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core combo—psychometric crystal gazer + projection booth + stored goodbye letters—feels fresh and non-obvious. Risk is taken: a lyric, accumulative structure that prefers density over plot reversals, yet coherence holds. Transformation test: if you swap out film strip for, say, vinyl records, the metaphors collapse—proof the concept is irreplaceable. Minor deduction for reliance on the already-familiar “abandoned cinema as haunted memory archive” trope, but the synesthetic spatial twist revivifies it.</comment>
