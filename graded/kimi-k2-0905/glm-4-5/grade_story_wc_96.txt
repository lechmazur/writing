<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The poet’s shifting selves are evoked lyrically, but only the Elias memory supplies concrete interior contradiction (“I’m too many people…”). The mission to seed beauty is declared repeatedly yet never forced into a costly on-page choice; the final scatter of seeds feels habitual, not a higher-stakes renunciation. No persistent flaw complicates tactics; competence dominates struggle. Interiority is vivid (“splintered psyche”) but leans on summary labels (“today he was the Builder”) rather than dramatized micro-choice under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of recurrent images (tin, seeds, moonlight) tightens toward a Charged Poise closure—final image of seeds in the tin reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“next year’s forest”). Coherent mosaic of shards (library, prison memory, present rebuild) taught by 25% mark; transitions legible via repeated tin cue. Orientation anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (library ruin) shapes nightly ritual; cost is felt in the poet’s fractured identity even if not yet paid. No meaningful escalation beyond pattern deepening, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted open-air library is tactile: “decaying books under the open roof,” “mangled metal,” seeds pressed into floor-dust. Body-as-setting is minor (hands remember weight) but the recurring coffee tin constrains every move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is crisp across shards; moonlight and starlight evolve with the night, guiding seed-scatter timing. Sensory economy favors visual and haptic; smell/taste absent but not missed. Environment mirrors psyche without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake: preserving fugitive beauty inside a dying cultural shell. Pressure is situational—entropy, vagrancy, state erasure—rather than antagonist-driven. One meaningful tightening: seeds revealed as future insurgency, not mere keepsakes, reweight tonight’s scatter as insurgent act. Cost is conceptual (continued fragmentation) rather than tactical loss; sufficient for 700-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: tin, seeds, moonlight = memory as living rootstock. No explicit thesis; “Anarchy is simply truth without chains” appears on recovered page, not narrator sermon. Ambiguity preserved—will flowers or surveillance win? Emotional after-effect legible in final seed-scatter under starlit ruin. Subtext in gesture (false-bottom reopening) rather than declaration. Resists tidy moral; complexity held.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via patterned metaphor strings (“molting personalities like Phoenix feathers”). Syntax stretches into poetic anaphora without losing clarity; rhythm modulates—long sentences for reverie, fragments for seed-scatter. Perceptual signature consistent: moon, rust, petals noticed through bibliophile’s hierarchy. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within self-taught vocabulary. Compression (“luminous fracture”) is motif, not opacity. Voice converges at closure but reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>High information density: each sentence layers image + action + back-cue (“pressed flowers, poems and a fragment of revolution”). Occasional metaphor pile-up (“luminous fracture,” “cerebral cathedral”) flirts with overwriting but pattern-taught and paid off. No loops or scaffold; pronouns stable. Opening and closing lines echo seed/tin polarity, giving cadence. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts crisp. Minor hyphen inconsistency (“tomorrow's” vs “dandelions”) but no clarity break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Freshest inflection: resistance botany—books as soil, seeds as samizdat—grows from specific carceral memory rather than eco-punk trope. Transformation test fails if library switched to gallery, so concept is anchored. Phoenix-molting psyche risks cliché but saved by Elias dyad and tin specificity. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic) heightens coherence, doesn’t obscure. Some lexical echoes of prison-library trope, but floral insurgency angle is non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>The poet’s molting enables nightly re-invention (“today wearing the skin of a man who measured worth in words”), but only one micro-choice—scatter seeds—is traceable to that trait; no cost or trade-off shown on-page. Trait re-announced in closing musing, not dramatized under pressure. Setup and reprise present; middle development weak.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Tin appears beat 1, reveals flowers, then seeds, then banned papers; each reopening reweights insurgent arsenal. Final sealing with “next week’s uprising” directly shapes closure image. Irreplaceable: no other prop could smuggle both memory and flora. Cost tied to possession risk implied but not dramatized; still drives two+ distinct beats.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Blooming resistance motivates every shelved book and scattered seed; concept named early and reprised in final seed-scatter. Shapes tactics: nightly rebuild instead of frontal attack. Closure links “forest grown from library ruins,” making concept legible future cost. Not merely thematic echo.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>Monthly molt stated repeatedly, poet labels today’s skin “Builder,” but no on-page skill failure or memory gap constrains action; trait ornamental for most beats. Only implied cost is identity fragmentation, not dramatized. Setup present; middle development absent; closure remention only.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Rebuild is the dominant verb—books shelved, columns stacked, seeds planted. Every shard returns to stacking or planting; closure image is “rebuilding the world.” Without nightly rebuild, no insurgent platform exists. Cost visible in worn hands and exhaustion referenced. Action is causal spine.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Friendship origin narrated in reflective block; prison-library memory explains poet’s skill and Elias gift of tin. Memory prompts present vigilance (“They’ll burn our stories…”) and justifies seed-save mission. No on-page interaction, so development limited to flashback. Setup achieved; payoff in final seed vision.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Rusted open-roof library supplies starlight for seed-scatter timing and shelter for outlaw cataloguing. Broken roof lets moon chart night’s progress, functioning as clock. Setting state alters across beats as shelves rise and seeds embed. Final image of forest-through-ruins impossible without this exact decayed structure.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Moon clearing skyline marks story start; climbing moon tracks night’s rebuild progress, forcing deadline (“coming dawn”). Timeframe referenced thrice, creates cadence for seed-scatter before light exposes act. Not a precise clock but tightens final beat. Present in setup and closure; middle development implicit.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Beauty-from-anarchy desire declared repeatedly and enacted via seed-scatter and page-repair. No competing want intrudes; friction resides in entropy and state erasure rather than internal debate. Desire shapes tactics nightly; closure image crystallizes same desire. Told more than challenged on-page, hence not higher.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>“Luminous fracture” is titular motif: broken roof letting starlight, splintered identity, cracked society. Tone modulates from decay to insurgent awe as seeds replace rust. Final line recharges “luminous” through seed-starlight fusion. Coherent across lyric sentences and shifts with closure uplift.</question>
