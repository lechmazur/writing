<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s charm-mask never cracks under monitor-fire; the half-smile is the only external cue we get, so his inner calculus stays vivid. The contradiction—erudite rogue paying tax on memory—is shown, not told, and motivates every micro-choice from gourd-shake to chrysanthemum-row. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent, capping the arc below 8.0. Still, the final “untaxed thought” moment is earned renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new coded medium (dialect, gourd, garden, insect rhythm) layers density rather than causal turn, tightening surveillance net. Closure is Charged Poise: the moonlit rattle transmits through mycelium, crystallizing options—tomorrow’s pattern risks everything, tonight he savors outlaw thought. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the state can tax neurons yet cannot police fungal synapses. One minor skim: the nationwide “resistance” is declared not dramatized, blunting the decisive-change edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, tomato leaf stickiness, butterfly wing-scale dust—every sensory pick is filtered through Kaelen’s rogue-scholar gaze and doubles as camouflage toolkit. The gourd seed’s rattle frequency, the cereus bloom timing, the insect-lure rhythm—all serve as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across seven gardens and one glasshouse; no floating rooms. Could nudge 9+ if one plant species had physically thwarted a raid on-page instead of operating as pure code.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unquantified thought—escalates as each new tax phase (dreams, memories) forces the club to mutate media faster. The tightening is textural: every paragraph adds a fresh carrier (vibration, scent, insect pulse) that raises exposure cost. Agency sits with Kaelen: he elects to plant the night-blooming cereus signal, knowingly triggering “nationwide resistance” heat. No visible personal price (capture, depleted credit) is dramatized on him, keeping the score south of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the multiplying organic codes: cognition will always outgrow mechanized metering. Subtext lives in garden small-talk—“aphids resistant”—where pest biology equals encryption strength. Final image of thought riding fungal hyphae offers a non-literal answer: consciousness is relational biomass, not ledger line. avoids sermonizing, but the “nationwide” scale is asserted, not lived, tempering resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight keeps to Kaelen’s erudite, tactile diction—“rumpled jacket,” “mycelial network”—without academic leakage. Rhythm accelerates with catalog sentences when surveillance tech stacks up, then breathes in the moonlit coda. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet interior cadence stays singular. Filter verbs minimal; one “seemed” slips in seed-shake sentence, forgivable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver tax law, botany, and stakes—“night-blooming cereus… signaling nationwide resistance.” Metaphors stay coherent (storm≈raid, aphids≈surveillance) and pay off. No loops, no scaffold, no purple patches. Minor simultaneity glitch in “shaken above chrysanthemums” while message travels underground—acceptable poetic compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The thought-tax premise is familiar from genre classics, but the fusion of forgotten dialectology, gourd acoustics, carnivorous-plant semaphores, and mycelial network is sui generis. Each code system grows logically from character expertise (scholar, entomologist) rather than grafted cleverness. Risky accumulation of four media pays off because surveillance must fail at the organic interface. Removing any layer collapses the closure image—indispensable synthesis.</comment>
