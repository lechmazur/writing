<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara’s grief-carving ritual is tactile and specific, but her interiority drifts into abstract summary (“harvest lessons from loss”) that keeps us at arm’s length; the lack of contradiction inside the single beat keeps her from feeling truly volatile under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece lands a lyrical Earned Stasis: the carving forecloses the possibility of either forgetting or possessing him again, and the kettle-boil window crystallizes that cost; causality is interior but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank function as micro-setting: droplets refract choice-light, wood grain dictates cut direction; both objects physically guide her hands and charge the final closed-eye lion image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep the dead husband present without shattering—is clear; pressure tightens when the first cut commits irreversible change; cost is felt, but escalation is more cadence-deepening than option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of “holding differently” emerges through tactile returns of rain, wood curls, kettle steam; avoids thesis-statement, but final “eternity” line flirts with abstract flourish that slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—droplets as prisms, grain as intention—without filter-verb bloat; rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to clipped tool-action clauses, mirroring carve-strokes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor engine runs high but pattern is taught early and pays off in lion-mane image; no loops or mixed vehicles, though occasional elevated diction (“crystallized time”) edges toward register drift.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Widow-carves-lion premise risks sentimentality, but inversion to serene rather than snarling lion, plus kettle-boil temporal scaffold, gives fresh inflection; still, core metaphor remains familiar enough to cap below exceptional.</comment>
