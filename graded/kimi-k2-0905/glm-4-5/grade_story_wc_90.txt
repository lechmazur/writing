<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s pacifist conviction is continuously embodied (floating lighter under joy, steady hands while stitching), but interiority drifts into paraphrased abstractions (“profound longing,” “luminous understanding”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The micro-choice to detach the crystal is present yet feels predetermined; no visible alternate impulse is entertained under pressure, softening the sense of cost. Still, the loneliness-is-strength through-line stays coherent, and the final weightless drift renders a credible, earned transcendence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each paragraph layers motif density (tears, recycled metal, compassion) that escalates toward the Charged Poise of the final threshold. Pattern is taught early (“recycled spaceship…echoing with ghosts”) and paid off when the ship itself dissolves, reconfiguring meaning with visible conceptual cost: humanity’s physical extinction is irreversible. Closure is cleanly on-page (“the recycled spaceship silently dissolved”), cost undeniable, no ambiguity. Orientation anchored immediately; no lens slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-settings (meditation chamber, titanium amulet, quantum rift) function as tools that constrain choreography and charge the ending; spatial tracking remains coherent. Sensory palette is selective—spectral Earth shimmer, ship groan, salt-trace map—tightly filtered through Eli’s pacifist attention. No exposition dumps; world rules (gravitational lightening, locked dimension) emerge through ritual action. The recycled ship’s final dissolution reweights the dominant stake, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—open the locked dimension—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens as each stitch forecloses error and body literally lightens, a visible price. Agency resides in every needle placement; no coincidence resolves the turn. Emotional cost scales to extinction-level grief, but the physical price (tears, bodily effort) is slightly under-dramatized, holding the score below 8.8. Still, the final irreversible crossing of the threshold crystallizes the trade-off under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of compassion-as-technology emerges organically from action (stitching with mercy, not weapons) rather than assertion; no moral is stated. Subtext pulses in the ship’s groan and ancestral salt traces, implying violence’s aftermath without sermon. Final image re-prices the premise: love, not war, finishes humanity’s story. Minor sentimental phrasing (“like a flower after endless winter”) keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: Eli’s pacifist filter notices “spectral ghost,” “delicate salt traces,” never military debris. Syntax lengthens under meditative calm, fragments under rift-light, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated diction (“transcendental journey,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots Eli’s plausible lexicon, clipping the top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control: clause lengths ebb and flow with stitching tempo. Information density high—each sentence layers image, backstory, and motion. Minor loops: “recycled” repeats four times in first 200 words; “tears” echoed across paragraphs without new angle. Metaphors largely coherent, but “ghostly resolve written on every line of their face” leans abstract. No artifact touches the final dissolution beat; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Pacifist last-human stiches open a consciousness dimension—high-concept synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Gravitational joy-lightening crystallizes theme inside speculative physics without exposition. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when ship dissolves, fulfilling promise. Strong transformation test: swap any element (crystal→key, stitch→type) and the moral calculus collapses.</comment>
