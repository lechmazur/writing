<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “restore sacred practices” is declared early and remains steady, but interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice—activating the device—does not force a trade-off or visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (“heart ached”) yet drifts toward label-speak under peak pressure. The ending’s “smile” grants comfort without renunciation or tangible loss, so the arc lands as affirmation rather than earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: tendril → visions → invention → communal remembrance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and hold. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the village’s recovered identity is the undeniable cost/gain, felt in the “profound silence.” No constraint or price sticks to Elara herself, keeping the change communal rather than personal, hence the ceiling short of 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Verdant arbor” is more postcard than crucible, yet the vine-as-tool micro-setting does constrain invention and is recharged in the final cadence. Sensory selection favors visual dapple and golden light; other senses appear once each, adequate for short length. Spatial choreography holds; bodies track cleanly around the central device. The arbor never actively endangers or rescues, so environment shapes mood, not tactics, capping at low-8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural memory loss—signals early and tightens once: “before the harvest moon reached its zenith.” The protagonist’s agency is confined to assembling songs; the village’s remembrance is the payoff, but Elara faces no live risk or forfeiture. Escalation is thus observational rather than personally costly; pressure accumulates for the group, not the hero. Meets single-deepening standard for short form, but absence of personal cost keeps it sub-8.5.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of cultural continuity emerges through song-restoration rather than exposition, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the elders’ wordless sway and children’s wonder, letting reader bridge past/present. Final image of “first birds” reprises dawn frame, offering quiet CR that reweights silence as fullness. Ambiguity is modest; complexity stays communal rather than individual, hence high-7 rather than 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains lyrical, fairy-tale cadence with controlled repetition (“verdant arbor,” “golden stories”) that serves incantatory effect. Diction stays within tinkerer-storyteller lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Sentence rhythm modulates—long breathless builds vs. short declarative capping beats—mirroring rising song energy. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal coherence and texture are strong enough for mid-8.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean: no scaffold loops, no synonym churn, metaphors consistent (“spun golden stories” thread holds). One mixed image—“sand through fingers” beside “loom of song”—but clarity survives. Information density good; most sentences advance plot or image. Final third stays artifact-free, allowing 8+ band. Minor over-modifying (“enormous and amber”) keeps it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Familiar “last ritual before eclipse” frame is refreshed via tech-meets-nature device, but core beats (visions → assembly → communal catharsis) follow predictable uplift arc. Specificity of vine-as-antenna and songs-as-data elevates above template, yet emotional payload is collective nostalgia without twist. Risk level moderate; transformation more combinational than subversive. Sufficient particularity to exceed mid-band, not enough to feel inevitable-in-hindsight.</comment>
