<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and tactile engagement with the passage are vivid, but her interiority never knots into contradiction; the “weight of legacy” is announced, not dramatized through micro-choices that cost her anything. The final commitment reads as serene escalation rather than a stance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (diaries, negative) layers sensory memory until the ivy passage is re-priced as a living archive. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“she carried the weight”—but the beat is compressed into a single declarative sentence; the therefore-linkage between Thorne’s abrupt end and her own assumed burden is implied, not stated, keeping the change just legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is rendered through touch, sound, and temperature; the fireplace micro-setting gives tactile access to lost time. Spatial choreography is clean from corridor to chamber to lab bench. The environment does not yet force a tactical trade-off, so it charges atmosphere more than choice, capping access to 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each artifact proves the walls do remember. Yet escalation is observational: she glimpses, reads, develops; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The tightening is cognitive, not consequential, satisfying the lens but not the 8.8+ cost gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as sedimented human presence in stone. The negative’s revelation reweights prior echoes from mystique to archival proof, achieving a quiet Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will she share or hoard the dreams?—inviting reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—sonic, tactile, temperature-driven—with rhythmic compression under rain. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Voice modulation is subtle but consistent, earning the high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; minor scaffold appears (“she realized with a thrill,” “she recognized the weight”) but does not stall momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; syntax varies. A single filter-verb cluster in the lab paragraph keeps the score shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sonic-archivist premise feels fresh; the diaries-inside-fireplace discovery rescues the trope from simple salvage quest. Transformation is present: the negative bridges sound and image, making architectural memory multi-sensory. Specificity of echo-cartography tools and climate-shifted ivy city roots the concept; slight deduction for thematic echo of “walls dream” in closing line.</comment>
