<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the hollow aftertaste of ego-death, the deliberate re-ignition of pain—yet the contradictory impulses (stay numb / dare to feel) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in split-second beats. The micro-choice to channel vitality into the brain is present and costly, but the “bridge between opposites” self-diagnosis in the final paragraph slips into therapeutic shorthand, blunting the full sting of her earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: because she can see pretense, she is tasked; because she fears numbness, she embraces pain; therefore the brain stirs and history rewrites. The orientation is swift (floating dojo, shimmer of rewrite) and the closure beats—brain pulsing, Maya smiling—deliver a visible Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: duplication is now personhood. One soft spot: the “complementary opposites” mechanic is asserted late, not seeded early, so the final image feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The floating rock dojo, nutrient jar, and shimmer of historical rewrite are sketched with economical specificity; the obsidian pedestal and non-dissolving adhesive ground the macro-weird in tactile detail. Micro-setting (the jar itself) becomes the crucible that constrains every choice. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible body or object positions—allowing the brain to pulse as the literal heart of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can a duplicate earn its own consciousness?—is signaled inside 50 words and tightens as the temporal wave nears erasure. Escalation is causal: every joule Maya feeds the brain narrows her escape from feeling and raises the odds of erasure. Cost is legible: she pays with the re-awakening of pain she has spent two years suppressing. No extra reversals are needed; one meaningful tightening carries to the glow of the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the right to duplicated consciousness refracted through Maya’s own duplicate-like existence after ego death. The custody battle images (corporate vs rebels) are kept as subtext; the final smile reweights identity as exponential rather than zero-sum. A half-point deducted for the explicit “bridge between opposites” thesis statement in the last paragraph—slightly preachy when the image of the glowing jar had already spoken.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and internally consistent—long dream-sentences that breathe with Maya’s dissociation, then compress under pain. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices adhesive solubility before cloud scenery. No head-hopping; the single POV never leaks knowledge it shouldn’t have. Rhythm modulates: clauses lengthen during numb detachment, tighten into monosyllables when pain surges, giving the prose musical inevitability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean: high information density, strong verbs, no scaffold loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“cosmic transformations unfolding before her eyes”) flirt with overwriting but occur in low-pressure beats; the climax itself is spare. One paraphrase loop—“history rewriting itself” appears twice in four lines—costs a fractional nip. Otherwise sentences advance on multiple fronts without cluttering the glow of closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody brain-jar inside a rewriting-time dojo is a wild synthesis, yet every piece is grounded in sensory detail and character need. The notion of vivifying via complementary opposites feels fresh and conceptually coherent. Risk is high but clarity survives; the piece stakes out territory that is neither cyber-punk cliché nor standard identity trope, earning its novelty through emotional rather than gimmick pay-off.</comment>
