<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shadow-keeper’s contradictory impulses—craving isolation yet answering the call—are dramatized through micro-actions (thumb on ring, rising from ash). Her scars ache, embodying the cost of past choices. The final hand-extension feels earned because every prior bridge-burning step is visible in the ashen dust she swept. Only the “someone barely breathing” remains a cipher, preventing full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary is abandoned, isolation foreclosed, cost felt in the dawn she now must share. The causal chain holds: ring warmth → three knocks → door → reciprocal scars. The 97-day countdown and bridge-burning flashbacks are anchored to present stimuli (ash patterns, ring pulse). Final image reweights the premise: emptiness is no longer refuge but loneliness paid for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The charcoal sanctuary is not backdrop but tool: ash under fingernails, starlight as mortar for the threshold. The doorknocker’s carvings and pulsating temperature are tactile constraints that decide her stance. Spatial choreography is clean—north wall, mat, threshold line—guiding her three-knock ritual. Micro-setting (ring, ash, starlight) charges the final image and would break if swapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guard threshold vs. abandon isolation—tightens when ring warmth intrudes. One meaningful deepening: she sweeps ash → realizes dust is memory → chooses to leave. Cost is visible: she forfeits the sanctuary’s promised peace and accepts the dawn’s social oxygen. Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through ash, scars, bridges: solitude as self-inflicted suffocation. Final dawn image re-prices “emptiness” from refuge to loneliness without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: extending scarred hand silently argues connection over isolation. No thematic echo; insight is earned by ash patterns and ring pulse, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured voice—“tender shadow keeper,” “loaded emptiness”—stays consistent, modulation tightening as ring warms. Syntax mirrors breathless threshold state: comma-spliced starlight sentences yield to short declarative knocks. Perceptual signature filters world through ash, starlight, scar-ache. No dialogue to test, yet voice remains idiosyncratic and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: three-beat knock sequence creates ceremonial cadence; paragraph breath mirrors her sweeping then decisive rise. Information-dense lines (“ashes turned to ash” compresses memory, loss, medium). Metaphors stay coherent (threshold = starlight + sorrow). Zero loops; no scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: caretaker of liminal ash who must burn her own bridge to isolation. Doorknocker ring as portal key made from sorrow is particular, not stock. Conceptual risk—teaching suffocating to breathe—lands via scar-link rather than cliché. Transformation test fails if keeper is generic hermit; ash-as-memory and reciprocal scars make it inseparable from this telling.</comment>
