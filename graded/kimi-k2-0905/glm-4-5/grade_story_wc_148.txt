<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The son’s need to escape his father’s legacy of lies is clear, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“he practiced his truth in the mirror”) rather than dramatized micro-choice; embodied emotion is strong in the lattice-touching beats, yet the climactic “whisper the truth” is reported, not shown under pressure, so the renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the decision to speak truth rather than cry wolf reconfigures his inherited trap and carries felt cost (“before they find the bodies”). The accumulative pattern (lattice / copperlight / door scuffs) tightens toward the final image; causality is lyric rather than strict, but the lens holds and the orientation anchors within the first 120 words, satisfying the mosaic track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison and jagged reef are not postcard backdrop: the reef claims ships, the lantern beam sweeps his cell, the salt scent permeates his breath; the lattice functions as micro-setting that absorbs his whispered words and later bears his new story, directly constraining the final choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—be believed when it matters—signals early; pressure tightens through the returning “before they find the bodies” beat, turning the inherited lie into mortal stakes; the final whisper is a credible renunciation with implicit cost, though escalation is more cadence-driven than causal, keeping it just shy of the 8.5 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—legacy of lies versus chosen truth—emerges through recurrent lattice / wolf / silence motifs; the final image of the lattice now bearing *his* story reweights earlier material without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance, though the absence of a second character limits thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric first-person–flavored third-person sustains a hushed, penitent cadence; perceptual signature is consistent—copperlight, salt, woodgrain—and the prose modulates under pressure; patterned repetition (“through the scuffs…”) is taught early and paid off in the final line, meeting the 9+ threshold for rhythmic control without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High-density imagery (“copperlight repose,” “ghosts refusing to be exorcised”) remains purposeful; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops; scaffolding is minimal, though occasional stacked modifiers approach overwriting—density penalty held to −0.3 because closure image stays clear and propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Inversion of the fable into a prison-confessional lyric is non-obvious; the lattice as literal screen for absolution freshens the conceit; risk lies in near-poetic repetition, but specificity of reef-wreck and inherited lie keeps it from feeling schematic; fresh enough, not revolutionary.</comment>
