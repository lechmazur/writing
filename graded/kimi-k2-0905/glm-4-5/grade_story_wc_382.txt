<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara’s curiosity about “architectural dialect” is vivid, but her interiority slips into exposition (“it’s inheritance…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Mr. Abernathy’s politely nimble grace is shown once, then told repeatedly; we never see that trait complicate a choice. The familial reveal lands as abstract information, not a decision she must weigh under pressure—no visible cost is paid by either character.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal passes to Clara, reweighting her world (“the beginnings of fluency…”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds on an Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor-light on brass re-illuminates every earlier symbol, tightening pattern rather than plot. Orientation is clear by word 70; the rooftop jump is a single, legible shard transition. Setup/payoff coherence is clean, but the final beat is more image than irreversible decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The historic district is sketched via selective, POV-filtered details—symbols on windowsills, creaking timbers—never catalogued. Rooftop garden space is economically anchored: cushions, potted plants, city glitter below, all narrowing to the seal’s brass gleam. Weather (meteor shower) is integrated into the closure image, charging rather than decorating. No object or environment constrains a tactical choice enough to reach the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—gaining fluency in buildings’ language—is signalled early. Pressure escalates through pattern density: each weekly tea layers symbol recognition until the rooftop deepening under meteor light reweights the same symbols with ancestral cost. No reversible choice or forfeiture is forced; the tightening is perceptual rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual, felt, but not paid by character action—hence mid-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as heritage-as-language: stone and brass speak only to blood-listeners. Subtext is carried in silence—the trembling hand that never explains the seal until skyfire makes words unnecessary. The ending image reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Some late exposition (“buildings speak to those who share their blood”) edges toward thematic echo, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Clara’s perceptual filter—symbols “she recognized immediately,” sky “like constellations on earth.” Syntax stays restrained, slightly hushed, matching the “mysterious familiarity” brief. No dialogue requires distinct idiom; interior voice remains consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral as forgotten words”) drifts above Clara’s apparent lexicon but within lyrical tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, with purposeful paragraph variation; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (“city skyline glittering below like constellations on earth”). Filter verbs are minimal; information density is high. One mixed image—“language that had been waiting centuries to be understood again”—is forgivable at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes the tired “old houses speak” trope by fusing dead-language philology with masonry, then grounding it in genealogical secrecy. Specificity of brass seal carved with district-specific sigils feels discovered, not bolted on. Rooftop meteor shower as illumination of hidden script is a fresh inflection. Risk is moderate; execution keeps clarity, earning upper-mid band.</comment>
