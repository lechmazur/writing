<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maya’s motives are sketched—curiosity plus “equations for hope” ambition—but her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we’re told she is stoic yet “eyes alight,” never shown wrestling with fear of failure or ethical qualms about tampering with derelict infrastructure. The sextant piece acts as a lucky talisman more than a value-revealing choice; her engineering decisions are friction-free, lacking misbelief or flaw that could compound cost. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; the resurrection succeeds on first try, so no hierarchy of values is tested. Earned stasis arrives but the price feels external (rust, darkness) rather than personal, keeping motivation functional yet not fully lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing: the relit terminal reweights the sextant from antique relic to navigational beacon for future community energy, with a felt social cost of “communities left behind.” Causal linkage, however, is thin: Maya’s rewiring plan is asserted, not seeded with earlier obstacles or partial failures, so the decisive change reads as fortunate rather than earned. The sextant’s inscribed coordinates appear at the exact narrative moment they’re needed, a mild coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, but still convenient. Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—lights awakening cadence reweights hope—but persistent constraint is only implied, not shown shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Spaceport shell is evoked with tactile specificity—dust on console, dormant transformers “like sleeping giants”—and the micro-setting of corroded breaker panels constrains her rewiring choices, charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong: echoing footsteps narrow to the glint of brass, mirroring the shift from vast absence to pinpoint possibility. Temporal anchoring is clear, spatial choreography clean. Brass sextant piece satisfies the 9+ gate by functioning as the charged final object that reframes prior journeys.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove hope viable via revived terminal—is early signaled, but escalation is mostly atmospheric (lights flickering) rather than a tightening of actionable options. No credible loss or tool scarcity alters tactics; corroded circuits are bypassed without visible trade-off. Single micro-turn is the throw of the main switch; luck substitutes for renunciation or risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for Accumulative lens but not deeply felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of navigation-as-hope emerges organically from sextant + spaceport pairing; no explicit thesis is preached. Subtext rests in the silence after carnival—life’s itinerant spectacles depart, leaving infrastructure for those willing to read old instruments anew. Final image of “charted course toward the future” reframes earlier maze of intentions without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: will restored lights attract exploitation? Complexity is invited, not closed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s engineer perception—selective attention to conduits, voltages, brass gleam—without head-hop. Diction is controlled, slightly elevated but consistent with an intern who thinks in equations. Rhythm breathes with the flicker sequence, sentence length varying from clipped rewiring motions to longer luminous cadence. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained; filter verbs minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high density, no scaffold loops; metaphor count is spare and justified (“sleeping giants”). Occasional elevated phrasing—“luminous cadence of awakening stars”—skirts but avoids purple by serving tonal crescendo. Opening line anchors stakes and voice cleanly; final line offers image-based resolution. Minor paraphrase echo: “maze of intentions” repeated without new inflection, a –0.2 tick.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sextant nostalgia with derelict spaceport feels non-obvious and conceptually fresh; trope inversion turns antique navigation into future energy roadmap. Specificity of brass coordinates etched on reverse side supplies verifiable detail that generic relic couldn’t carry. Risk is taken with quiet, solo victory rather than blockbuster rescue, and coherence holds.Transformation test: swapping sextant for, say, old ticket stub would collapse the thematic navigation hinge—element is integral, not ornamental.</comment>
