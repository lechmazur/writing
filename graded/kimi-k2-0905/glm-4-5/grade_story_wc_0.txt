<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s shift from cosmic to micro-focus is well-anchored in her perceptual lens; the interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the final stance of “witness and honor” is earned by the accumulated dust-garden beat. However, no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never fights the return to astrophysics or resists the humility—so the change feels like acceptance rather than costly renunciation. The butterfly-wing dust as talisman is character-specific, yet its handling is observational, not a micro-choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers dust/renewal images that tighten the stake toward “strip needless drama.” The closing image of the damp-wing butterfly reweights the premise with CR cost—her career lens is permanently recalibrated. Orientation is clear by line 3; no因果 breaks. The one soft spot: no on-page risk or forfeiture is dramatized; the cost is conceptual, not felt, so closure lands as Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting functions as crucible: cracked pots, rotted stems, and dust films physically constrain where she steps and what she sees; the butterfly-wing shard literally charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her scientist bias—she catalogs decay patterns like data sets—keeping POV-filter tight. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating glass or impossible reaches. The environment’s state evolves causally (flood → rot → seedlings → butterfly), mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“strip needless drama”—is signaled early and deepens through each dust-layer observation; the tightening is textural rather than causal, but the final image reweights her professional identity with undeniable conceptual cost. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; pressure accrues via rot-to-rebirth imagery. Agency is present in her daily documenting, yet no tangible loss (grant, reputation, time) is risked on-page, keeping cost legible but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the same thermodynamics that shred stars also spin butterfly scales—grandeur in minutiae is shown, never declared. The dust motif recurs with shifting valence: first as decay trace, finally as cosmic spiral, earning CR resonance. No moralizing summary; the last clause “small, humble miracles” is uttered by action, not sermon. Avoids pat epiphany; complexity lingers in the unsaid—she will still study stars, but through a humbled lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Elena’s scientist-perceiver diction: “preprocess reality,” “spiral galaxies,” “language of decay.” Rhythm modulates—long Latinate clauses for star data, staccato noun phrases for wreckage—mirroring attention shift. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied (“she collected the delicate dust”). The final sentence’s quiet cadence crystallizes voice without syntactic drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and concept (“flood had receded… leaving… broken glass and wilting plants”) without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—dust as data, greenhouse as cathedral—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and cosmic/earth juxtaposition; final line resolves by image that recharges dust→spiral motif. Minor over-alliteration (“damp earth and decay”) is voice-motivated and forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—astrophysicist re-grounded by butterfly dust—offers fresh angle on “scientist learns humility” trope. Spiral-galaxy/dust fractal parallel is non-obvious and specific to her discipline. Risk lies in quiet lyric mode; stakes stay conceptual, not visceral, limiting punch. Transformation passes test: swap butterfly for fallen leaf and the cosmic echo collapses—detail is irreplaceable. No derivative template echo; avoids sentimental nature writing clichés.</comment>
