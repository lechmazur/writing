<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“bleak exhilaration…constant companion”—but Elias’s emotional palette cycles between grief and purpose without contradiction in scene. No micro-choice visibly costs him; placing the geode feels inevitable, not staked. The survival backstory is label-driven (“drone strike wedding survivor”) rather than embodied. Closure smiles without prior facial tension, so the shift reads cosmetic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: geode → coordinates → descent → absorption → transformed crystal → next hunt. Closure is a Decisive Change—Elias gains new agency—yet the cost is only asserted (“he was becoming something else”), not felt. Observatory systems’ reboot window supplies external urgency, but interior stakes stay abstract. Lens holds; no orientation lag.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mutated garden and amphitheater are sketched with ozone, twisted metal, liquid-light potential—selective, sense-driven. Micro-setting succeeds: the geode’s glow dictates pod interior and landing spot.Floating observatory stays postcard; no spatial constraint alters tactics. Final image uses setting only as backdrop, not tool, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest potential to “make a difference”—is declared early but never tested against a visible alternative or risk. Escalation is linear absorption without reversal; tension is atmospheric, not option-narrowing. Circuit-breaker countdown is off-stage; Elias never races it on-page. Cost is conceptual, not tactile, so pressure stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of recycling collective lost dreams into new power emerges imagistically through the geode’s color shift. No moral is stated; resonance is conceptual. “Bleak exhilaration” is named, not dramatized, so emotional after-effect is muted. Particulars (amphitheater, wedding ashes) keep it from abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—“colors that shouldn’t exist.” Diction is lyrical yet controlled; no filter-verb clutter. Repetition of “intangibly tangible” and “bleak exhilaration” edges toward template cadence but remains voice-motivated. No dialogue to test distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional fragments that mimic geode pulses. Occasional scaffold—“the hunt led him… the potential pooled”—but information density is high. Metaphors stay coherent. No artifact touches closure; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic potential-mining via geode compass is fresh; “perturbation theory” freshens genre math. Survivor-guilt trope is familiar, but synthesis with dormant-energy harvesting feels non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric sci-fi in 700 words—yet specificity (amphitheater, observatory) keeps it from template. Could swap “geode” for another crystal with minor edits, limiting high-band entry.</comment>
