<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ethan’s “analytically artistic” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment where the two impulses clash; the interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“he sensed rather than understood”) that flattens emotional pressure. The phantom punch integrates physically, yet its selection of him is asserted, not earned through visible flaw or choice. No contradictory micro-choice under stress shows the hierarchy of values; the story tells us the punch “had chosen him” instead of dramatizing a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reweights the premise—he now sees “invisible connections” and will return nightly, a conceptual cost tied to eternal cartography of secrets. Causality holds under accumulative lens: each beat layers wonder rather than forcing tight because/therefore links, and the final crystallization is legible. Orientation is clean by word 50; no ambiguity persists at exit. The punch’s first chime is a micro turn that tightens, satisfying the single escalation requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Copper box, semi-transparent punch, and starlit vault are rendered with concise sensory triangulation; the punch’s warming vibration is tactile and purpose-driven. Selective detail—cracks resolving into “increasingly intricate pathways”—mirrors Ethan’s mindset without cataloguing the tunnel. The vault’s mist coalescing into stasis-emotions is a fresh, micro-setting image that charges the final fortress reveal. Spatial choreography holds: the punch beams outward to translate fortress walls, anchoring the setting as active translator rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early; pressure accumulates through wonder-density rather than option-loss. The single meaningful tightening is the punch’s beam-opening of the fortress, a deepening that changes knowledge, not tactics. Cost is conceptual (nightly return, burden of seeing hidden truths) but not viscerally felt on-page; no resource is lost or risked. Escalation is atmospheric, adequate for accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible price that alters immediate capability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mapping as moral act—cartography of human secrets versus geometric certainty—without explicit statement. The ouroboros punch and starlit vault reweight the premise at exit, offering a non-literal answer about infinite self-examination. Subtext operates in gesture (the punch warming, cracks arrowing) rather than declaration; no final moral is delivered. Ambiguity lingers: is he blessed or condemned? Complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature—“geometric symphonies,” “conceptual symphonies”—is idiosyncratic and tied to Ethan’s mindset. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under wonder (“He looked down and felt…”) elongate into cadenced reflection, mirroring breathless ascent. No head-hopping; interiority stays anchored. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a meticulous mapper intoxicated by mystery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty—image plus emotional charge (“the object integrating with his hand, becoming part of him while remaining separate”)—with natural rhythm variation. Minor template cadence in “Each step forward was a dare…” trio, but it echoes ritual progression, hence tolerated. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Scaffolding is light: one paraphrase loop (“analytically artistic mind” repeated) costs −0.2, keeping score sub-7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar “chosen artifact opens hidden realm” trope is refreshed by cartographer POV and the punch-as-translator mechanic, turning mapping into moral vocation. Specificity—serpent-insignia punch, fortress of encrypted light—grounds abstraction in tactile detail. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulative structure over classic confrontation. Synthesis feels inevitable: only a route-mapper would read cracks as arrows; premise commits fully without late rule change.</comment>
