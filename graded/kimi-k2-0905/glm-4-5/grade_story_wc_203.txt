<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s ghost-seeing is label-only until late; his “skillfully observant” trait stays ornamental. The decisive act—lifting the barrel to seal the cracks—arrives without prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives, so cost feels conceptual rather than earned. Interiority is vivid (“weightless burden”) but never contradictory under pressure. Closure leans on Charged Poise, not a hierarchy of values tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: 4:16→4:17 silence→cracks open→barrel response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking barrel crystallizes Marcus’s stance, reweighting his curse as calling. Cost is legible in the final image—“rhythmic heartbeat cleaving through the barrier.” Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>Ticket-office ceiling becomes micro-setting that constrains tactics: dust spirals map the ghost breach and guide the barrel placement. Fluorescent buzz taught as temporal anchor early; its final absence tightens the silence that lets the crack widen. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and auditory, matching an elevator tech’s bias toward vibration and vertical space. Specific noun economy—“mainspring barrel,” “plaster and debris”—grounds the fantastical device in mundane rubble.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: use his sight to heal the inter-dimensional rupture. Escalation is single but meaningful: the 4:17 silence narrows options to “act now or seal the cracks forever.” Agency is present—he raises the barrel, not luck. Felt price is the irreversible binding of his life to ghost-traffic maintenance; however, the cost is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal repair emerges: broken people and broken dimensions mend each other. Subtext operates through the mainspring’s double role—timekeeper and wound-healer—without authorial nudge. Final ticking image reweights prior “weightless burden” as purposeful tension. Avoids moralizing, but the concept edges close to thematic echo when Marcus narrates “calling not curse.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person past sustains elevator technician’s perceptual signature: vertical fixation, vibration metaphors, tool precision. Rhythm modulates from long clause chains (early observation) to staccato prepositional fragments at climax—“In that moment…”—mirroring heartbeat shift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs kept voice-motivated (“he knew this wasn’t ordinary…”) to frame tech expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: dust vial, mainspring lore, and ghost mechanics packed into single sentences without scaffold. Figurative control: “wisps of spiritual energy leaked like steam” stays physical and consistent. Minor loop: “weightless burden” phrase repeated thrice; pattern is taught early and reprised at closure, so waived as motif, not artifact. Closure line “answers…whispered from above” lands clean, no mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of elevator tech + ghost-seeing + horological portal feels non-obvious and specific to Marcus’s vertical obsession. Dust-pattern cartography as supernatural detection is a fresh procedural twist. Tropes (abandoned circus, ghost swarm) are transformed through mechanical repair lens. Risk—conceptual repair instead of exorcism—pays off in resonant image rather than spectacle.</comment>
