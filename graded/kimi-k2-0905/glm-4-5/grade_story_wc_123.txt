<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “credibly curious” label is repeated but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; his final decision to send the pigeon is rational, tidy, and cost-free. No interior contradiction plays out in real time—every beat is summary. The only embodied moment (trembling fingers) is instantly explained away, flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a declared decision, not a dramatized beat: the bird is released off-page after a static paragraph of summary. Causal chain is outline-level: “he would intuit the right moment” tells us timing instead of showing the trigger. No persistent constraint or price shapes the final image, so the Decisive Change lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Courtyard fountain, dusk light, and pigeon tube are sketched with selective sensory detail that stays inside Elias’s weather-recorder bias. Spatial choreography is coherent; the perimeter creep keeps threat present. Setting never actively constrains choice—no beat requires the fountain or dusk—so it decorates rather than charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—exposure of weather manipulation—but the single tightening beat is summarized, not dramatized: “he would broadcast the truth.” No live option is foreclosed on the page; the pigeon release happens after the scene ends. Pressure stays conceptual; cost remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrity-through-silence is stated repeatedly (“nurture integrity in solitude”) rather than emerged from dramatized conflict. Final image of the pigeon vanishing is pretty but does not reweight prior material; it simply repeats the opener in reverse. No ironic gap or ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays stable and filtered through a meteorologist’s perceptual lens—cloud, barometric dusk, silver feather. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors creeping caution. No dialogue to test distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and profession-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty. Occasional elevated phrasing (“layered tranquility that covered secrets both personal and political”) edges toward abstraction but does not clot momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Weather-manipulation conspiracy is familiar dystopia; freshness lies in the carrier-pigeon inversion—turning the regime’s own courier into its undoing. Yet the beat is summarized, not shown, muting the twist’s punch. Concept feels like a clever outline awaiting scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Present from first sentence, but “meticulous” never complicates any on-page choice; it is a static label. The final broadcast uses the same care he always shows—no escalated cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Tube is discovered, handled, reloaded, and released—four distinct beats. Its brass/wax texture reappears, and its final payload reverses its origin, reweighting meaning. Still, the release itself is off-stage, muting full payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Zone’s rogue status shapes the stakes—manufactured storms justify control—but no zone rule constrains Elias’s courtyard moves; it functions as off-page backdrop rather than immediate obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade>
<comment>“Credibly curious” is asserted four times yet never collides with risk; no beat shows him tempted to reckless inquiry or forced to curb it. Trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.5</grade>
<comment>“Intuit” is claimed twice but never dramatized—no sensory flash or deduction scene. The moment he senses surveillance is skipped; intuition is off-page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>“Progressing laterally” is named twice yet the only described move is a cautious perimeter walk; no lateral data-gathering or indirect tactic appears in scene. Phrase feels grafted on.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Courtyard supplies dusk cover and fountain masking-sound, enabling the tube retrieval. However, no beat requires those specific features; any shadowed nook would serve. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>“Followed home” creates an off-page clock that keeps Elias cautious, but elapsed time is vague; no dusk deadline or watcher shift forces the final release timing. Pressure is ambient.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Integrity motive is repeated but never tested by an on-page temptation—no offer to join, bribe, or silence. Solitude is default, not costly choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>“Layered tranquility” is evoked through fountain murmur and dusk hush, modulating to menace as shadows lengthen. Tone stays coherent yet does not charge the final image; the pigeon launch is calm, not ironically serene.</comment>
