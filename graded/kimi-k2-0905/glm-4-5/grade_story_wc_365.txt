<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The map-maker’s interiority is lyrically rendered, but the only on-page choice—reaching for the red shard and being repelled—remains reactive; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice alters tactics. Memory gaps and “determination” are stated, not dramatized, so the arc stalls at yearning. The withheld truth motive is clear early, yet the ending’s refusal costs nothing we can feel, keeping the change ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard dims, the door vanishes, and the map-maker vows to continue—cost is conceptual (spent power) rather than felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each timeline shard layers history-density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by 60 words; no因果 breaks. Yet the red-shard prohibition is the single tightening beat; another loop or irreversible loss would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dust motes, green glass warmth, and frozen tools create a tactile micro-setting that doubles as emotional barometer; the repair bay’s shifting incarnations constrain what the protagonist can attempt. Sensory selection skews visual, but glass temperature and murmur texture keep it multi-sensory. The final image of dim glass in slanted light recharges the opening, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover withheld truth—signals early and tightens once: the red-shard denial forecloses immediate answers. Pressure is accumulative: each timeline overlay increases existential density rather than external danger. A visible price (shard dims, power spent) lands, but because the protagonist neither sacrifices information nor risks bodily harm, the cost remains moderate; higher bands require a trade-off that hurts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of pursuing knowledge across infinite selves—knowledge that may erase the seeker. Subtext whispers through the glass’s refusal: some truths are protected from the self who craves them. No moral is stated; the dimming shard reconfigures the quest as potentially self-consuming. The lyric reprise avoids tidy profundity, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the map-maker’s perceptual filter: “fingers trembled,” “world dissolving into shimmering possibilities.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under heat-shock, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. The occasional elevated phrase—“architecture of existence”—feels earned by the character’s archival vocation, keeping distance coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with strong verbs—“fray,” “thrumming,” “receded”—carrying double duty. One paraphrase loop (“half-remembered dreams” echoed three times) and a filter-stack (“felt,” “sensed,” “seemed”) slightly dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors (“sailors reading invisible seas”) risk overwriting, but the final beat stays clean. Overall momentum survives the lyric surplus.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The parallel-worlds conceit is familiar, yet grounding it in a sensory cartographer who maps timelines like textures feels fresh. The abandoned spaceport as multiversal hinge, the glass as living compass, and the red-shard fail-safe synthesize tropes into a singular apparatus. Risk lies in the lyric mosaic structure; it pays off by making the reader feel the map-maker’s synesthetic disorientation. Not transformative, but specific enough to escape cliché.</comment>
