<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority stays concrete—her fingers test glass “with practiced fingers,” memory surfaces as tactile ritual—but the decisive shift from yearning to communal craft is skimmed; cost is asserted (“no longer felt weighed down”) rather than embodied in a moment of renunciation. Micro-choices are present (climb, collect, weigh, polish) yet none are staged as a crucible that forecloses the old dream; the pivot happens in summary. Still, her earthbound flaw complicates every beat, and the voice remains idiosyncratic enough to feel individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the grotto flips from private exile to public sanctuary, reweighting “earthbound” from curse to vantage point. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each glass shard adds density until the final projection reframes her life. Cost is legible in the single word “instead,” which trades star-voyage for stewardship, but the beat is compressed; the reader must supply the ache of the foregone launch. Causality holds; no plot amnesia; transitions are legible within one continuous scene.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto is kinesthetic—“twisted like a sleeping serpent”—and actively used nightly; sea glass is handled, weighed, polished, re-handled, evolving from souvenir to projector. Moisture, moonlight, and cliffside workshop constrain movement and furnish tools. Micro-setting (the body, the glass) literally enables the final star-projection, so the 9+ gate is met. Occasional filler phrases (“back in her small workshop”) stall momentum but do not white-room the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share starlight without fire—signals early and tightens through iterated glasswork; the tension is endurance vs. unattainable sky. One meaningful deepening occurs when telescope-view is surpassed by glass-refraction, narrowing options: she will never leave Earth yet now commands its sky. Cost is atmospheric rather than tangible—no blood, no coin—but the“pearl of stillness” scene makes the trade-off felt. Coincidence absent; escalation is accumulative; sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: illumination without destruction, patience over conquest. Subtext resides in the glass itself—trash tumbled into lens—suggesting beauty from incapacity. No overt thesis; final“zephyr bloom” risks symbolic echo yet lands as image, not moral. Complexity acknowledged: fire once“burned her dreams to ash,” so her purity is scar-informed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature favors haptics and light. Diction—“reflectively vibrant,”“zephyr bloom”—leans poetic but remains internally consistent, taught early and paid off in final projection. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.少数句式模板化（“she would...”）略拖节奏，未至Artifac级别。</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors occasionally collide:“pearl of stillness” as both sphere and emotional state; “zephyr bloom” is pretty but imprecise. Dense figurative runs in the stillness paragraph tip toward overwriting. Otherwise sentences vary, props track, verbs stay strong; no scaffold loops or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Earthbound astronomer using beach trash as planetarium is fresh; familial gem-polishing seed feels inherited yet specific. Risk taken with lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals, and coherence holds. Could swap names/places with minor loss, but the refractive sky-map is memorable enough.</comment>
