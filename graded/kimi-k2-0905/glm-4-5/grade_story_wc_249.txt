<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—her finger-drumming, window-ledge perch, and lagoon obsession are specific—but the “quiet rebellion” is declared more than dramatized after the escape beat; no micro-choice shows her risking new cost once Theo appears, so the renunciation feels assumed rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the lyrical pattern of drumming→visible sound→lagoon manifestation is taught early and pays off in a Conceptual Repricing (the garden becomes the dreamed lagoon). Orientation is anchored by word 60; cost is felt in the four-minute blackout window and the translucent, transient Theo, but the causal leap from “rhythm on railing” to full physical lagoon is lightly motivated—accept under lyric logic yet marginally thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its vibrating surfaces, visible ripples, and Resonance tower actively enable the climax by translating Elena’s drumming into the lagoon. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—auditory/kinesthetic first, visual second—mirroring her musician-twitch POV. Spatial choreography holds as she taps from cell→corridor→tower→water’s edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reunite with Theo—lands early; pressure escalates via the offline-system countdown and the garden’s rising response, but agency after the tower-drum is surrendered to setting magic; Elena’s final stance is crystallized (Charged Poise) yet the price is external (systems reboot) rather than a choice that forecloses a path, so the tightening is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without label: entanglement as quiet rebellion against scientific erasure. The lagoon’s re-materialization reweights the stake—memory made flesh—ending on “defiance and love” that avoids moral summary. Aurora sorrow modulates into fragile possibility, giving a resonant after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature centers on rhythm, metal vibration, and color-sound synesthesia. Prose is lush yet patterned—“universe inhaling,” “liquid light” recur with purpose. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; register remains poetic but consistent with her hyper-attentive sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Density is high—“notes becoming flowers of light” carries triple duty. One mixed metaphor stretch: “pregnant with potential that scientists had learned to capture” is abstract, not embodied, but does not touch closure. Read-aloud flow is musical, suiting subject.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Quantum-entangled lovers plus sonic biotech is familiar, yet the treatment flips the trope into lyric interiority; the garden-to-lagoon transformation is an inevitable image seeded by constant drumming. Risk in near-total reflection is justified by accumulative design and pays off. Specific sensory detail prevents generic feel even if plot bones are recognizable.</comment>
