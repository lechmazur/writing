<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The poet’s obsession with “the texture of time” is vivid and embodied in knot-making; interiority stays concrete. Yet no contradictory impulse ever collides with that drive—every micro-choice ratifies the same impulse—so the arc is additive, not conflicted. The final coil-and-departure is credible but costs nothing on the page; the rope neither snags nor forecloses a path. Interior texture is strong; dramatic tension is one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: starlight, pigment, and rope-fibres thicken into a single mandala-pattern that reweights perception. Closure is Charged Poise: the finished mandala holds all impossible choices visible at once, felt cost is the unchosen paths compressed in that image. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric design; no orientation debt. One tightening—knot completed—reconfigures meaning; meets short-form escalation rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls, frayed hemp fibres, and silver starlight are filtered through a poet’s tactile bias; every sensory pick serves the texture quest. Micro-setting (rope-body-grotto) constrains gesture—kneeling, looping, coiling—so environment shapes tactic. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible distances. Final image of coiled rope against warming wall satisfies 9+ test: setting charges the closing frame.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“map the new temporal feeling”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: pattern completion compresses all futures into one frozen mandala, foreclosing further mapping. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; reader feels the sacrifice of open possibility. Sufficient for 600-word scale but lacks a tangible price (rope unbroken, poet unbruised).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: time-as-landscape revealed by alien constellations. Subtext lives in rope-knots—each loop a foreclosed future—so theme stays implicit, image-driven. Final line reweights premise (“time…a landscape”) through concrete image of coiled rope. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers as spatial metaphor for temporal loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via starlight/knot diction; rhythmic refrain of “texture” and “pattern” holds. Perceptual signature is tactile, synesthetic: starlight “warm,” fibres “bearing tension.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Register stays poetic yet legible; comma-light syntax mirrors breath of night work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths shorten under knot-tying urgency. Figurative layer is dense (≈70% of sentences) but pattern-taught and paid off in final mandala image—density penalty waived. No synonym loops or template cadence; strong verbs (“traced,” “pulsed,” “rippled”) replace modifiers. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “seemed to” filters could compress, but do not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Premise—alien constellations trigger human rope-divination—is fresh yet plausible. Rope as temporal cartography is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk remains lyrical rather than plot-driven, but coherence stays high. Could swap poet for any seeker, so not fully irreplaceable; still, the constellation-grotto pairing feels singular.</comment>
