<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian’s weariness and residual idealism register in concrete gestures—scuffed shoes, thumb-polished wood—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible, costly micro-choice during the treaty beats; the personal stake (“war had stolen their family”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the climactic signature feels earned by synopsis rather than by on-page tension. The operative gentleness is asserted repeatedly but never forces a trade-off we can watch. Result: credible silhouette, not yet crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the empty clipboard left on the table crystallizes the cost—lifetime solitude traded for a fragile peace—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent: ritual steps, celestial alignment, and Elian’s practiced patience accumulate until the representatives sign. The midpoint orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props or outline drift. Enough for immediate publication, but the causal chain never tightens to a single irreversible beat that would lift it to 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ancient terrace, salt air, and tripartite suns are sketched with selective sensory economy; weather and stone guide pacing and mood without tourist clutter. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting: its weight, polish, and final absence constrain Elian’s gestures and charge the closing image. Environment never becomes a tactical obstacle, so it supports but does not shape the treaty terms; hence 7.8, not 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can ritual diplomacy overcome inherited hatred—signals early and tightens once: the midday breakthrough that forces the harder post-lunch land concessions. Pressure is textural, not causal: each ceremonial step adds density until signing feels inevitable. Visible cost is present—the clipboard’s relinquishment and Elian’s solitude—but the escalation is a single gentle slope, not a spike that forecloses options, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—peace as daily practice, redemption as perpetual debt—emerges through the clipboard’s journey and the final image of laughter echoing over stones still cracked. No moralizing summary; the bittersweet wine and rising moon reweight prior motifs. Complexity is honored: peace is “complete and incomplete,” a stance not a solution. The resonance is strong but not indelible; one more specific, contested concession on the page would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elian’s perceptual filter: celestial shadows, salt taste, trembling hands. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ritual steps, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice is consistent, textured, and purposeful; it lacks the final sonic punch that would mark 9-band distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and accurate. No scaffold loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“impossible beauty,” “eternal territories”) edges toward the generic but never muddies causality or blurs the closing image. A few syllables of compression would earn 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The forever-war diplomat with an ebony clipboard is fresh; the ritual treaty on a tri-sun terrace refracts familiar peace-process tropes through speculative light. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion rather than twist—but the synthesis feels specific and inevitable. Not quite breathtaking, but well above derivative.</comment>
