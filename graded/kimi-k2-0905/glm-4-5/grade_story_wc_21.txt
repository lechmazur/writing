<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ellara’s interiority is concrete—she traces diary spines, tastes tear-gas, fingers tremble—showing embodied contradiction under pressure. Her micro-choice to kneel and spell messages with debris crystallizes values; the cost (daily return to the lagoon) is visible. One slip: “searing reverie of human complexity” edges into label-speak, blunting peak emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts daily parley with the past, foreclosing a clean exit; grandfather’s new diary entry supplies undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each diary-opening tightens retrocognitive entrapment, therefore she seeks lagoon interface. One minor scaffold: “truth in tension” repeated thrice; does not break linkage but dulls final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Obsidian lagoon reappears as charged micro-setting: its black surface accepts then rearranges her debris-questions, literally constraining tactics. Zeppelin library supplies off-stage resource (diaries) without cluttering present space. Sensory hierarchy tight—salt-air sting, engine hum under oak—mirrors internal urgency. Spatial choreography clean: descent, kneel, water edge, sunset shift violet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—free herself from retrocognitive entrapment—signaled in first 50 words; escalation via seventh-diary mistake that forces time-travel. Lagoon parley provides single meaningful tightening: messages vanish, answers flood back, narrowing option to perpetual dialogue. Cost legible—she forfeits solitary archival safety for daily confrontation with ancestral pain. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves trap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme—history as living wound requiring active conversation—emerges through lagoon mirror and debris alphabet, never sermonized. Final image of sunset violet shift reweights earlier “obsidian” into mutable memory surface, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in grandfather’s new entry avoids tidy moral; ambiguity persists: progress still bleeds. Avoids thematic echo; no character states thesis aloud.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Voice carries archivist precision—encrypted spines, chromatic memories—without drifting into academic dryness. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under retrocognitive assault, then clipped “She reopened the seventh diary” for final beat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stable. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse”) softens immediacy but forgivable at this length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Information density high—each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent: lagoon as temporal mirror, debris as alphabet. Opening line anchors voice and mystery cleanly. Minor register drift: “Conceptual Repricing” is evaluator language, not character’s; isolated, does not propagate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Fusion of civil-rights archive, time-travel via encrypted diary, and lagoon-as-interface feels fresh synthesis rather than checklist. Risky accumulative structure—repeated “seventy-two hours later” etc.—paid off by final diary payoff. Specificity of black-water reflection pool differentiates from generic time-portal. Transformation test: swap elements, story collapses—proof of integration.</comment>
