<comment>Kaelen’s “warmly curious” nature is asserted more than embodied; only one micro-choice (offering to help) shows the trait altering tactics. Interiority drifts toward summary (“memories stirring”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. The final renunciation of exile is credible, yet the cost is generalized (“weight of exile lift”) rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or visible stain, so the change feels mildly under-earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sundial’s first shadow crystallizes Kaelen’s restored faith—an earned stasis with conceptual cost (his bird-offering seals the renunciation of diaspora). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each fragment he fits reweights his identity, so the lens holds. However, orientation is delayed: “who/where” anchors arrive only after ~140 words, slightly past the 120-word waiver line, and the disorientation does not later pay off at closure, so the −0.3 Orientation Test applies.</comment>

<comment>The catacomb orchard is sensuously specific—roots tightening around bones, morning light through canopy—and constrains the final image: tree roots literally embrace the sundial, mirroring Kaelen’s embrace of home. Selective sensory hierarchy (tactile bark, old tongue on lips) filters through Kaelen’s bias rather than tourist catalog. No spatial drift; choreography stays clean as he moves between graves and dig sites. The setting earns its 8+ by charging the closure image with undeniable metaphoric cost.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and tightens once: each fitted stone narrows his option to remain an observer, forcing embodied participation. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal; pattern break occurs when he speaks the old tongue aloud, a cadence shift that reweights the stake from nostalgia to audible commitment. Cost is legible yet soft—time and foreign dust rather than irreversible loss—so the tightening feels meaningful but not razor-sharp.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: return as cyclical repair of both artifact and self. The sundial’s bird-carving, seeded early, reappears as the final piece, reconfiguring “interrupted journeys” into completed souls. No overt moralizing; the last line lets light and shadow speak. Subtext in gesture—fingers tracing grooves, roots tightening—carries the ancestral communion without abstraction, giving the reader an evocative aftereffect that resists tidy summary.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays stable inside Kaelen’s perceptual filter; perceptual signature is concrete (“foreign dust still clinging to his boots,” “words dormant for decades now flowing”). Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences during reflection, clipped fragments when he sets the final stone. One line of dialogue from Elena is naturalistic and subtextual (“Your people always watched time differently”), advancing theme without info-dump. No register drift or filter-verb clutter; voice maintains texture under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (“grotesque yet beautiful dance,” “broken communion”) and both serve the tone of cautious enchantment without crowding. One paraphrase loop detected: “journey completed / path rediscovered” in adjacent sentences, a −0.2 loop penalty. No grammar slips; pronouns stay anchored. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, and free of scaffold.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing diaspora return with a catacomb orchard that grows through bones is a fresh synthesis; the sundial as both timepiece and soul-passage device feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—“small bird carved to represent souls in passage”—transforms the familiar homecoming trope into something memorable. The risk of lyrical accumulative structure pays off: the final shadow on the dial reweights all prior fragments. Could edge higher with a more visceral cost, but the angle is authentically envisioned and fully committed.</comment>
