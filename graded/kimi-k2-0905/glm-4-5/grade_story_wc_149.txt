<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s interiority is vividly rendered through her sensual yearning for soil and sunlight, but her contradictory impulses (duty vs. desire) are told rather than enacted in scene; the final dispersal of seeds is a single micro-choice that earns her release, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. No secondary character applies live pressure, so the “relationships as crucible” bullet is N/A; the debt motive remains abstract, so the endurance reads as serene rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mosaic structure (greenhouse present → backstory → field payoff) teaches its pattern early and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the bead’s dissolution reweights the premise, showing the debt paid and love transmuted into an impossible winter bloom. Causality is lyric rather than tight—beats accumulate texture until the final image crystallizes meaning—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently; orientation is clear by word 60. Cost is felt in the bride’s dissipation, though rendered as gentle release rather than acute loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass distortions, bioluminescent pollen, and perpetual frost function as micro-setting that constrains the ghost’s tether and charges the final bloom; the winter-cracked fields supply the necessary outside pressure that winter can still penetrate. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices soil warmth she cannot feel—and the spiral etching on the bead mirrors the bloom’s center, creating a taught pattern that reconfigures at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across the shard transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberation through repaying the alchemical debt—arrives early; escalation accrues by textured repetitions of winter vs. eternal orchard rather than causal turns. The single meaningful tightening is the bead’s midnight pulse that almost substantiates her; cost is conceptual (her fading) rather than a forfeited object or live option. Agency is renunciation rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the price feels soft because she yearns for dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love as alchemical transmutation that turns poison into bloom and debt into release. Subtext operates through the spiral motif (bead → bloom) that silently reweights meaning without thematic statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—winter bloom with spiral heart—avoiding moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether reunion is real or symbolic, which is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—glass distorts constellations, pollen is “lovingly venomous,” frost “dances”—and rhythmic control heightens toward the dissipation beat without overwriting. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are N/A. POV distance stays stable, filtered through the ghost’s attenuated senses; diction stays within her plausible lexicon of alchemical Gothic. Patterned repetition (“resonant awakenings”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean, with high information density; sentences weave sensory detail into action. Minor scaffold: “resonant awakenings” is reused four times without new pressure, creating a small loop; mixed metaphor “lovingly venomous pollen” is accepted as voice-driven. No artifacts obscure the closure image; final lines are crisp and image-based. Occasional elevated diction (“attuned celestial conditions”) fits the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The alchemical-wedding ghost-orchard fusion feels fresh, synthesizing familiar Gothic tropes through specific botanical-alchemy rules and a debt economy that spans death and rebirth. The spiral bead → bloom reconfiguration is an inevitable, non-obvious payoff. Risk in lyric mosaic structure heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Some phrasal echoes (winter-cracked fields, lovingly venomous) could approach template cadence, keeping it from the top band.</comment>
