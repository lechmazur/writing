<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s “emotionally rational” label is asserted but never embodied in contradictory micro-choices; she photographs, notes, and collects with scholarly calm, yet no bodily cost or irrational twitch complicates her stance. The ledger discovery is a windfall, not a decision that tests her limits, so the arc is flat. Interiority stays safely academic; no moment forces her to weigh complicity or endanger her reputation, so the promised flaw remains theoretical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: letter → station → ledger → truth exposed, each beat because/therefore. Closure lands with conceptual cost—truth will now spread—yet the price is social, not personal; Eleanor pays nothing on the page. The single-scene default is met, orientation is swift, and no reversals break logic, so the skeleton holds even if tension never spikes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ivy, broken glass, and carved initials are tactile and POV-filtered; the station’s decay mirrors obscured history without overt nudging. Architectural details constrain action—she must pry floorboards, crouch beneath arches—so setting actively enables discovery. Micro-setting (ledger under boards) directly supplies the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory range is narrow but purposive, keeping word-count lean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—justice for erased workers—but Eleanor faces no live opposition, ticking clock, or risk of loss; pressure is intellectual, not visceral. The single tightening is the ledger reveal, yet it widens, not narrows, her options. No trade-off is forced; she simply pockets evidence, so escalation is present but mild. Conceptual cost is real for the city, yet the protagonist’s personal cost is zero.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “noble lies” emerges through juxtaposed documents rather than sermon, culminating in the silent payoff of initials carved in stone. The ending image—ivy still growing—lets the idea resonate without moralizing. Ambiguity is modest: no exploration of whether revealing the lie might destabilize present communities, so complexity is partial. Subtext stays in the ledger’s numbers, not in Eleanor’s body or conscience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eleanor’s perceptual filter: she notices carvings, matches margins, feels “breakthrough” rather than triumph. Syntax is steady, Latinate, historian-appropriate; no drift into corporate or florid register. No dialogue means voice must carry all texture, which it largely does, though cadence is uniform. Distinctiveness is moderate—competent scholar diction without idiosyncratic spark.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—ivy “clawed” is the single personification—and does not clot the climax. Opening and closing lines frame the mission and its completion with economical symmetry. A few nominalizations (“historical narrative,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly dilute immediacy but never obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise is familiar—hidden ledger reveals capitalist atrocity—but the rose-petal timing and illuminated letter add folkloric specificity that freshens the formula. Risk is low; no formal experiment or moral inversion challenges reader expectations. The ivy-station metaphor is effective yet expected. Overall, a polished iteration rather than a transformative reinvention.</comment>
