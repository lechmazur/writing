<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—“breath catching,” “fingers trembled with cautious exuberance”—and her scholarly obsession is embodied in the tactile ritual with the ink well. Yet her contradictory impulses (caution vs. recklessness) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured micro-choice; we never see her risk a flawed translation in real time. The “carefully reckless” tag repeats without a visible moment where that tension snaps into a costly decision. Closure is Earned Stasis—she accepts the possibility of dismissal—so motivation holds, but the flaw/complication never actively compounds within the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers translated fragments until a ceremonial text breaks the pattern, tightening stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elena steps toward the chamber with “cautious exuberance” crystallized, cost felt in the near-empty ink well and the risk of irreversible division. Causality stays internal and lyric; no teleporting props. However, the archive’s spatial anchor arrives only at ~140 words, just past the 120-word orientation window, so a −0.3 orientation penalty applies, capping Q3 at 7.0 and Q1 at 8.3; the delay is minor but unnecessary for lyric payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: its dwindling ink tracks elapsed time and its glow mirrors Elena’s rising hope. Archive dust motes and dim light are filtered through her scholarly gaze, but broader geography (continent, era) is withheld—acceptable at this length. Spatial choreography is clean; the ink well stays within reach and its final near-emptiness charges the closure image. However, the environment never physically constrains her next move—doors never lock, candles never gutter—so the 9+ gate is not met; cap 8.8 remains intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop the treaties—signals early and tightens when the ceremonial text reveals mutual obligations. Escalation is incremental: each translated vow adds moral weight but no external obstacle raises physical cost; the only price is cognitive and emotional. Agency is internal—she keeps writing—yet no beat forces her to choose between fidelity and speed, so tension accumulates rather than pivots. Cost is conceptual (risk of disgrace) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: buried linguistic kinship challenges self-serving historical narratives. The “symphonies of truth” motif recurs but remains abstract—never re-weighted by a concrete sonic image—so it decorates rather than constrains. Subtext is present in the silence both sides cultivated, yet the final image withholds any communal reaction, leaving resonance in suspension. No moralizing sentence caps the piece, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s scholarly diction—“arcane linguist,” “latticework of relationships”—with rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence matching her hunt for harmony. No dialogue appears, avoiding voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied. A single POV drift—“the archive…held secrets that might heal wounds”—reads as authorial intrusion but is brief. Overall, the voice is distinctive and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is textured and compressed: “dust motes dancing in the afternoon light” does triple sensory work. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. However, a template cadence recurs: “The glass ink well…” opens three sentences across the piece; while pattern-teaching, the third iteration borders litany without fresh pressure. A few adjective clusters (“cautious exuberance,” “terrifying speed”) are stock pairings; they dull rather than sharpen. Closure beat is clean, so −0.3 for cadence repetition, −0.2 for stock intensifiers; total −0.5, yielding 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—translator vs. geopolitical divorce via lost vows—is fresh, avoiding stock quest or romance arcs. Linguistic reconciliation as peace-building tool feels non-obvious and specific. Risk is intellectual rather than action-based, fitting the accumulative lens. No close echoes of famous scenes; the ink well recurs but evolves, avoiding symbolic convenience. Transformation test fails only if the communities were swapped, but Elena’s scholarly specificity keeps it anchored.</comment>
