<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to understand the texture of time”—is stated repeatedly yet never dramatized as a visceral hunger; she decodes, embeds, and smiles, but no contradictory impulse or visible cost disturbs her arc. The urn fragment warms in her palm as if approving, a gift rather than a test, so her final “earned” stance feels foregiven, not fought for. Interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“time was hers to explore…a comfort, a guide, a friend”) that flattens tension instead of revealing new limits. The piece offers a serene Charged Poise, but the absence of flaw-driven friction keeps the change from feeling paid for.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale gloss adds density until the capsule’s ethos is re-stitched. Closure lands cleanly—“she would be ready to welcome them”—a Charged Poise that reconfigures her role from solitary reader to seed-scattering teacher; the cost is the unending vigil this guardianship implies. Tension tightens once when she grasps that linearity is a lie, but the beat is delivered in summary rather than scene, muting the pivot’s force. Orientation is swift and stakes remain stable; no因果 breaks intrude, yet the single intensification is mild for high-band ambition.</comment>

<comment>Emerald-veined walls that “pulse with temporal energy” and a capsule leaking “moments like water” give the silo a tactile, paradoxical body; the micro-setting doubles as clock and crucible. Garage-sale detritus—lamp, bicycle, kitchen scale—supplies nostalgic specificity that contrasts the alien chronology, anchoring theme without catalog bloat. Spatial logic is pristine: descent, base, staircase return, all tracked without drift. The final image of “shadows that seemed to bend in impossible ways” lets environment echo the newly bent rule-set, satisfying the 9+ constraint test even if the beat is brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can she decode the capsule and keep the knowledge alive?—is signaled early and deepened when she realizes messages hide in mundane adverts. Yet escalation is entirely internal and summary-driven; no external obstacle or ticking clock threatens failure, so the cost feels prospective rather than present. The only narrowing option is her decision to scatter new coded ads, a voluntary expansion, not a forced trade-off. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping the score below the 8.2 gate for high-band entries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges gracefully: meaning survives through the quotidian, and “time” is a weave community can re-knot. Subtext resides in the garage-sale idioms—human value persists in what capitalism discarded—yet the story avoids sermon. The ending image of welcoming future seekers invites ambiguity about whether this is hope or burden, satisfying the non-literal answer test. No moral is declared, but the insight never transcends the neat symmetry of the premise; complexity is present yet modest.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium, filtering world through synesthetic time-sense: walls “pulse,” urn “hums.” Syntax is supple, lightly lyrical, yet avoids purple overload; diction choices (“temporal anomaly,” “fractured chronology”) fit a scholarly intuition. Compression is purposeful—years of study pass in a clause—because the pattern is taught in the opening paragraph. Voice peaks in the garage-sale ciphers, where flat ad-copy collides with oracular brevity, creating texture that is both functional and musical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and openers; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—time as tapestry, messages as leaking water—without mixed-vehicle collisions. One clause (“the texture of time passing was no longer a mystery but a comfort, a guide, and a friend”) borders on sentimental list-making, but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image. Information density is high; every paragraph adds pattern or new artefact data, sustaining momentum across the compact span.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic time-keeper with junk-sale steganography feels fresh, not cribbed from familiar SF tropes. Turning mundane classifieds into oracles re-weights the pre-Reckoning world as deliberately cryptic, a reversal that grows organically from premise. The concept is fully committed to: no safety net of linear chronology is restored, and Elara embraces recursive guardianship. Risk level is moderate; the piece could push further into paradox or societal pushback, but within its lyric scope it avoids derivative safety.</comment>
