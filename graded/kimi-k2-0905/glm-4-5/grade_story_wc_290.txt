<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobia vs. hunger for open sky—are dramatized in bodily discomfort and the final step into boundless space. The “spatial mutiny” is her decision, not a label, and the cost is the familiar underground air she forfeits. Prudence surfaces only in the early tunnel caution; once the compass ignites, she risks paralysis and exile without hedging. Interiority stays concrete, though the lineage of the compass is briefly told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dormant magic period → compass activation → starlight threading → portal opens → she crosses. The portal’s appearance is a micro-turn, not luck, seeded by her humming that matches the fallow resonance. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she abandons her world, compass left glowing and useless behind. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only momentary fuzziness is the exact geography of the nexus, but spatial choreography recovers before the threshold step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cracked-ceiling starlight and viscous air are visceral, selective, and directly enable the star-threading mechanism. The compass as micro-setting constrains her grip and later her relinquishment. Sensory detail narrows to touch and sight under duress, matching claustrophobic attention. One minor slip: “ancient walls covered in faded runes” is static filler that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from subterranean imprisonment—is signaled early and tightened when the portal’s other-realm vista replaces the expected surface world, raising the cost of irreversible exile. The fallow period clock limits her window, forcing the humming risk while alarms stay asleep. Agency is hers: the hum, the pain-endured transfix, the step. No reversal, but the single deepening choice forecloses return, satisfying escalation under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of dimensional disobedience emerges through images rather than thesis: compass as inherited constraint, starlight as forbidden breach, portal as price of transcendence. Subtext resides in her grandfather’s tears—surface nostalgia becomes cultural memory that justifies treason. Final image of compass clattering reweights the object from key to spent shell. No moralizing, though “spatial mutiny” flirts with prompt-echo; the phrase is absorbed into voice quickly enough to duck full penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual quirks: air “viscous,” starlight “threaded,” sound remembered from “scratched recordings.” Syntax lengthens during portal awe, then fractures into short clauses under transfix pain, mirroring physiologic stress. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. The hymnal organ simile is vivid, not ornate, and pays off mechanically in resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “metal insect-like device hummed” does triple duty as object, motion, and sound. No scaffolding or synonym loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as thread, pain as barrier—without purple drift. Final line’s monosyllabic clatter delivers sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-against-sealed-world trope is re-angled through dimensional rather than vertical escape, and the compass mutates from map tool to star-looming catalyst. Claustrophobia-as-revolution-driver is personalized via grandfather’s colors, not generic fear. The two-moon vista refreshes the expected surface reveal. Risk in concept pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
