<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-propelled determination is clear, but the interior contradiction—her “confidently uncertain” stance—remains label-level until the final paragraph. The pen’s inherited power and her solitary ritual give her a concrete, idiosyncratic lens, yet her emotional texture thins in the mid-section where reflection outweighs micro-choice. The closing renunciation (“promise to the universe”) is earned, but the visible cost is only lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: wrong seed → guilt → contingent edit → Sarah’s correction, each step legible under the Causal lens. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 40, well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pen returned to its case reconfigures her role as perpetual gardener, not fixer, with conceptual cost felt in the final star-wink image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active mirror: twisted moonlight dances approval, distorted ribbons literalize her time-edits. The workshop’s chronopaper and quantum oscillators are handled, not catalogued, anchoring the speculative rule-set early. The pen itself functions as micro-setting—its swan-neck nib constrains the exact physical gesture of writing history, charging the final image when it glows and is laid away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—correcting her catastrophic mis-signal—tightens when she commits to the contingent-edit experiment. Agency is present: she composes the sentence, watches the glow, accepts the flutter of confidence/uncertainty. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she trades certainty for guardianship, foreclosing the option of grand rewrites. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scale; the reversal lands in Sarah’s off-page discovery, relayed as fait-accompli.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history as garden, not monument—tended, not owned. The refrain of “thresh meaning from experience” threads the error, the edit, and the final promise without overt moral. Subtext lives in the pen’s dried ink: absence as potency, limitation as ethic. Final star-wink reweights the premise, offering quiet acquiescence instead of triumph, avoiding sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric-philosophic, pitched to a solitary cosmic archivist who thinks in oscillators and ribbon-time. Syntax lengthens with reflection, then tightens into sentence-fragments under pen-stroke pressure (“Not command—suggestion”). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices star-blurs, cosmic murmurs, moonlight kinks. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; register stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety carries the reader across reflective and action beats without scaffold. Occasional elevated pairing (“terrifying yet welcoming”) edges toward template cadence but remains voice-motivated. Information density is high—each sentence layers task, memory, and world-rule. No mixed metaphors or loops; final paragraph avoids preachy uplift, landing on imagistic noun-phrase “strange comfort.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—time-editing pen—is refreshed by constraint: no ink, no erasure, only nudge via contingent relationships. The profession “celestial signal interpreter” is particularized through lived workshop detail and generational heirloom. Conceptual risk: quiet, reflective arc in a speculative frame, yet coherence never wavers. Specificity of swan-neck nib and chronopaper keeps the device from feeling interchangeable.</comment>
