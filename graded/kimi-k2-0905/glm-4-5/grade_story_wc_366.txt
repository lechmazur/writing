<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The interior contradiction between Elias’s reticence and his new hunger for connection is stated more than embodied; we never feel the cost in body or choice. His single micro-choice—adding one stone—reads as symbolic compliance rather than a stakes-driven decision that could have failed. The warmth in his eyes is asserted, not shown through biased noticing that would reveal character. Because the arc is interior and the external action is minimal, the absence of a visible, risky beat keeps the change informational.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the beam now “imbued with the presence of all who had tended it” reconfigures meaning and carries felt lineage-cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (glass, letters, stones) layers density until the final stack and letter tighten the stake. The piece never teaches the stone-code pattern early, so the ending’s weight leans on prior sentiment rather than a taught rule-set; this is acceptably paid off by the final line. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Salt-oil-“pause between thunderclaps” is selective synesthesia that filters through Elias’s professional priorities. The locked lantern room functions as micro-setting: its trapped vibrations make the impossible stone-stack credible and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral climb, floorboard lift, and stone placement. Weather and tool details (oil reservoir, lens) are accurate and tied to maintenance action, never tour-list.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lonely guardian versus need for continuity—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through artifact discovery (glass → letters → stones), each layering existential choice: keep or break the chain. The final stacking is a visible, irreversible act that forecloses anonymity. Cost is present but gentle; the story never risks tangible loss (job, safety, reputation), so escalation is emotional rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent kinship emerges organically from the concrete relay of stones and letters; no character moralizes. The returning sea-glass and stacked stones re-weight meaning at the end without symbolic overstatement. Ambiguity remains: the haunt is memory, not verdict—inviting reflection. Final image of “stones stacked just right” gives non-literal answer to how isolation is survived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s perceptual bias: “something like the pause between thunderclaps” is idiosyncratic, not catalog description. Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, shortens during lamp failure, mirroring attention. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly bounded. Free-indirect texture (“the luminescent ache of loneliness”) risks poetic overload but remains anchored in his moment of decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences advance atmosphere and insight simultaneously. Occasional modifier stacks (“jade green and polished by the endless tides”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “protect its silence just as he protected the light” restates prior clause without new pressure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper chain via stone cipher feels fresh; it reframes a familiar isolation trope into tangible relay. No pop-culture echoes; specificity of maritime maintenance grounds the concept. Risk is moderate—quiet accumulative structure rather than twist—but coherence is high. Transformation test fails: names/places could swap without breaking arc, keeping score sub-8.5.</comment>
