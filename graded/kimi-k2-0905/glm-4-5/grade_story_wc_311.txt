<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reaper’s grief is embodied in tactile handling of cloak, atlas, mechanism; naming ritual shows micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—“voice like dry leaves”—avoiding label-speak. No contradictory impulses in scene; shift from collector to namer is declared not dramatized, so cost feels moderate. Earned stasis lands, but earlier love-loss is told summary, flattening peak motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: naming “Solitude” crystallizes stance with visible weight-loss of cloak. Accumulative lens holds—each naming beat thickens pattern until moonlight final image reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by 80 words; single transition inside observatory keeps causality clean. No teleporting props; atlas flip at breeze supplies new map without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory brass mechanism, cracked lens, and scattered light prisms constrain the naming ritual—each beam must hit page for magic to work. Dust motes, dusk angle, and echo acoustics filter through reaper’s bone-perception, keeping detail selective. Micro-setting of atlas page doubles as setting object, charging final crystallization. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ease centuries-old grief via naming—signaled early. Pressure tightens when each named fear settles the drawing, foreclosing option to remain paralyzed. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than external battle; cost is legible in lightened cloak. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative deepening, sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges: naming shapes dread into bearable memory. Subtext lives in atlas reversal—sea monsters become star map—showing transformation without stating thesis. Final image of “Elara’s Eyes” stars reweights prior love-loss into quiet purpose. No moralizing; resonance carried by concrete light shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside reaper’s skeletal perception—dry-leaf voice, bone finger, weight of cloak. Syntax lengthens during naming, then shortens at release, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; diction remains archaic-tinged without caricature. Scattered-light metaphor is repeated but pattern-taught early, so reads as motif, not loop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length; opening compound clause vs final short “Well done.” Figurative language clustered in naming beats but serves pattern, not density overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Strong verbs—“pooled,” “fluttered,” “crystallize”—propel without excess modifiers. Clean grammar, consistent tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: reaper as anti-taxonomist giving names to erase fear, not wield it. Atlas page sea monsters flipped to star realms repurposes sailor lore into after-life cartography. Risk taken with static, solitary scene pays off via accumulative light ritual. Could swap reaper for generic immortal, so freshness capped below 9.</comment>
