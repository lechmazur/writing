<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is evocative (“frostbitten hope,” “cosmic joke”) but stays in lyrical summary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The shift from academic bitterness to witness is declared, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs them something on the page. The arrowhead warms, but Aris never acts on that cue in a way that forecloses the old goal—capture/dissection—so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical CR—“cultivate the frostbitten hope”—but the cost is abstract; no prior tactic is renounced on-page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of witness accumulates until stance crystallizes. Causality stays loose: the arrowhead’s warmth and phone music echo but do not force a final decision, so the ending feels poised rather than decisively changed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Underground garden is vividly textured: moon-petal flowers, upside-down gremlins, star-vine watered by hand. Selective sensory focus (scent of frostbitten hope, gravitational play) mirrors Aris’s shifting awe. The flint arrowhead’s evolving luminescence tracks environmental rules without exposition dump, charging the final constellation image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness vs. capture—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page opportunity to betray the cryptids. Pressure tightens only texturally: accumulating beauty and phone static. No decisive beat narrows options or exacts a visible price, so escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of “harmony untamed” emerges through images of predation/symbiosis and Aris’s relinquishment of control. Subtext is strongest when the arrowhead’s human craft contrasts with the garden’s organic intelligence. Final line risks overt statement (“cosmic joke nature had played”), slightly diluting resonance, but the idea is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual signature: scientific diction filtered through wonder (“taxonomies,” “bioluminescent mushrooms”). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for awe, clipped fragments for static calls—without losing clarity. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative layering serves awe rather than stalls. Minor loop: “metamorphose” and “transformations” repeat within two sentences; “frostbitten hope” appears three times, risking motif fatigue. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffold clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid ecology as underground permaculture, evolution tied to lunar eclipse, researcher turned witness via arrowhead starglow. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off; concept feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Could edge higher with a sharper on-page renunciation.</comment>
