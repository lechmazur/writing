<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s motivation—“to find the place where stories begin”—is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a pressured choice. Interiority is atmospheric (“they finally understood…”) rather than embodied or contradictory. The closing beat of “welcoming” the first customer is a gentle action but does not foreclose a path or exact visible cost. No micro-choice under tension shows why this matters more than the parole ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the vendor realizes stories begin in absence, not place. Cost is conceptual—emptiness reframed as origin—felt via the charged final image of bottled moonlight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of bottled phases → memory shards → blank slate accumulates to the reweighting. Causality is soft (ritual rules are asserted, not tested), but the ending retroactively justifies the drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass orchard, floating library, bottled moonlight—details are vivid, selective, and filtered through the vendor’s cataloguing gaze. The micro-setting (the blank slate in hand) literally becomes the door, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. One minor slip: “swirling sea of clouds” stays postcard until the library shift tremor ties it to visitor denial, but this arrives late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is existential: can the vendor locate the origin of stories before parole ends? Pressure is ambient—ritual renewal, possible visitor breach—rather than tightening. No beat narrows options or exacts a tangible price; the door-making ritual succeeds without obstacle. Escalation is poetic accumulation, not risk, fitting the lyric lens but keeping stakes abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: absence as generative space, stories born from what’s unsaid. The refrain of “quantifying absence” ripens into the closing realization without sermoning. Motifs (bottled moonlight, blank slate, memory shards) recur with shifting weight, culminating in the door-image that reframes emptiness as portal. Complexity is honored—no moral is declared, only an image that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with syntactic cadence that mirrors cataloguing reverence (“bottle after bottle…”). Diction stays within the vendor’s arcane lexicon; no register drift. One filter-verb cluster (“they began tracing… they finally understood…”) slightly dulls immediacy at the crest. Otherwise rhythm breathes with the lull-then-door beat, and perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: selective metaphors, no mixed vehicles. Two adjacent sentences repeat “vendor finally understood” concept, a micro-loop that slows the closure beat. Otherwise density is high—each sentence layers image or rule. Read-aloud rhythm varies, paragraph cuts purposeful. Artifacts minor; none obscure causality or dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The moonlight-as-absence metric, glass orchard library, and parole storytelling ritual synthesize into a fresh conceptual constellation. The reversal—that stories begin in emptiness—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Familiar fantasy tropes (floating shop, memory shards) are re-cast through rigorous theme. Risk in lyric structure pays off when the blank slate literally becomes doorway, not metaphor.</comment>
