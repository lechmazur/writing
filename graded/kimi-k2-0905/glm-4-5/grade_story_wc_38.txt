<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “calm defiance” is repeatedly asserted rather than dramatized; her only micro-choice is to finish the dance sequence, which succeeds at once without visible cost or contradiction. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she had learned that…”) instead of embodied tension. Still, the dancing-as-decryption premise is individual and the ending renunciation (dice dropped) carries faint cost, meeting the low bar for earned change at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: the screens ignite and knowledge is “liberated,” a Decisive Change. Yet causality is soft—why dice-as-RNG or dance-as-password works is never grounded; the journal “dance instructions” arrive only in the final paragraph as retroactive permission. The Orientation Test is waived because the dim-sunken frame is stable, but the how/why gap keeps the lens Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Cost is conceptual (previous world order upended) but not felt by Elara on the page, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The sunken lab is evocatively anchored—coral-encrusted corners, dripping pipes, filtered sunlight—each detail filtered through Elara’s practiced body. Spatial choreography stays clean as she dances among consoles. The hangman’s dice function as micro-setting, warming in palm and charging the final release; this object-as-setting meets the 9+ gate but the world rules (how dance maps to code) remain vague, preventing higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the lab’s core—is clear early. Pressure is atmospheric (lonely decay) rather than tactical; no deadline or antagonist narrows options. The single meaningful tightening is the final dance, but it succeeds immediately without trade-off or visible price. Escalation is therefore textural (density of images) not causal, satisfying Accumulative lens but capping the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—vulnerability encrypted into strength—emerges through the dice reclamation and dance decryption rather than overt statement. Final image of dice resting on console reweights the object from doom to tool, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Subtext is thin: Lydia’s question invites but never receives a dialogic challenge, so theme stays monologic. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, yet the insight feels pre-articulated rather than discovered in struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric sustains a consistent underwater cadence—long vowels, liquid consonants—mirroring oceanic setting. Filter verbs appear but stay purposeful (“seemed to hum”) rather than diluting immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction occasionally drifts poetic (“lyrical code breaker”) yet remains anchored to Elara’s perception. Rhythm modulates with the dance sequence, showing pressure-responsive control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length variation; information often dual-purpose (“obsidian cubes etched with symbols of fate” reveals object + mythic tone). However, metaphor density is high throughout (“spider spins its web” repeated thrice) without pattern payoff, triggering −0.3. Near-paraphrase loops (“mysterious familiarity” echoed four times) dull the closure image, applying the −0.4 template-cadence penalty. No grammatical slips, but over-decoration keeps score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dance-as-algorithm and dice-as-RNG convert carnival-gothic props into oceanic-scientific method, a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once declared. The “sunken dance decrypts paranoiac journal” premise is non-obvious and fully committed to. Transformation test passes: swap dice or dance and the entire mechanism collapses. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal—but coherence holds, justifying a positive within-band nudge.</comment>
