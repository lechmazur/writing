<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“trembling hands,” “salt crystals seemed to hum”—but the brother’s erased memory is told, not dramatized; her final stance change is soft, more comfort than cost. The micro-choices (swirling coffee, pressing wildflower) are specific, yet the stakes plateau once the crystal is found. Earned, but not pushed to the limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: re-burying the crystal with a flower makes the memory archive’s existence undeniable and forecloses retrieval—“visit, not remove” crystallizes cost. Causal chain intact: whale → gravity spikes → dig → crystal → recognition. Occasional paraphrase loops (“gleaming silence” reused) dull the final cadence a hair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Selective, urgent sensory filtering—“salt crystal facets catching lantern light”—anchors every move; the lighthouse chamber and tidal sand constrain shovel angle and visibility. The whale corpse functions as micro-setting, dictating where she can dig. Final image re-uses lantern-light on buried crystal, recharging the visual motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to deleted memories—broadcast early and tightened when gravity spikes bar authorities; her choice to dig rather than report is the single meaningful turn. No visible price is extracted after the find; tension plateaus. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “deleted memory as environmental sediment” emerges through salt, gravity, and oceanic time; no explicit moralizing. Subtext of sibling love is implied in her tears and ritual returns, not stated. Final re-burial offers open-ended resonance: memory stays communal, not owned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature—“geometric crystals climbed like frozen light”—matches her instrument-tuned gaze. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for dusk calm, staccato for shovel resistance. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction and succeeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence delivers salt, gravity, neurons. Mixed-metaphor risk in “neural pathways” vs “folding dimensions” passes because pattern is taught early. Minor template cadence—“she...she...she...” in paragraph 4—does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of marine-biology grief with geophysics grief archive feels non-obvious; salt-crystal memory vault is fresh image. Risk of sentimental whale trope is offset by procedural dig and scientific instrumentation. Transformation test: swap whale for elephant and premise collapses—salt crystal archive is site-specific. Could push further into ethical ambiguity of trespass, but stays within tight word count.</comment>
