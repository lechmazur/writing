<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—tactile reading of the screw, the felt absence of scent—but her shift to “warmth” at the end is asserted, not embodied. The midwife trainee is sketched more by role than contradiction. Micro-choices (returning the screw, waving Lena in) align with her new vocation, yet no real cost or foreclosed path is dramatized; the emotional beat feels softly resolved rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single scene, causal lens: loss of smell → clock repair → screw left → recognition → bridge built. Orientation is clean by word 80; fog and drips anchor time. Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s heart “lighter”—but the cost is only stated, not shown; no option is visibly foreclosed, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shop, fog, and dripping clocks create a tactile micro-setting; water droplets replace scent as temporal heartbeat. Spatial choreography is tight—workbench, brass handle, pocket—anchoring every gesture. The screw as micro-setting constrains the final handshake and is charged by closure; satisfies 9- gate but not quite indispensable to tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Dominant stake: regaining meaningful connection after sensory loss. Pressure is low-grade—Lena’s anxiety supplies mirrored stakes rather than escalating Elara’s risk. One soft tightening occurs when Elara realizes the screw’s history, but no trade-off or visible price follows; coincidence (Lena returns) merely comforts rather than complicates. Escalation stays flat under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary miracles” emerges through objects—screw, clocks—rather than exposition. The screw’s re-weighting at closure offers quiet resonance. Subtext in dialogue (“You can tell?” / “I’ve learned to see…”) is modest but effective. Final warmth drifts toward sentimentality; complexity caps at 7.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s tactile perception; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her measured craft—calm, precise, slightly scented in memory. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Lena’s trembling calm comes through in whisper and pocket-pat. No register drift; water-drip cadence sustains voice without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences often twin sensory and emotional work (“fingers… mapping emotional terrain”). Few filter verbs; metaphors stay consistent. Minor scaffold: “water clocks continued their steady drip” repeats near opening and closing; minimal drag. No artifacts touch closure; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory-loss aromatherapist is fresh; midwife screw as talisman less so, yet pairing births/timepieces creates quiet ingenuity. Transformation test passes: scent-to-drip symbolism is specific to this voice. Risk level is moderate; concept stays modest, avoids gimmickry but also avoids deeper ethical or sensory surprise.</comment>
