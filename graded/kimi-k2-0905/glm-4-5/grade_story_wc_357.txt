<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arion’s interiority is thin: we get “dread and wonder” but no contradiction or bodily detail. The arrow-tip growth power arrives as convenient exposition, not a tested limit. Still, his lineage link to the seed-fragment gives a credible, felt cost at the end—he alone can carry the knowledge home—so the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is intact: inversion → river-road → echoes → arrow payoff → reset. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “whirling silence” flips to “familiar sounds,” imprinting wisdom with visible cost—he must now act as steward. One soft patch: the echoes’ content is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting cost clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and inverted rivers are rendered through sensory motion—latticed shadows, silver serpents—anchoring navigation stakes. The arrow-tip doubles as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only the “orchard planet” macro-setting stays postcard-level, but the river-road and crystal-embedded First Arch charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find resilience source—tightens when the arrow’s glow forces a live decision: risk deeper arch pass or retreat. Agency is continuous: each river switch, root-thickening, and echo vision narrows options. Cost is legible: he emerges with irreversible knowledge and the burden to re-engineer agriculture. No external antagonist needed; gravity itself supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive resilience emerges through images of inversion and accelerated growth, never sermonized. Final smile is earned—he has absorbed the echoes’ agricultural blueprint—yet avoids tidy moral. One near-miss: the phrase “secrets of adaptation and survival” edges toward thematic echo; it’s brief enough to escape heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Close-third stays locked to Arion with perceptual signature—“sky-ship,” “Silvergard River”—and rhythmic compression under inversion stress. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect clean. Final cadence shift from “whirling silence” to “breathing easier” mirrors gravity reset, a deliberate modulation that charges closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive—“rivers tore free…silver serpents.” One paraphrase loop: “latticed shadows across the endless orchards” echoes prior “latticed shadows” two sentences earlier. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. Clean grammar, varied syntax, strong paragraph cuts.</comment>

<comment>Gravity-inverting orchard planet with aerial river navigation is a fresh synthesis of biopunk and geo-fantasy. The arrow-tip as relic of proto-terraforming tech transforms a stock talisman into evolutionary catalyst. Risk—lyric summarization of echoes—pays off by reweighting the premise rather than staging dialogue with ghosts. Specificity of “Silvergard River” and “First Arch” anchors the concept indelibly.</comment>
