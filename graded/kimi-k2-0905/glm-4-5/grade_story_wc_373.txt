<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eliza’s “curiously steadfast” trait is dramatized through the odd, non-economic goal of recording betrayal-sound; her micro-choices (false rumors, escalating lies) flow from that motive. Interiority is concrete—she gauges panic in others’ shuffles and knife-hands—but the emotional contradiction promised by “curious” vs. “steadfast” is only asserted, never felt as inner split or cost. The heirloom’s recording power is accepted without skepticism, so the flaw is less struggle than uncanny competence. Still, her decisions alone drive every beat, meeting the 9+ threshold for agency if not for visible self-cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each lie is a because/therefore trigger that moves Malachi toward exposing his lieutenant. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the watch now contains a “silence that screams,” reweighting Eliza’s odd collection and paying the premise’s cost. The single-scene orientation is anchored by word 60 (“beneath the rotting pier”) so no penalty applies. The only drag is a faint script-like feel to the rumor planting (“Word is…”)—minor but keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pier market is sketched with selective sensory economy: creaking wood, hushed negotiations, barrels of rum. These details double as social map—proximity to Malachi’s coin-counting back room dictates risk—so environment steers tactic. The watch fob serves as micro-setting whose gear-clicks mesh with surrounding whispers, constraining her timing for the final lie. No 9+ because weather and salt-air are generic; still, the marketplace is lived-in and spatially trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake is legible by line 5: break the truce, harvest betrayal-sound. Escalation is one-directional: each false rumor tightens Malachi’s paranoia until he self-exposes. Sunrise supplies an off-stage deadline but is never allowed to compress her choices in-scene; cost is paid by the pirates, not Eliza, so pressure is vicarious. Still, her agency propels every turn, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust as audible, collectible fragility—emerges through the watch’s final hum rather than explanation. The image of “silence that screams” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in the muttered rumors carries more weight than the显性 dialogue, keeping exposition low. A sliver off top-band because the emotional after-effect is cerebral more than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Eliza’s perceptual filter: she clocks “suspicion in his step,” hears gears “clicking in harmony with whispers.” Syntax tightens under pressure—clauses shorten as sunrise nears. Dialogue is minimal but pirate-talk avoids caricature. No head-hopping; voice is consistent, rhythmic, and character-specific enough for 8.5.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“trust shattered like dropped glass”) are clean, singular, and earned. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. A few adjectival boosts (“notorious,” “curiously steadfast”) verge on label but occur early and do not recur at climax, so only hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sonic-collection premise is genuinely fresh; no genre template matches capturing betrayal as recordable frequency. Pirate market + moonshine lineage could slide toward trope, yet the mash-up serves the odd concept rather than ornament. The watch’s reprise at closure makes the idea feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but successful—enough for high-band entry.</comment>
