<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is palpable via sleepless nights and charts, yet the interior contradiction—cautiously hopeful addict to proof—never collides in a single visible micro-choice under pressure; her final “wan smile” is the first embodied cost we see, so the decisive turn feels reported rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: charts → pattern → subsonic build → silence; silence is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (cosmic war declared). One scaffold loop—"community divides grew deeper each day" appears twice without new information—clips perfect clarity, but closure lands intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Radio-station micro-setting is concrete—vintage dials, antenna, blue pulse—yet campus outside stays a vague “town” without proximity or social texture that could tighten stakes. The station tools constrain action (circuit mods risk rupture), satisfying 9+ gate, but wider geography is sketched not lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate human perception—tightens exactly once: silence arrives, option “do nothing” foreclosed. Cost is cosmic-attention risk, felt conceptually but not concretely on her body or gear after the pulse; hence escalation strong but not viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unseen manipulation emerges from charts and back-channel whispers, never sermonized. Final silence reweights earlier “enlightenment” papers as complicity, producing resonant irony; ambiguity stays—tricksters may return—so moral avoids tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent celestial-interpreter perceptual signature—“subsonic realm,” “cosmic alignments”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hop; academic diction stays within Elara’s lexicon; final static-charge image crystallizes voice without filter-verb drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><grade>Prose breathes with sentence variety; tactile verbs (“traced,” “hummed,” “prickled”) carry density. One paraphrase loop on “community divides” and a single mixed metaphor—“antenna reached toward the heavens with invisible fingers”—slight dings, but artifacts never touch closure beat.</grade>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Alien conquest-by-division via astrological chart pattern is fresh synthesis; stock tropes (midnight countdown, blue pulse) are repurposed through Elara’s specialist lens. Risky subsonic method feels specific to radio-tech lore, though “cosmic tricksters” phrase flirts with cliché.</comment>
