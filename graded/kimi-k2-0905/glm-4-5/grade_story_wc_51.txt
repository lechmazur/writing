<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>A single, passive POV whose only “choice” is to endure calcifying their own burden; all other burdens arrive pre-packaged. Interiority drifts into self-mythologizing (“fractal within fractal”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship crucible, no secondary pressure, no micro-choice that alters later tactics. The ending’s “gift” is asserted, not dramatized through visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: burdens accrue, calcify, and are recorded. Closure lands as a Charged-Poise reconfiguration—boundary-lessly trapped rereads as boundary-lessly connected. However, the price is conceptual, not felt; no on-page constraint persists. The final beat lacks a concrete image that reweights the rule-set, so cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight patch are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered. The lamp burner reappears to bracket descent/ascent, earning micro-setting status. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment never actively constrains choice—no collapsing tunnel, no fuel shortage—so falls just short of 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared abstractly (“collect the weights of different burdens”) but never tighten; first burden is light, last is ancient, none alter tactics. No resource depletes, no option forecloses, no visible price is paid. The single “tightening” is the weaver’s self-burden, yet it is handled in the same beat as the others. Under Accumulative lens, density rises but pressure plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of bearing/witnessing emerges organically from calcification ritual; no explicit moralizing. The final reframe—trapped → connected—offers resonant ambiguity. Whalebone ledger, shingled hush, and starlight function as returning motifs that shift meaning. Yet the insight stays cerebral; emotional aftereffect is muted because cost stays off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and internally coherent: “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie,” “boundary-lessly trapped” read as signature diction rather than ornament. Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing; longer sentences during calcification, clipped fragments at entry/exit. Perceptual signature is consistent—metallic, mineral, luminous. No dialogue to test distance control; internal lexicon stays within poetic license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence and varied sentence openings. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (geological/star/weight imagery) and taught early. Occasional near-loops: “boundary-lessly trapped” repeats three times without new inflection; “shingled hush” layers atop “layers of silence.” No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Minor scaffold: “the weaver knew… they shook their head” could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of calcifying emotional mass into geology feels fresh, executed with mineral specificity. Ritual structure borrows mythic tropes but filters them through fractal/quantum diction, avoiding generic fantasy glaze. Final reframe—witnessing as gift—flips exile trope without sentimentality. Risk in lyric density pays off; closure image still legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
