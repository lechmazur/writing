<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—mourning his wife, ruined career, and stadium past while fondling a scrap of cloth—collides in the trailer, so his micro-choices (magnifier, sealing bag) earn a quiet renunciation with cost. The “confidently uncertain” credo activates in scene, not summary. Secondary pressure is thin (foreman’s shrug is light), but the single-POV default holds. Closure renunciation is credible, though emotional amplitude could push further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: cloth handled → memories accumulate → cadence shifts to authentication act; closure lands via Charged Poise (sealed bag, reclaimed passion) with conceptual cost that reweights his hollow life. Orientation anchor hits by line 4; no causality gaps. One transition (foreman entry) is legible, but escalation is textural deepening, not causal chain—permitted under lens. Closure image (“this was what remained”) is on-page and resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer, dust, slow trucks, failing A/C, and micro-tool (magnifier) constrain attention and echo interior hollowing; final image of sealed scrap is recharged by setting’s grit. Sensory hierarchy filters through ex-roadie bias—sound memory, aluminum thread knowledge, dumpster relics. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room risk. Weather detail minimal but suffices for single-scene scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Marcus reignite purpose without applause? Pressure accrues through cloth-induced memory barrage; meaningful tightening when he chooses authentication act (seals bag), foreclosing nostalgic drift. Cost is conceptual—he accepts “close to nothing” value yet gains self-reclaiming meaning. No antagonist needed; situational pressure of emptiness versus micro-act suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges: value is audience-relative; residue of lost glory can still oxygenate a hollowed life. Emerges via cloth journey, not statement—avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will spark sustain? That unansweredness is earned, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person free indirect hugs Marcus’s musician-appraiser diction: “thread count… early ’70s British amplifiers,” “echo valley longing.” Rhythm breathes—long memory coils, then clipped authentication note. No head-hop; distance stable. Perceptual signature sharp: he sees grille pattern, hears phantom crowd, feels aluminum cost-cut betrayal. Filter verbs sparse and motivated. Dialogue with foreman carries subtext of value vs. worth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence cadence; high info density without clutter. Only minor loop risk: “after the applause, after the dust settled, after all the losses” – deliberate anaphora, paid off, so waived. Metaphors (“hollowed out like the abandoned quarry”) stay consistent. No register drift. Clean copy; pronouns track. Final line lands crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—ruined appraiser in quarry decoding scrap—feels fresh against mid-life-loss trope. Specific amplifier lore and dumpster relic memory personalize stakes. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks. Could edge higher if cloth reprise had sharper twist, yet synthesis of quarry hollowing + amp fabric echo feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
