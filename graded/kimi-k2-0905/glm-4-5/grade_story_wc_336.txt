<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pruner’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet abstract; her “insatiably creative” trait is announced rather than dramatized in a concrete contradiction. She makes only one true micro-choice—surrendering to wonder while weaving—so the cost feels aesthetic, not personal. Earned stasis is present but muted: she “gives pieces of herself” yet we neither see nor feel what is lost. Voice remains consistent; however, the absence of tangible flaw or relationship pressure keeps her just shy of full-bodied credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions (“verdant parapet,” “radiant hush”) tighten mood until a Conceptual Repricing lands in the rainbow-casting seed. Closure is legible: the waterfall-softened hush crystallizes a charged poise where wonder is banked for future harvest, and the pruner’s exhaustion/surrender supplies felt cost. Orientation is complete by line 5; transitions are unnecessary in this single-scene design. One persistent constraint—her life-force invested—shapes the final image, satisfying high-band criteria.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Waterfall, parapet, and moss function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual stance; mist and rainbow re-weight the final image. Sensory triangulation is deliberate—sound of falls, shimmer of seed, press of moss under knees—never catalogued, always filtered through the pruner’s painterly eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible props. The seed’s evolving optics supply the required “tool that charges closure,” clearing 9-entry gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and re-appears as mantra; pressure tightens when surrender is framed as necessary cost. Single meaningful turn: capturing waterfall essence → knitting it into seed; this deepens rather than reverses, coherent with Accumulative lens. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical; no option is foreclosed except her stamina. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a visceral trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif cluster: seed / light / spectrum = transience captured; no moral statement intrudes. Grandmother aphorism could flirt with “thematic echo,” yet it is brief, early, and immediately embodied in ritual. Final rainbow re-prices prior “color” motif without explicit gloss. Ambiguity lingers: will future humans taste or merely see wonder?—invites rather than answers, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence; syntactic parallelism (“between worlds,” “between thumb and forefinger”) teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure. Diction is elevated yet consistent with mythic mode—“verdant parapet,” “canvas only artists of essence can paint”—no register drift. Perceptual signature is painterly-chromatic; no head-hopping. Under extreme pressure the prose compresses to fragments (“Threads of blue-white light…”) without clarity loss, meeting 9-band bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm employs anaphora and polysyndeton to mimic water’s pulse; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—water as time, seed as prism—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense lines carry double duty: “rushing water seemed to quiet” marries action and metaphor. Minor scaffold: “the pruner began her method by capturing essence…” (slight loop) but it precedes the final third, so 9+ is not disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar trope—elder mage performing soul-craft—is refreshed by botanical optics and chromatic science rather than fire/ice magic. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, yet coherence justifies the choice. Seed-as-prism and waterfall-as-pigment are specific, not generic. Could swap granny and location with minor edits, so not indispensable, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
