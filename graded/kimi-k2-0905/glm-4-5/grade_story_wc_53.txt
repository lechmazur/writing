<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cyrus’s regret-fuelled obsession is vivid and embodied in the scavenging, but his contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in scene. The camera-wheel choice is the only micro-action that truly reveals hierarchy-of-values; the ghost negotiation is prepared but still feels like summoned plot magic. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak (“profoundly chronologically confused”). The final merger is earned, pays visible cost, and reconciles flaw, so the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: celestial debris, overheard shards and camera fragments build toward Charged Poise at the ghost merger. Orientation is clear by line 4; causality is looser but coherent under lyric accumulation. Closure—wheel dissolving into light while carousel restarts—reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost. One causality bump: the “ancient incantation” is declared assembled but never shown being completed from fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lagoon-above-clouds acts as both miracle and machine: it supplies the water-bridge of words and the carousel’s halted energy. Sensory economy favors shimmer, crystal fruit, star reflections—always filtered through Cyrus’s treasure-hunter bias. Micro-setting (camera harness) directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography holds; no floating bodies. Setting evolves from frozen to flowing as time realigns, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover lost time/self via ghost negotiation; pressure escalates as fragments must cohere before carousel restarts. One meaningful tightening: camera wheel clicks, bridge solidifies, forcing midpoint walk. Cost is visible—wheel and ghost fuse, foreclosing scavenger identity. Stakes stay personal; no inflation to world-destruction, keeping tension proportionate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reconciling eroded ambition emerges through camera’s resurrection of discarded tech and the ghost as discarded self. Subtext lives in gesture: bent back, smooth-toothed wheel, translucent hands accepting relic. No explicit thesis; final image of merged light and restarting carousel offers non-literal answer. Some abstraction risk in “negotiate with one’s own ghost,” but particulars keep it from sliding into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Cyrus’s perceptual filter—kinetic shimmer, plastic teeth, dew-fresh childhood. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for lagoon awe, clipped clauses when wheel locks. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence issue. Compressed diction under stress (“He stepped gingerly onto the words”) maintains immediacy. Occasional elevated latinate words (“iridescent,” “translucent”) slightly break scavenger lexicon but read as wonder-tinged filtering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. High information density: single sentences deliver scavenger posture, carousel halt, camera discovery. Minimal scaffold; no synonym loops except one “shimmering” echo. Two mixed metaphors—“carousel ground to an abrupt halt” vs. “waters still now”—but they occur early and do not obscure closure. Filter verbs rare; most perception is direct.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fuse of celestial carnival, time-lost scavenger, and disposable-camera magic feels fresh and specific. Carousel-above-clouds trope is borrowed from fantasy but retooled as temporal fault-line. Camera wheel’s worn teeth as time-key is a lovely, grounded inversion of high-tech chrononaut gear. Risk: incantation-from-overheard-stories edges contrivance, yet fragment-collecting motif sustains internal logic. Overall, an imaginative synthesis unlikely to be mistaken for another piece.</comment>
