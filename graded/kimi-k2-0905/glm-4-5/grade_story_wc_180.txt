<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to mend yet fearing further fracture—surface early and stay active in her tactile micro-choices (ribbon knotting, seed planting). The quartz eye and mender past are concrete, not expositional, and her endurance at the end forecloses immediate reunion with visible cost: she waters the seed with both kinds of tears. Flaws complicate action: pride in her “feisty” self-image delays the bag’s opening, giving believable inertia. Minor slip: the organic/quartz eye duality is vivid but never jeopardized under pressure, so the moment of highest strain feels slightly under-cooked.

<comment>Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the apple seed left where the ribbon was re-weights every prior “deciduous vow” with living possibility—undeniable social cost (she may wait years). Lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fallen/resprouted objects culminates in cadence shift at final line. Causality holds: each bridge component emerges from bag contents already present, no teleportation. Orientation clean within 120 words: who (Elara), where (cathedral/orchard), when (post-Great Departure) anchored by sensory action.

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting is not postcard backdrop; rafter-orchard supplies the literal apples she harvests for the bridge and the seed for closure. Micro-setting—moss-pew, column where menders carved names—constrains her planting spot, rooting decision in social history. Sensory hierarchy skews scent-first (sweet apples) matching mender bias for tactile/material cues. Spatial choreography clean: distance from pew to column to rafters tracked as she builds; no impossible positions.

<comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation with absent daughter—signaled in paragraph two and tightens when ribbon → bottle → bridge converts memory into outreach. One meaningful intensification: discovery of fresh footprints and missing ribbon proves external agency, narrowing her options to wait/plant. Cost legible: she forfeits immediate control by burying the seed, accepting orchard’s timescale. Slight reserve: escalation is single-turn; no secondary obstacle complicates after bridge completion.

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “deciduous vows” emerges through material cycle (ribbon out, seed in) rather than thesis statement; reader left to feel wisdom persisting via seasons. Subtext operates in gesture—apple seed as unspoken apology—avoiding moralizing. Final cathedral whisper is accusatory/comforting simultaneously, sustaining ambiguity. Only minor echo of prompt language in “deciduous vows” line, but situated inside Elara’s idiom, not abstract sermon.

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature sharp: quartz eye ache = synesthetic grief; organic eye tears = acceptance of vulnerability. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long sentences for orchard calm, clipped clauses when ribbon first seen. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free-indirect style stays clean; filter verbs (“she felt”) used sparingly and motivated by corporeal imbalance of artificial eye.

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph lengths visually mimic cathedral shafts of light. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory cue, memory, and tool use (“bent nails formed a base for a miniature tree”). No mixed metaphors; orchard/bridge imagery stays internally consistent. Minor template cadence in “She… then she…” sequence during craft montage, but does not touch closure beat.

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalypse cathedral as living arboreal archive + craft-mender using broken keepsakes for reconciliation. Accidental wisdom trope avoids contrived twist; seed left by unknown visitor feels plausible within world rules. Risk taken with lyric repetition of “deciduous” but pattern taught early, paid off in final line. Could swap “quartz eye” for another prosthetic without breaking arc, capping score below 8.5.
