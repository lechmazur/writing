<comment>Kael’s potter-trained attention becomes a credible sense-dial; every micro-choice (brushing buried glass, kneading soil with pottery tools) is traceable to his “center-the-clay” trait and advances his quiet goal. Interiority stays embodied—no diagnostic labels, only haptic cues: glass “warm despite the scorching sun,” ground “thrumming” back at his palms. Stakes deepen through externalized patience: the longer he attends, the more the oasis awakens, making his final resolve feel earned rather than declarative. The closing image of “hands shaping invisible clay” crystallizes his enduring stance and cost—he will carry this vigil and its responsibility to others. Hairline slip: “sharp gentleness” is asserted twice; trimming one would perfect the show-don’t-tell balance.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the smoke flattens into a portal, Kael decides to return with others, and the conceptual cost—now he bears memory’s keepership—hits on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each attentive gesture thickens the texture of possibility until past/present/future resolve into one charged moment. Orientation anchored by the second sentence (who, where, when, motive); mosaic pattern taught early by lantern-glass visions; transitions legible across beats. No causality gaps; the final tightening is the thrumming ground + flattening smoke, not a random flourish.</comment>

<comment>The wasteland/floral contrast is economically sketched in four strokes (“scorched wasteland… inexplicably thriving wildflowers”) yet immediately guides Kael’s investigation. The lantern glass is a micro-setting star: its temperature, fracture map, and refracted timelines constrain every tactic he tries. Spatial choreography is spotless—he kneels, palms the glass, lifts it to sun, works soil; no impossible leaps. Final image of smoke bending light into portals re-weights the whole environment; setting literally supplies the exit window for meaning.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—why kindness-animated pockets resist entropy—stated in paragraph 1; pressure escalates each time Kael’s pottery gestures draw a living response (thrum, flowers tilting, bees twitching). Agency is purely attentive; each moment of “circular yet expanding” care forecloses the option of passive observation. Cost legible: he ends with night-long vigil and future responsibility, no shortcut exit. One micro-turn (smoke flattening → portal) suffices for this length, but a second visible price (fatigue, thirst, personal risk) would have nudged it into 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: attentive care is a renewable technology against decay. Motif of circular motion (potter’s hands, sun patterns, ripple energy) recurs but only scores once it physically revives the oasis—no token symbolism. Final image reframes prior decay as “loyal memory of love,” a resonant non-moral answer. Avoids sermon; lets tactile particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Kael; perception signature is haptic-potter (“hands forming circles of air,” “fingers against… glass”). Rhythm swells then hushes, mirroring his steady breathing and the slow reveal of timelines. No head-hop; diction remains within a craftsman’s lexicon. Only hairline slip: “sharp gentleness” used twice feels editorial; one implied through action would sharpen voice further.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line can deliver sensory, emotional, and conceptual payload (“He held the glass… revealed fractured timelines”). Metaphors are consistent—circles, ripples, light-bending—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances situation or image; final sentence lands cleanly. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence breathes with daylight arc, then tightens into night vigil without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: apiculturist-utopia revived by pottery kinetics + sun-pattern optics; can’t swap “potter” for wanderer without breaking causal chain. Stakes invert eco-collapse trope—life resists via kindness, not tech. Conceptual risk (time-portal lantern glass) pays off because pattern taught in first quarter and reweighted at closure. Specificity of “bees turn slightly in their frames” feels discovered, not templated.</comment>
