<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The scholar’s reticence is shown through whispered phonemes and trembling hands, but we never see a moment where silence costs him something concrete. Interiority drifts toward thematic summary (“sacred duty”) rather than embodied contradiction. Still, the final crystalline listening beat earns a micro-choice that tilts his stance from preservation to translation, giving the arc a modest earned shift.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s dawn tone reweights his mission from archival fixation to forward-looking translation, felt cost legible in the image of dust rising “like spirits.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens—each echoic return thickens pattern recognition until the final resonance reconfigures meaning. The reflective blocks (∼30 %) are interleaved with present-tense sensory cueing, satisfying the BRR exception. One minor loop: “fractured sequences” is repeated five times without fresh inflection, dulling the final cadence.</comment>

<comment>Library at dawn is anchored by slanted light, dust motes, and the single crystal—economy of detail that keeps spatial choreography clean. Crystal-as-micro-setting constrains tactics: its facets literally redirect sound waves, enabling the climactic tonal emission that reweights the quest. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and vibration over visual clutter, mirroring the scholar’s auditory obsession. The “shadowed” descriptor never evolves with daylight, a missed chance to let setting externalize shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode linguistic growth pattern—is signaled early and tightens when crystal reveals living resonance. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic: each echo threatens obsolescence of his archive. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the tonal climax, narrowing options from preservation-only to translation-forward. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but still legible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living root-system, not mausoleum. Subtext sits in the scholar’s bodily hesitation—fingers tracing spines, trembling hands—showing reverence equal to fear. Final image of crystal catching “full light of dawn” reweights earlier darkness without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis statement until the very last whisper, keeping resonance oblique and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person deep POV maintains consistent perceptual bias toward sonic texture over visual spectacle. Syntax elongates in cadence with hush (“suspended hush of knowledge”), then fractures into staccato reminiscence, mirroring the scholar’s mental sequencing. Diction stays within plausible scholar register without jargon dump. Minor register drift: “linguistic extinction” sounds like academic slide deck, briefly cooling the lyric temperature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet efficient—single sentences carry atmosphere, motive, and sensory hit. No scaffold loops; only recurrent phrase is “fractured sequences,” which functions as mantra rather than churn. Rhythm breathes appropriately—long sentences for library hush, shorter bursts for memory shards. Figurative control strong: dust “like spirits” is fresh without purple intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—last scholar decoding living language via sonic crystal—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk taken: 600-word lyric montage held together by echo motif rather than plot reversals, and it pays off. Crystal’s acoustic property is not arbitrary; it literalizes the theme that language never dies, only transforms. Could edge higher if one micro-cost (a dropped book, a cut finger) had grounded abstraction in bodily price.</comment>
