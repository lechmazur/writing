<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is vividly concrete—“the pearl pulsed with an inner light… unlike anything she had ever encountered”—and her shift from observer to participant is embodied in the moment she touches the shadow-infused crystal. Internal contradiction is present: pride in foresight vs. being blindsided, yet this stays in summary rather than erupting in a visible micro-choice. The final smile lands as credible renunciation, but the cost is only implied; we see no forfeiture of her old seer-identity on the page. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and the arc is legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“from being a seer… to a participant in their creation”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is textured rather than strictly causal: each new shadow layer deepens the pattern until the cave’s music re-tunes reality. The Orientation Test is waived: the cave’s glowing walls and melodic resonance anchor who/where within the first 120 words, and the later payoff justifies the initial mild disorientation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first shadow detaches, but the pilgrim’s exit is ellipsed without visible price, keeping this just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The crystal cave is not backdrop but co-protagonist: its “melodic resonance” and “luminous walls” constrain every beat, and the final image of crystalline flowers blooming in bright darkness recharges the setting itself. Micro-setting is satisfied: the cave-pearl’s heartbeat-synced pulse functions as a tool that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is crystal-clear—pilgrim shuffles in, exits into twilight; shadows stretch from floor to crystal. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s seer priorities: sound and light dominate, touch arrives only at the climax, tightening focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“will Elara retain interpretive control?”—is signaled early and tightens when her visions collapse into “a chaos she’d never experienced.” Agency is reactive rather than propulsive: she studies, gasps, murmurs, smiles—no decisive counter-move. Escalation is accumulative: each overlapping shadow thickens air and music, reweighting the stake until the cave re-tunes reality. The cost is conceptual—loss of predictive certainty—but is felt more than seen; a visible forfeiture would lift this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: magic is not foresight but participatory creation. The returning image of “bright darkness” shifts from oxymoron to lived reality at closure, reweighting the premise. Subtext resides in gesture—touching the crystal is consent to unknowing. The final line offers a resonant non-literal answer: “helping to create what might yet become,” avoiding moralizing. Complexity is honored: ambiguity lingers, no symmetry imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction—“nascent,” “steadily unpredictable,” “bright darkness”—is elevated yet consistent with a centuries-old seer’s idiom. Rhythm mirrors the cave’s music: longer sentences swell, then fragment—“Elara gasped”—under pressure. No dialogue to contaminate voice; interior monologue is concrete, never expository. Patterned elision (pilgrim vanishes) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“crystalline flowers in the bright darkness”—and never muddled. Information density is high: each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. One scaffold trace: “overlapping shadows” is repeated four times in close proximity; the slight loop nicks 0.2 but does not dull the closure image. No typos, tense drift, or buried leads.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of seer-blindness + shadow-inhabited crystals + musical cave feels inevitable yet un-stolen. “Bright darkness” is a fresh inflection that grows from the cave’s physics rather than grafted symbolism. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure; the payoff reconfigures meaning without a set-piece battle. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes. The premise could not swap names/places without dissolving the crystalline logic.</comment>
