<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marina’s grief-anchored vigil rings true; the salt-sting memory at twelve and the nightly tapping give her a perceptual signature. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and her endurance at the end is a credible renunciation with cost. Yet she never makes a true micro-choice under pressure; the epiphany arrives as data-pattern recognition rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The lack of on-page action or risk keeps her just inside observational territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: tidal data, atlas overlay, and tapping rhythms layer until the “delayed revelation” reweights the premise. Orientation is clean—station, shelf-edge, post-ban era—by line 6. Closure is a Charged Poise: the folded atlas page becomes a conceptual re-pricing that the planet, not humans, now redraws the map. The cost is felt in her acceptance of erasure, but the beat is observational, not decisive, capping the ceiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station’s metal skin, floorboard dust, and the moored-adrift duality are tactiley anchored and return in the final image. The torn atlas sheet acts as micro-setting: its bleeding ink literalizes rising seas and forces her to re-calculate coastlines on the page. Sensory selection stays narrow—salt, rust, screen glow—matching an engineer’s gaze. Environment directly constrains her only tool (the atlas) and thus charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single stake—why paths vanish—remains coherent but static; pressure accumulates via data, not narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the climax is recognition, not a choice that costs her. The tightening is purely epistemic: coastline numbers overwrite paper, but she neither fights nor capitulates to the loss. Agency is limited to documentation, so escalation plateaus at the conceptual level.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: human cartographies are temporary palimpsest over planetary cycles. The atlas motif re-weights without overt statement; final image of folded page implies surrender to geologic time. Subtext avoids moralizing—no “we must change” sermon—letting silence speak. Ambiguity is controlled: reader feels both loss and inevitability, but the conceptual cost is slightly cerebral compared to visceral.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marina; perceptual signature—“periodically eternal,” “drifting and moored”—is consistent and tide-rhythmic. Syntax swells and retreats, mirroring wave motion; diction stays within a scientist’s lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy is high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in cadence; no template drumbeat. Figurative language is restrained—“coastlines bled like watercolors” is the single extended metaphor and it pays off. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information is dense—each sentence adds data, memory, or sensory hit. Opening and closing lines act as tide-bookends, giving the piece a lyric arc without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The post-fossil-fuel coast is familiar cli-fi territory, but the focus on map obsolescence as delayed planetary revelation feels fresh. Tapping rhythm as scientific ritual is a specific, non-obvious habit that personalizes the observer. No derivative phrasing or borrowed set-pieces. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than set-piece—but coherence and specificity lift it above trope collage.</comment>
