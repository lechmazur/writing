<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lena’s adaptive trait is asserted repeatedly but only demonstrated once—she decides to return to town after the frost reading. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“artist must become the art”) rather than embodied contradiction. The ledger-frost connection is clever but arrives late, so the choice feels more engineered than lived. Earned renunciation is present, yet the emotional cost is stated, not shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the frost patterns crystallize the mineral-smuggling motive and re-weight her art as evidence. Causal chain holds: ledger → frost cipher → industrialist link → decision to act. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; canyon night/art supplies are clear. One minor scaffold: “luminous glass artist known for…” is compressed back-story in opening sentence, but it cues present stakes immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Canyon microclimate is specific—temperature drop, frost chemistry, starlight refracting off treated plates—each detail services the cipher method. Glass plates double as setting-objects that physically constrain her next move (they must be read at dawn). Spatial choreography is crisp: camp perimeter, rock walls, return route implied. The “drifting resonance” is evoked through echo and starlight rather than declared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exposing the smuggling ring before they silence her—arrives late but cleanly. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each frost plate tightens the linkage between her art supplies and illegal mining. Visible cost is conceptual—her art is now weaponized evidence—rather than bodily, but it is legible on-page. Agency is interior (decision to act) rather than overt confrontation, fitting the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation reframes trauma into evidence without moralizing. Frost-as-cipher reweights “beauty” into “map,” a fresh conceptual turn. Final image—“carrying the drifting resonance of the stars within her”—offers resonant reconfiguration rather than slogan. Avoids explicit thesis statement; meaning emerges from material practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a glass-blower’s perceptual signature: light refraction, crystalline lattices, chemical sheen. Syntax stays controlled, no head-hopping. One register lift—“scorched testament”—is earned by context. Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences under stars, shorter fragments at dawn when patterns resolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay within glass/light lexicon. Minor overwrite: “luminous glass artist known for her ethereal creations…” unpacks adjectives before we see the art, but it is single line. Closure line lands clean without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frost-cryptography fusion feels non-obvious and specific to this artist’s materials. Scorched ledger strip as both clue and metaphor for survival is fresh. Canyon microclimate used as forensic tool rather than scenic backdrop. Risk taken: quiet interior resolution instead of thriller confrontation; coherence holds.</comment>
