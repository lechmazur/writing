<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s precision and guilt are embodied early; the rake-handle epiphany, however, is delivered as abstract inscription-reading rather than a pressured micro-choice, so the interior shift feels announced, not dramatized. The final shout to the crowd is a visible action that finally externalizes motive, but the decisive turn hinges on carved slogans rather than on-page contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the once-solitary winder publicly renounces sole ownership of the clock, earning communal restoration—an Earned Stasis with social cost. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the rake handle’s inscriptions act as Accumulative/Textural triggers that crystallize choice, and the final bell is the Decisive Change. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge, brass gears, and weathered rake handle are tactile, selective, and mirrored in Alaric’s emotional state. Spatial choreography stays clean as Alaric climbs; environment constrains the final communal ascent. The ridge’s reflected image in the closing line recharges the stake—community now visible in the same mirror that once showed only self.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—surfaces early and tightens when the inscriptions force Alaric to admit he “cannot restore what we broke alone.” The cost is social exposure, paid on the tower steps. Escalation is single-cycle but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each carved line incrementally reweights his responsibility until the final bell rings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pendulum’s pause and shared labor rather than slogan: precision without connection hollows community. The rake handle’s shift from broken trash to displayed wisdom object reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final image of the whole town reflected in the tidal ridge offers quiet Conceptual Repricing—time now belongs to all.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Alaric’s perceptual filter; diction leans technical when he handles gears, philosophical when reading carvings, maintaining coherent psychic distance. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional elevated phrasing (“searing reverie”) edges toward authorial but remains within his reflective moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; short beats during climb, longer reflective cadence at ridge. One paraphrase loop—“shared balance” repeated in inscription and thought—dings slightly. No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; information density stays high. Closure line is crisp, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clock-winder seeking absolution via broken rake handle is fresh synthesis; communal repair reframes the lone-artisan trope. Risk is moderate—lyric pause in pendulum as mystical moment—but pattern is taught early and pays off in final bell. Specificity of tidal obsidian ridge keeps the world from feeling generic.</comment>
