<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority remains painterly and consistent, but Elara’s contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page; the revelation is received, not enacted. No persistent flaw complicates her tactics—she simply “notices” the answer. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost isconceptual rather than lived, keeping the arc just shy of high-band earnedness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of moonlit images layers until the cathedral glass refracts the stake into a new key. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—moonlight, dew, glass re-weight the floral mystery with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no causal reversals are required under this lens. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Amber pavilion” and “etched glass” are concrete, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image; the glass literally refracts the stake. Seasonal markers (autumn leaves, melting snow) evolve across the montage without lapsing into catalogue. Spatial choreography is implicit but clean—no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain a tactical choice, so capped at 8.2 under 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why night blooms—stated early; pressure escalates by accretion of moonlit postcards and glass panels that reweight the question rather than narrow options. No visible price is paid by Elara (no lost time, money, relationship), so cost remains conceptual. Sufficient for mid-band, but lacks tangible forfeiture that would push 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: perception itself is a prism that creates the beauty it seeks. No moralizing finale; final image of refracted moonlight reconfigures the floral mystery without statement. Subtext operates through recurring glass/moonlight imagery that shifts meaning at the end. Complexity accepted; no tidy thesis imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains painterly diction—“umbral tenderness,” “dust motes like suspended stars”—without purple overload; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm breathes with montage, then tightens inside cathedral. No dialogue to test, so voice distinction bullet waived. Register remains within plausible artist lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphors are coherent (glass → petals) without mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information density high. One paraphrase loop—“dawning hush” repeated in first and last paragraphs—reads as intentional reprise, not artifact. Closure image is crisp; no figurative muddle touches the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—nocturnal flowers seen through etched glass—is fresh synthesis of familiar nature-mystery and art-making. Cathedral window as cognitive pivot feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate: lyric montage instead of scene, but coherence holds. Could tip 8.0+ with sharper irreplaceability of glass mechanic in her actual painting process.</comment>
