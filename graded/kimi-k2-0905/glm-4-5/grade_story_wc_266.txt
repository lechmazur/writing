<comment>Maris’s interiority is poetically coherent—her palm against silver, the shoreline lullaby inside her ears—but the collective “guides” remain interchangeable masks; no individual contradiction or micro-choice surfaces until the star-stamp burns her own skin. That final self-marking is the first credible, embodied cost, earning the quiet renunciation of passenger service for dragon-cradling; until then motivation is atmospheric rather than agentive.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ticket punch re-cast from revenue tool to courage-igniter, dragons curled like living star-stamps. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure thickens through mirrored twilight, mist, lullaby—culminating in the charged image of invisible dragons riding ferry-guides back to daylight. Cost is felt: perpetual vigil, unseen burden, foreclosed normalcy. Causality is soft amid lyric drift, but the final reconfiguration obeys its own invented logic.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the story’s spine: the veiled ridgeway’s ever-thickening mist literally steers the boats away from straight paths, enforcing the “indirect routes” mandate. The black-sand double-moon shore and waterfall of liquid twilight are tactile waypoints that gate the dragon chamber; removal would collapse the quest. Sensory selection mirrors Maris’s hush—sound of wave-licked stone, cool silver, star-glow heat—anchoring wonder without tourist clutter.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—locating dormant courage—remains abstract until embodied dragons appear; prior “pressure” is lyric density, not narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs when the punch burns Maris’s palm, shifting mission from symbolic search to physical guardianship; this carries visible price and forecloses return to mere ticketing. Escalation is textural, not causal, but sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as: courage is not dramatic conquest but quiet, patient potential waiting to be ferried into daylight by willing carriers. The dragons’ cat-size defenselessness subverts heroic cliché; star-dust引申为 dormant capacity reframes the punch’s prior bureaucratic soullessness into blessing tool. Final image—guides wearing invisible dragons like scarves—offers resonant, non-verbal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains hypnotic cadence—“water that seemed neither liquid nor vapor,” “tides that never cease their pull”—without monotony; syntactic variation mirrors ebb-flow. Perceptual signature is collective-mythic, filtering world through ferry-guide mystique; diction stays inside that lexicon. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; compression and elision (“after what might have been hours or moments”) are taught early and paid off in timeless twilight logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined: metaphors stack but follow unified aqueous/astral palette; shoreline lullaby refrain threads without distraction. Minor loop: “gentle persistence” twice in adjacent clauses; single paraphrase shimmer on “indirect routes” explanation. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene, openings vary, strong verbs (“winding,” “punched,” “coiled”) carry weight; no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in climax.</comment>

<comment>Ferrymen guiding souls is ancient, but coupling ticket-punch star-stamps with pocket dragons that are literal un-used courage reframes myth into fresh emotional logic. Indirect-route travel requirement converts lyrical device into plot engine; twilight vigil premise commits fully, no late rule cheats. Specificity—black sand under double moons, waterfall of liquid twilight—prevents generic afterlife scenery. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in charged final image, not gimmick.</comment>
