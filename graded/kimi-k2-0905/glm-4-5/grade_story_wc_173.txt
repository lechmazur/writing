<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyric but thin; the “silver threads” and “echoes” are poetic placeholders rather than concrete, character-specific instruments. The bodily poetic form is asserted, never embodied—no tremor, sweat, or breath-pattern under threat. Her final step into the prism sanctuary is presented as transcendence, yet the cost is asserted (“she had preserved…her soul”) rather than dramatized. Still, the refusal of sexual commodification is a coherent, active stance that forecloses her old life, earning a mid-high score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece is Accumulative/Textural: repetitions of “untangling threads,” “harvest of echoes,” and “between sigh and smile” build density rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by word 50; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara steps into the prism sanctuary and absorbs the chorus of rebellions. The cost, however, is conceptual (“she became both lock and key”) rather than viscerally felt; the absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<comment>The silver courtyard is evoked through selective snow, moonlight, and breath-fog; bodies remain spatially coherent. Micro-setting succeeds: the snowflake “diamante witnesses” and frozen breath act as tactile props that mirror her poise. Weather affects action—snow muffles sound, hides footprints—yet the courtyard never constrains her tactics; it is backdrop, not obstacle. Thus capped just under 8.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberation from the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and never deepens: each “untangling” restates the same abstraction without raising price or narrowing options. No credible loss (time, safety, client, coin) appears on-page. Escalation is lyrical repetition, not causal tightening; the prism sanctuary simply appears when the last thread is named. The absence of a felt price caps this below 7.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: chastity as spiritual self-possession, not virginity. The harvest of echoes reweights earlier courtesans from victims to chorus of preserved selves, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in the image of snowflakes as “diamante witnesses,” letting setting speak the theme. Final line crystallizes the idea without sermon, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyric, elevated, and self-consciously poetic; diction stays within the fairy-tale register it establishes. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for trance, fragments at threshold (“Between sigh and smile”). No dialogue to test naturalism. Compression (“harvest of echoes”) is taught early and paid off at closure. The occasional template cadence (“between sigh and smile” repeated) is the single hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—yet patterns are taught early and do not obscure causality (accumulative design). Mixed metaphors appear: “threads” are simultaneously fate, breath, and literal silver, but the piece is dream-logic, so inconsistency reads intentional. Paraphrase loops are frequent (“she had preserved…”) but short; they dull momentum, not clarity. Closure image is not muddied, so penalty stays mid-range.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chaste courtesan + metaphysical sanctuary + lyric accumulative structure is non-obvious and memorable. The “harvest of echoes” reimages historical sex-workers as collective liberation data-bank—fresh synthesis. Risk is structural: lyric repetition over causal plot, yet coherence holds. Fresh inflection lands in the final reconfiguration of chastity from sexual to spiritual archive-keeping.</comment>
