<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s shadow-wielding intuition is embodied in the orchard ritual, but interiority edges toward generic “peacekeeper” labels; the shard biting her palm is a sharp, specific moment that grounds her courage. The final reconstitution is earned by prior mirror glimpses, yet the elders’ skepticism is off-stage, so the cost feels abstract rather than interpersonal. Flaws (anomaly, risk of failure) are stated, not lived—no visible mistake compounds before success. Still, her calm signature holds across beats, and the refusal to capitulate to fear gives a credible, if quiet, Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain—mirror glimpses → shard → orchard spell → whole crystal—lands cleanly with a visible glowing artifact as cost. Orientation is swift: Elena, lighthouse orchard, full-moon ice night within 60 words. A single micro-turn (weighted breath before elders’ reply) tightens stakes; closure is Charged Poise: the hovering crystal reconfigures meaning, foreclosing doubt. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gnarled apple trees, diamond-faceted in moonlight, and the ice floes groaning below the cliff are sensory, selective, and mirrored in the crystal’s facets—setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: Elena moves from orchard edge to lighthouse beam path; shadows wrap without dislodging her footing. Weather (wind howl, tide shift) cues the ritual’s cadence, constraining timing. The orchard and ice reappear in the closing sweep of light, cementing their symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save settlement from storm via restored scrying tool—is signaled early and personalizes through Elena’s anomalous reputation. Escalation is quiet but coherent: each mirror glimpse accumulates knowledge, tightening the final ritual; the shard’s bite is a micro-cost that foreshadows larger risk. No external antagonist beyond elders’ skepticism, so pressure is internalized; the climactic choice is to act in the weighted breath, not beg approval. Resolution earns reprieve yet leaves social cost (still an outsider) implicit, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme—empathy made tangible—emerges through the literal reassembly of broken visions, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext surfaces in shadows that comfort rather than threaten, reframing darkness as relational glue. The final crystal glow reweights earlier mirror fragments into collective foresight, a Conceptual Repricing that community insight costs individual exile. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature shades description with shadow-metaphors and orchard-tactile bias. Syntax flexes from languid (winter trees) to compressed during spell-casting, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on interior diction: “weighted breath,” “ink-in-water” shadows—repetitive but thematically coherent. Filter verbs minimal; only “seemed to respond” drifts, quickly forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: high density per sentence, minimal scaffold. Figurative strings cluster in the ritual paragraph—purple risk—but pattern is taught (shadow = medium) and pays off. One mixed metaphor: “shadows…like ink in water” adjacent “purple twilight” slightly muddies palette, yet clarifies through context. Rhythm breathes with tide-groans and beam-sweeps; final line lands clean, crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shadow-laced peacekeeper + vintage mirror fragments + ice-orchard spell yields an non-obvious magic system. Premise transcends “fix the crystal” quest by turning empathy into material physics. Specificity—1800s gilded mirror, workman’s honesty mirror—anchors novelty. Risk is quiet (lyric spell vs. battle), but coherent; not genre-shattering yet memorable.</comment>
