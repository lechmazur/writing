<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mentor’s ‘backward-walk’ trait is embodied twice and links exile/his pedagogy, a nice micro-choice. Prisha’s final refusal to retreat mirrors his quirk, showing earned resilience without explicit statement. Interior contradiction is implied but never dramatized in scene, and his exile back-story is told not tested. Still, mentor’s calm knife-edge between authority/uncertainty keeps him particular and the 8-band threshold is cleanly met.

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands: Prisha’s stance crystallizes (Earned Stasis) while the mentor accepts permanent outsider status; cost is felt (“even if the Historians never welcomed him back”). Causal linkage holds: tea-leaf annotation → shard insight → mentor’s partial absorption → student’s resistance to fear. One soft beat—door creak functions only as jump scare, not option shift—keeps this just under the 9 gate.

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Forgotten library is sketched via shelves, dust, arched windows, and the Case/ Wall labels; spatial choreography is clear when mentor paces backward. Shadow caught in glass detaches and interacts with tea leaves, satisfying the object-as-setting 9+ gate. Sensory palette is predominantly visual; tactile or acoustic cues (swing hush is referenced but not heard) would sharpen immersion. Still, selective detail feeds directly into mentor’s annotation ritual, keeping atmosphere purposeful.

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mentor must pass on reversible exile craft without returning to Royal Archives; pressure tightens when Prisha’s first test coincides with the door creak. Escalation is modest—no external antagonist—but agency remains in annotation choices and her refusal to retreat; cost is implicit (mentor will stay exiled). Could use one more complication that threatens the fragile mentor-apprentice bond to reach 8-band.

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-exile emerges through glass shards, repeated shadows, and the student’s stance rather than exposition. Final image reweights earlier playground metaphor into quiet perseverance—an effective Conceptual Repricing. No explicit moralizing; mentor’s dialogue dances around truths, letting implication breathe. Slight abstraction in “exile preserves what it removes” line edges toward thesis-statement, holding this at low-8.

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrative voice is lyric, precise, and consistent—compressed diction (“shard-mirror archivist,” “combative tenderness”) taught immediately and paid off. Free indirect diction slips cleanly into mentor’s idiom; no head-hop. Distinct rhythmic control in “When you work with these…” paragraph; short clauses echo backward steps. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature sustained.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; high information density (“sunlight struggled through the arched windows, casting an afternoon shadow caught in glass on the far wall”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and apt. Register remains elevated-lyric but internally consistent; no mixed metaphors. Clean copy, strong cadence to final line; 9-band ear-test passed.

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reversible exile as craft-training is a fresh twist on magic-memory trope; tea-leaf geometry adds intriguing material specificity. Shadow detached from window turning into annotation ink feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Mentor’s backward walk offers a memorable behavioral hook. While the “palace intrigue shard” is generically familiar, the synthesis of annotation + exile + pedagogy is non-obvious.
