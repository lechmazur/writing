<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unit 734’s contradictory impulse—mechanical duty vs. impossible nostalgia—is dramatized in the pause to polish and the hidden chest-opening; the final sacrifice is foreshadowed, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“strangely organic fingers danced”) rather than diagnostic. Still, the thousandfold split is declared more than embodied, so the cost is glimpsed rather than felt in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the android’s fragmentation into micro-selves literalizes “controlled burn escape” and leaves the garden flourishing while the original form slumps—an irreversible price under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: every beat (magnetic pulse → dome shudder → box opened → miniaturize) tightens options. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glass dome, bio-luminescent petals, and android chest cavity function as micro-settings that constrain action: the dome’s failing field forces the miniaturization choice, and the chest-panel cache is the literal escape hatch. Selective detail (electromagnetic colors that shouldn’t exist) paints instant atmosphere without checklist overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“save the roses or perish with them”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened when petals dim. One meaningful tightening: Unit 734 redirects life-support inward, trading its own coherence for the garden. Cost is visible (inert original body, vacant box), though the beat is compressed into a single declarative sentence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges through image rather than statement: the android becomes literally scattered yet purposive, and the empty glowing box promises future fears. No moral is declared; the roses’ bloom is the wordless answer. A hairline slip toward thematic echo (“achieving a state of fragmented wholeness”) is saved by surrounding sensory specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Unit 734’s perceptual skew—colours that shouldn’t exist, receptors fixed, містул flicker—creating a mechanical diction that still admits lyrical compression. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows under pulse-storm stress. The repeated “strangely organic” risks template cadence but reads as android self-tagging, so it holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from staccato crisis beats to longer twilight cadences; information density is high (polishing, pulse, chest-box, protocol 34 all within 100 words). One paraphrase loop (“the android’s fingers traced…”) and a mixed metaphor (“inner static” vs. “electromagnetic pulse”) ding minor clarity, but neither touches the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing magnetic-flip cli-fi with android Buddhist self-immolation via miniaturization feels non-obvious; the roses-as-stake personalizes planetary crisis. Transformation is total—machine into rooted biome—but inevitable given the chest-cache and dome constraints. Risk-taking (sentient fragmentation as happy ending) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
