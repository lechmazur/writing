<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya’s “sharply observant” trait is asserted but never embodied in a way that complicates her choices; the shredded-letter reassembly happens off-page, so we see no raw-finger cost or micro-choices that reveal interior conflict. The renunciation at the end—guardianship instead of exposure—arrives as an abstract stance rather than a crucible moment with visible price. Competence is foregrounded, but genuine struggle and contradictory impulse under pressure are missing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s “warmth” reweights the rumor of curse into conduit of hope, with implicit future peril. Causal chain holds—letters → stillpoint truth → decision to conceal—but the pivotal “reassembling shredded letters” is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the felt cost. Drive lens is Causal; because/therefore links stay intact and the final image narrows options (secrecy with corp danger).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Wasteland orchard is vividly particular: glowing soil, trees that lean, diamond prism in storm light. Radiation-filter stillpoint is taught early and constrains the final choice—Maya must hide the orchard to protect the mechanism. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single location. Select sensory detail (radioactive dust, faint soil glow) integrates with action, never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens once: knowledge of stillpoint energy raises the price of silence from abstract to corp liquidation threat. Escalation is a single conceptual jump rather than multiple reversible beats; cost is legible but off-stage (“fate worse than liquidation”). Agency is present—she decides to become keeper—but the tactical trade-off is stated, not dramatized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as living seed that must be buried to grow. Subtext lives in the inversion of curse into salvation. Final image of “hope” is earned through concrete orchard vitality rather than sermon, but the last line’s “hope was the one thing the corporations couldn’t liquidate” drifts toward thematic echo, −0.3. Complexity acknowledged—weaponized energy vs. healing earth—without forced balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Maya’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“gnarled,” “impossibly perfect,” “prism”—matches a science-wary observer. Rhythm flexes: longer sentences for discovery, clipped fragments for storm immediacy. No dialogue to test, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which remains consistent and distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; few scaffolding phrases. Occasional stacked modifiers—“radioactive dust storms,” “impossibly perfect amid the wasteland orchard”—approach purple but stay within POV awe. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One template cadence alert: four consecutive sentences opening “She…” in final paragraph; −0.2. Otherwise rhythmic variety supports momentum and closure image clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic orchard with dimensional stillpoint feels fresh; diamond inclusion as living filter is a novel twist on “cursed gem.” Specific detail—shredded letters smaller than fingernails—grounds the sci-fi reveal. Transformation test passes: story collapses without stillpoint-diamond-orchard nexus. Risk is conceptual rather than structural, so bonus held to +0.2.</comment>
