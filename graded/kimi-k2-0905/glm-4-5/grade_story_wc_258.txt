<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is textured—ink-stained fingers, reverence for the tape—but his contradictory impulses stay mostly stated (“he hesitated only a moment”) rather than dramatized. The visitor remains a silhouette; no status tension or divergent speech patterns under pressure. The inherited-cost idea lands as theme, not as a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible price. Earned stasis is implied, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-build via card placements & rain reflections; closure is a Charged Poise—two minds joined, future unwritten but reconfigured. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene, single POV, one transition (door creak). No causal break, yet no persistent constraint or price is crystallized on the page beyond the vague “responsibility.” Cost is conceptual, not embodied—acceptable under CR, but thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skylight rain, onyx cards, brass tape, velvet cloth—selective, tactile, bias-filtered. Loft acts as micro-setting that constrains exposure & acoustics, charges final image (raindrop universes). Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Weather mirrors emotion without overt symbolism. Tape is handled twice, evolves from tool to legacy symbol—meets 9+ gate for object-use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping cultural collapse—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of card-spreads & shared intellect, not narrowing options. No visible price paid on page; stakes remain abstract. “Prevent future crashes” is declared, not dramatized; therefore misses the 8.0+ tightening that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartomancy as cultural algorithm, inheritance as burden. Subtext in gesture (tracing measuring tape) outweighs any overt thesis. Final image of rain-drop universes reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—can patterns really be re-engineered?—inviting reflection. Avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, syntactically varied, rain-soaked rhythm. Perceptual signature strong: Elias notices geometries, ink sheen, brass gleam. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a self-taught scholar. Minor register lift in “conceptual algorithms” forgiven by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence-length variety. Occasional scaffold: “each drop a miniature world” echoed twice; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—cards, tape, rain, legacy packed into 750 words. No loops in final third; prop tracking accurate. Minor synonym churn (“steadily curious” twice) but not in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancy × crypto-collapse × cultural reverse-engineering. Tape as generational data-tool feels specific, not gimmick. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist—coherent under lens. Could swap “cryptocurrency” for any bubble without breaking arc, so freshness capped below 8.5.</comment>
