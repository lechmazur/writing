<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s longing is rendered through lyrical, embodied images (“weight of her former self slipping away”) rather than stock labels, and the culminating dive conveys credible renunciation. Yet her interior contradiction—dock-worker duty versus dream of elsewhere—is stated more than dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice (pressing the scrimshaw to her chest) carries most motivational weight and could use an earlier beat of visible resistance or risk to earn the leap. Still, the arc from guarded to unguarded feels individual and coherent.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain—finding scrimshaw → reading new text → whale call → ritual → island surfacing → dive—is legible and ends with a decisive, irreversible change. Orientation is cleanly anchored in the first two sentences; the single transition (dawn after evening) tracks cleanly. Cost is felt (“taking Mara with it to depths”), though the price feels more mystical than personal; a sharper tangible loss or forfeiture on-page would clinch higher band.</comment>

<comment>“Sublittoral fringe,” “water the color of mercury,” and the nets/docks provide tactile, occupational specificity that seeds later freedom; the whale-bone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the ritual. Sensory selectivity mirrors emotional narrowing: golden light, salt-sugar dissolution. One vivid anchor—the scrimshaw’s smoothness against calloused hands—charges the final dissolution image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Mara’s need to escape inner emptiness—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw text demands detachment from shore. The whale’s call supplies external pressure that narrows options to one: follow or remain. Agency is present (she whispers, dives), but the island’s appearance and absorption feel externally granted; a mid-scene obstacle or sacrifice she must actively overcome would sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-liberation emerges through recurrent water/depth imagery rather than exposition; the final “remembered and welcomed home” reweights earlier emptiness without moralizing. Subtext of work-strength versus fluid identity is woven through dock versus sea contrasts. The disappearing island acts as charged metaphor for evanescent selfhood, avoiding tidy closure yet retaining felt ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The free-indirect lyric voice sustains a rhythmic, oceanic cadence matched to Mara’s fluid motion; compression like “combative tenderness” is taught early and modulates into tender triumph. Perceptual signature—she notices weight, light, salt, nets—remains consistent and character-specific. No dialogue appears; omission is valid and avoids artificial speechifying.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and tide-like rhythm; metaphor strings (“liquid moonlight,” “salt sugar”) cluster near climax but are pattern-taught and payoff-linked, so allowed. Occasional elevated phrase—“perpetual dance of ebb and flow”—skews toward poetic template yet remains within lyrical contract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clarity stays intact through dive sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The post-violence world and summoned-vanishing-island premise refreshes the familiar “escape to true self” arc; scrimshaw-as-key is classic but retooled through whale-song mechanics. Specificity of dock-worker grace lends occupational freshness. Risk-taking resides in mythic lyric mode; could push further by letting Mara’s labor skills actively solve or ransom her transformation rather than mystical summons alone.</comment>
