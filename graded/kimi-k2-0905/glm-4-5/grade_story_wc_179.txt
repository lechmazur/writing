<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s resentment is embodied early through the broken pin and dark aura, giving visceral stakes. Elara’s “scheming pacifist” premise is asserted rather than dramatized—she never schemes or faces a pacifist dilemma on-page; her manipulation is declarative (“I will convince you…”). The cellular-memory epiphany is delivered via guided visualization, not via a micro-choice that costs her anything. Brother’s eleventh-hour apparition is pure external grace; Marcus’s forgiveness is unearned by any prior visible struggle or risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a CR image—two fused boxes—whose cost is conceptual (resentment released) but not felt: no forfeiture, no renounced desire, no visible price paid by Marcus. Causal lens is weak: the broken pin repairs itself because Marcus “feels” forgiveness, not because he makes a decision that risks anything. Mid-story “cellular memory” reveal is an explanatory lull that halts pressure rather than tightens it. Brother’s arrival is coincidence that resolves, violating the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sanctuary rules (soundless, architecture breathes, objects reappear) are taught through action and govern choice—Elara plucks a second box from nowhere, Marcus senses unheard vibrations. Starlight bench and transparent walls supply micro-setting that mirrors internal shift. Spatial logic holds; we track the two boxes cleanly. Setting never constrains the final choice, so capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release resentment—signaled early. Yet pressure plateaus: Elara announces she will “convince,” then does so via exposition; Marcus被动absorbs visions without resistance or escalating cost. No meaningful narrowing of options; the broken pin self-repairs without Marcus risking anything. Escalation is atmospheric (walls breathe) rather than choice-based under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of “shifting grace” is embedded in setting mechanics and the fused-box image, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is thin: brother’s sudden appearance supplies external absolution rather than thematic irony or earned wisdom. Resonance feels pleasant but lightweight because no prior particular is repriced—Marcus’s earlier life remains abstract. Conceptual repricing lands, yet lacks emotional cost to charge it deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually anchored to Marcus’s body (gasps, fingertip vibrations). Prose is textured—“marble floors that seemed to extend infinitely,” “starlight given solid form”—without purple overload. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Elara’s cadence stays soft and directive. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Distinctiveness is moderate: syntax is competent rather than singularly memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</comment>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, sentences varied. Occasional loftiness—“metallic despair,” “shifting grace as reality transforms”—but metaphor stays coherent. No loops or scaffold. Information density is decent; lines often twin image with stakes. Minor overwriting in peak beat (“impossible elegance”) but does not obscure closure. Clean copy; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Liminal sanctuary + soundless rule + self-repairing music box is a fresh combo; grace-as-physics concept intrigues. Execution drifts toward familiar therapeutic-fantasy template: guide-figure info-dumps wisdom, wound heals via vision rather than costly choice. Cellular-memory mechanic is under-realized—could swap with “soul touch” without change. Risk is present but safe; bolder edge would require Marcus to enact forgiveness at personal cost.</comment>
