<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s quietly-proactive healing is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing the pendant, documenting the spiral, placing it on the keyboard—each carrying felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and bias-driven; the amber glow as “conversation between her grandmother's ghost and her own future” is character-particular. The final renunciation is earned: the pendant’s release forecloses the old guilt-laden identity and is anchored in the prior pattern of nature reclaiming tech. Flaws (over-observant self-labeling, slight diagnostic tinge in “stages of grief”) are minor and do not touch the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant offering crystallizes a new stance with undeniable conceptual cost—guilt transmuted into fertile ground for ethical science. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of moss-over-tech images tightens until the final reweighting. Orientation is secure by line 4; no因果 breaks. The only minor slack is a single paraphrase loop “abandoned data center turned moss garden” repeated almost verbatim; it slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is the story’s engine: server racks constrain her path, glass shards underfoot literalize former eggshell-walking, and the moss-woven keyboard becomes the altar of transformation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices spiral drip-patterns, smells rust, hears glass creak—never a catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; she moves from entrance → collapsed server room → central keyboard without drift. The final image (pendant enveloped in emerald moss) recharges every prior “reclamation” motif and satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal: can she graft new meaning onto wounds without erasing the truth? Pressure deepens through pattern accumulation—each organic reclamation image tightens the noose of old guilt until the pendant offering becomes the only viable release. The escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image forecloses retreat: once amber is swallowed by moss, her identity as “watchful dreamer” is permanently redefined. Cost is legible on-page: the pendant’s forfeiture is a tangible loss of talismanic comfort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ethical science must grow from exposed wounds, not from erasure. Subtext resides in gestures—extending the pendant is a secular communion, not explained. The final image refuses a moral, instead offering a visual reweighting: guilt literally greened into life. One tiny echo of thematic articulation (“she had learned to embrace her protected vulnerability as a catalyst”) is cushioned inside an action beat and does not rise to sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight; perceptual signature is scientist-meets-poet—she sees “golden ratio in icicle drip” and smells “honeyed hush.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under decision, matching emotional tempo. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Free-indirect “the phrase had stuck as both accusation and identity” is clean and earned. Minor filter slips (“she felt a subtle shift”) are rare and do not Dilate POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (icicle → spiral → grief map → offering). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for moss reverie, staccato prepositional fragments for glass-crunch tension. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional information. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not exposition. Only one mixed-metaphor risk—“honeyed hush” paired with “balm”—but it passes the ear test and does not reappear at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The moss-over-server conceit is fresh, yet the redemption-through-nature trope is familiar; specificity of the golden-ratio icicle and the keyboard-altar lifts it above cliché. The viral-confession frame is timely but not gimmicky, and the grandmother’s earlier expulsion quietly racializes the institutional critique without overt mention. Risk is moderate—lyric eco-reclamation could have slid into pastoral kitsch—but the scientific gaze and the pendant’s forfeiture keep it taut. Transformation test passes: swap moss for flowers or data-center for lab and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
