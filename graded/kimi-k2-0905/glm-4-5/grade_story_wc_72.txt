<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Diver’s interior contradiction—clinging to academic certainty while the statue dismantles it—surfaces early and recurs, but the final “nod” is gestural shorthand; we never feel the embodied cost of surrendering a lifelong intellectual scaffold. Statue’s “incisively kind” trait is asserted, not dramatized in any choice that risks its own safety or purpose, so the promised kindness stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the emptied ampoule reweights “truth” from data to lived ambiguity, and the diver’s new questions carry undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each spectral wave adds density until the final image crystallizes—though the mid-story paragraph of city backstory is a static block that briefly stalls the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Foxglove-purple shadows on coral-lit ruins is selective, tactile, and filtered through the diver’s widening attention; the garden’s spatial logic stays coherent as fish arcs mirror thought loops. The ampoule-as-micro-setting constrains the final gesture—its emptying literally reconfigures the surrounding water—satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the diver relinquish certainty?”—tightens once: the ampoule’s opening forecloses the option of ever again believing in absolute histories. Pressure escalates by accretion of spectral tableaux, each overlay raising the emotional cost of denial; the final nod is the visible price, though the beat could be sharper if the diver physically relinquished a talisman of the old belief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the city’s spectral certainty becomes the diver’s lived doubt, re-weighted by the empty ampoule. No moralizing—final image of “better questions” is oblique, earned, and resonant. The foxglove stain quietly links beauty and toxicity, letting subtext do the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person flexes psychic distance smoothly, tightening to almost-free-indirect during the liquid haze. Diction stays within the diver’s observational lexicon; telepathic lines carry chime-like cadence distinct from terrestrial syntax, marking alien voice without gimmicks. No head-hopping; statue’s thoughts remain externally cued.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long aqueous sentences swell, then fragment as the vision fades. Occasional “seemed to” filters are POV-motivated uncertainty, not clutter. One paraphrase loop (“truth…thread…structural weakness”) repeats three times; trim would sharpen propulsion, but loop never infects the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Underwater living-statue mentor is fresh, yet the “civilization destroyed by its own perfectionism” arc is familiar; specificity of bioluminescent coral memory-tide lifts it above template. Risky telepathic exposition is justified by stone-body constraint. Final “better questions” reversal avoids tidy triumph, embracing productive ambiguity.</comment>
