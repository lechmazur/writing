<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maia’s silence-driven ascent and her furiously-tranquil mask are vividly embodied; the notebook/timetable beats show micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional turn in the final paragraph drifts toward abstract epiphany (“she had found both her voice and her purpose”) rather than a visible cost paid on the spot. Still, the contradiction between rebellious fire and serene face remains active in scene, earning the high-band nod.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the opened clouds and the notebook in her hand re-weight the stake—she descends with verses that now carry undeniable risk. Causal chain holds: timer beep → storm window → writing act → descent with contraband verses. One minor scaffold: “the power of truth, like lightning, could not be contained forever” tells an image already shown. Overall, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) lands cleanly with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is rendered through selective sensory layers—cold iron staircase, ozone, dancing shadow-verses—each filtered by Maia’s poet-perception. The telescope, timetable, and timer function as micro-settings that constrain choices (when to write, what route to recall). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final image of parted clouds and starfield crystallizes the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicit poetic truth versus state silence—tightens once: the timer’s beek triggers the storm-window writing act that forecloses her safety. Cost is legible: she descends with physical evidence (notebook, timetable) that could condemn her. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; the deepening is the recognition that lightning/verse share uncontainability. No causal turn, but under Accumulative lens the cadence shift from observation to creation is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse mapping: scars as roads, censorship as weather, stars as silent witnesses. No moral is stated; the final image of “storm-kissed wonder” re-prices the premise that beauty survives suppression. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing scars on a timetable rather than explaining tyranny. The idea resists tidy binaries and lingers with plausible ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Maia’s perceptions; diction (“suppressed words,” “rarefied air”) carries a poet’s lexicon without drifting into purple. Rhythm accelerates with storm-sentences, then breathes at the cloud-break, mirroring her inner pulse. No filter-verb clutter; metaphor chain (lightning = truth) is consistent and pattern-taught. Voice feels singular and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but storm-themed and taught early, so earns its place. One micro-loop: “verses she could not yet write but sensed somehow” restates the same idea twice—minor. Closing line lands with image, not explanation. Clean enough for 9-territory but for that hairline repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of abandoned observatory, darkroom timer, and bus-timetable cartography feels fresh and specific; the lightning-window as publication slot is an elegant conceptual flip. Risk is taken with lyrical accumulation rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the final image. Minor deduction: the censored-poet trope is familiar, though re-anchored by timetable scars. Still, synthesis is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
