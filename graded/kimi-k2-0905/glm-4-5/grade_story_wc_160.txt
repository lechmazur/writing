<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s inner contradiction—the trembling anxiety versus the slyly heartfelt gambit—remains vivid; the chain-as-talisman choice at the end is earned. Yet the “encrypted compassion” epiphany is stated more than dramatized in body or breath, keeping her from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: she commits to the seasonal-lake plan, stakes the chain as both proof and promise, and the amphitheater’s future is reconfigured. Causal chain holds: adhesive clue → hidden inscription → design sketch → tomorrow’s risk. Orientation clear by 120 w. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final envelope gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Volcanic amphitheater breathes, chain glints, moss under knees—selective, POV-filtered, and the inscription physically redirects the design. Micro-setting (chain) becomes the final talisman; environment constrains water paths. Missing 9+ gate: no single detail alters a tactical choice in the climax beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. flood—tightens once via the inscription’s seasonal-lake compromise; options narrow from binary to hybrid. Escalation is single but meaningful; cost is future political risk, felt in the tremor that shifts to certainty. Agency remains internal/design, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-inheritance emerges from adhesive chemistry, grandfather’s chain, and mirrored encryption; no moralizing summary. Final image of folded envelope re-weights “encrypted compassion” without stating it. Could use one more concrete cost on-page to reach higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual quirks—rust links “gleam faintly,” solvent scent triggers memory. Rhythm breathes with amphitheater, avoids syntactic loops. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” phrase feels academic for her idiom, minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong density—most sentences do two jobs (action + metaphor). Occasional modifier stacks (“dappled resolve,” “tremulous confidence”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and holds. No loops, no scaffold, clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floodgate machinist meets volcanic ruin with seasonal mirror-lake solution—fresh synthesis of civil-engineering puzzle and heritage stakes. “Encrypted compassion” via 19th-century adhesive is a lovely, non-obvious reveal. Risk in lyric repetition pays off; not a template echo.</comment>
