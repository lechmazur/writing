<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his haptic reading of the matrix chip, the ache of “paths not taken” as literal doors. The renunciation of inherited loneliness is earned: the ants, the creek, the chip all pressure him toward a self-chosen solitude. One beat of embodied contradiction—hand steady while pulse races—would have nudged this into 8.5. Flaw: late label “self-revelation” abstracts what the body has already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the doorway image reweights every prior map, the cost is the irreversibility of chosen solitude. Causal chain holds—mentor’s promise → chip → ants → pool → doors—each link tightening options. The creek rising tracks emotional tempo without coincidence. Only the missing midstory micro-choice (a moment where Elias could quit but doesn’t) keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flowers as star-fields, the matrix chip projecting living glyphs—details are selective, POV-filtered, and motile. The blooming cavern constrains the final stance: light patterns literally paint his alternative lives. Spatial choreography is flawless; the creek’s swell is tracked in inches and heartbeats. One less stock phrase (“like stars”) would have reached 8.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape inherited cartography of regret—is signaled in line 2 and tightened when each door displays an unlived life. The price is paid in irrevocable choice: once he steps, the other doors vanish. Escalation is textural (density of images, rising creek) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyrical lens. A sharper material loss (the chip dissolving?) could have pushed 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as cartography of interior versus exterior journey—maps are rewritten by walking. Subtext is embedded in gesture: ants erase the border between city map and wild territory. Final image reframes solitude from curse to instrument without declaring it. A single overt line—“his true purpose”—skirts thematic echo but lands safely in prior image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is antiquarian-poetic: parchment ghosts, star-field flowers, weight of “thirty years” carried in cadence. Perceptual signature—Elias notices relief, serif, kerning in nature—remains consistent. Rhythm swells with creek and heartbeat, no filter-verb clutter. One misplaced academicism (“conceptual repricing”) in closing paragraph grazes register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence layers cartographic metaphor onto emotional beat. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay inside physical logic (water = ink, crystals = lenses). Opening and closing lines act as cartographic legend and compass-rose. A micro-tighten—delete “testament to solitude” cliché—would hit 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ant trail as map legend, type matrix as projector of life-paths. Risk is quiet—no monster, no treasure—yet stakes feel large because regret is made literally visible. Transformation test fails if relocated to any other profession; map-dealer’s lore is inseparable from metaphor engine. Slight familiarity of “mystical cave of choices” keeps it from 8.6.</comment>
