<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and character-specific; the nautilus shell as extension of self under pressure works. No contradictory impulses in scene—memory-flow is linear, not conflicting—so the 9+ gate fails. Still, the collapse beat carries credible cost and ties to the grandfather gift, earning the renunciation. Voice remains consistent, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of memory-images tightens until the shell-glow cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: conductor stance crystallizes with physical collapse, cost legible in “exhaustion finally claimed him.” No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3. One micro turn—shell begins to glow—suffices. Lacks persistent constraint that shapes later tactics, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Glass spire and frozen lake double as instrument and score, constraining his stance; the mirrored horizon literally refracts his desk at climax. Shell micro-setting handled in motion, circled back to press against forehead—tactile constraint under exhaustion. Sensory hierarchy favors light-sound-touch, filtered through synesthetic composer-perception. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: convert private memory into audible-unheard symphony before exhaustion wins. Escalation is density of recalled sensory fragments that tighten temporal noose; dawn light is the external metronome. Cost paid on-page: collapse forecloses any repeat performance. One meaningful deepening—shell glow syncs with internal crescendo—satisfies lens. No second reversal, so stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as time’s refusal to be conquered by art; the symphony is heard only by lake and spire, not humans. Final image reweights earlier fortune-cookie messages into “invisible dance,” a conceptual repricing that leaves writer spent. No moralizing; resonance carried by mirrored horizon now emptied of its conductor. Chronological homesickness rendered as aesthetic exile—specific, not abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric singular, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—taste of honey becomes major chord, etc.—taught early and paid off. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: crescendo of clause length until collapse. No dialogue, so voice-distinct test waived. Register stays within composer’s poetic lexicon; no corporate drift. Compression in final clause (“upturned hush”) is earned cadence rest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory memory, stakes, and metaphor without scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; “memories flowed like water” appears once and is justified. Mixed metaphor check: spiral shell / frozen lake horizon maintains optical logic, no clash. One filter-verb cluster (“he could feel”) appears but falls outside final third; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie cryptic meets orchestral synesthesia, rendered through shell-optics and frozen acoustics. Risk of preciousness is countered by bodily collapse—cost grounds concept. Not a simple magical-realist trope; memory-as-score is literalized in light refracting on desk. Hindsight inevitability: every image (lake mirror, shell chambers) feeds the final unheard cadence.</comment>
