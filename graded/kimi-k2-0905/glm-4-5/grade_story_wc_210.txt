<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elior’s interior contradiction—clinging to alchemical patience while craving communal rebirth—drives every beat, but his final leap from hermit to civic architect is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost (loneliness, ridicule risk) is named, not dramatized, so the renunciation feels efficient rather than paid in blood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is lean and legible: bottle contemplation → memory cascade → manifesto dawn → square action; the “awakening town” ellipsis between paragraphs could disorient, yet the final posting of notices re-grounds time and place, delivering a Conceptual Repricing that makes the sealed bottle re-weight the whole civic premise at visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paper-lantern light on empty lampposts, the bay window’s amber glow, and the square’s dawn bulletin board are sketched with cinematic economy; the lanterns double as emotional gauge, charging the last image when townsfolk arrive, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must constrain or crystallize the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can a place live without spirit?—tightens once: from external improvements to internal reckoning; Elior’s agency is cerebral (conceive, post notices) rather than tested under opposition, so the escalation is intellectual, not visceral, keeping the beat just shy of high-band cost intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: sealed potential → communal crucible; the lanterns’ hollow glow re-prices the premise at closure, showing civilization as alchemy of shared attention, not infrastructure—an insight earned through concrete imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays close to Elior’s alchemical perceptual filter—shadows inside glass, town as retort—without head-hop; syntax is calm, slightly archaic, matching the hermit-academic diction, and the final cadence lifts into understated triumph without voice break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no scaffold loops, no metaphor tangles, no register drift; each paragraph advances premise or stakes, and the final line lands with echoing brevity that satisfies the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ghost-town/alchemy synthesis feels fresh: bottled shadows as civic metaphor, revival via manifesto-not-magic; the risk of didactic utopia is flirted with but dodged by keeping the plan outline off-stage and the closure image communal, not prescriptive.</comment>
