<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer’s motive—“to discover the texture of connection”—is stated repeatedly yet never tested by an opposing want or external pressure; interiority stays abstract (“feeling the sound wash over her”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice risks anything tangible, so the final smile feels unearned. The absence of stakes or cost keeps motivation declarative, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers sensory echoes until the final Charged Poise reweights silence itself. Orientation is swift and clean; the only causality slack is that the lamp lens “awakens dormant memories” without an on-page trigger we can witness. Closure lands—the lab becomes a “cathedral of resonance”—but the cost is conceptual, not felt by the protagonist, slightly undercutting the repricing.</comment>

<comment>“Golden shadows” and “dust motes like tiny spirits” give the lab a tactile glow; the carbide lens micro-setting acts as both tool and relic, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays steady; no world-rule inconsistency. For 9+ gate, the lens needed to constrain a physical choice—here it only prompts reflection—so capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover texture of connection”—stays abstract; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No beat narrows her options or exacts a price; escalation is a slow accumulation of wonder rather than a meaningful tightening. The final image reconfigures meaning, but because the protagonist neither risks nor forfeits anything, the conflict registers as tonal, not consequential.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: sound as trans-temporal communion. Subtext is thin—no gesture or silence contradicts the sermon—but the final non-literal image avoids moralizing. The concept stays coherent; complexity is modest, limited by the protagonist’s frictionless journey.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays stable, with perceptual signature in crystalline acoustics. Rhythm modulates between cathedral cadence and miner grit, giving texture. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction occasionally drifts toward self-help (“quest had become an artificial pilgrimage”) but remains readable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence lengths swell and contract like breath. No scaffold loops, but figurative layering is dense—sometimes two metaphors per sentence—without pattern payoff, clipping momentum. High information density; minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to remember”) dull immediacy in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: rescued industrial sound as holy relic. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet avoids familiar templates. Risk is formal—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Could tip higher if the lens had forced a tangible sacrifice.</comment>
