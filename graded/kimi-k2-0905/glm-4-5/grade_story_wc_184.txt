<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s “warmly methodical” trait is shown through tactile kit-layout and braid-photography, but interior contradiction is thin: no moment where herArchive-orderliness collides with fear of vanishing. The final beat—facing Croft—lands as neat wish-fulfilment rather than a renunciation with visible cost; the emotional plateau feels safe, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: seal → notes → door → rope → merge, each because/therefore link legible. Closure gives a Conceptual Repricing—Croft’s living presence reweights the absence myth—but the cost is only intellectual, not visceral; the rope’s hum never translates into Eleanor’s forfeiture on the page, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clock-tower brass, lantern glare, and shifting-braid rope micro-setting are tightly filtered through archivist senses; the rope’s pattern-change literally constrains the final action. Spatial choreography stays crisp—no floating props. Early anchor (who/where/when) arrives by word 30, satisfying orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand vanishings to prevent more”—is signaled early and tightened when braid-alteration risks her own erasure. Escalation is single-cycle but effective: the merge forecloses retreat, confronting her with the absent professor. Cost is implied not felt; consequence stays conceptual rather than corporeal or emotional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “absence as navigable archive” emerges through seal, rope, and Croft’s re-appearance rather than statement. Final image of clasped hands across time offers quiet resonance, but the piece shies from darker implication—Eleanor never confronts that she might become another catalogued absence. Complexity is clear, yet moral weight stays academic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains archivist diction—“preservation wax,” “transfer papers”—with restrained metaphor, matching methodical lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens imperceptibly as rope begins to vibrate. Rhythm modulates: longer syntactic chains for cataloguing, staccato fragments under golden flare. Distinct perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers tool, action, and temporal rule. No scaffold loops; metaphor count stays low and functional. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“crystallised,” “conceptualised”) nudges register above Eleanor’s observable lexicon, but infrequent enough to keep clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Temporal-archive premise feels fresh against campus-ghost tropes; mechanic of braid-reconfiguration is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test passes—story collapses without clock-room, seal, rope. Risk is moderate: hinge beat relies on 200-year celestial door, but causal set-up justifies it. Croft’s alive-return avoids cliché by reweighting myth rather than delivering horror.</comment>
