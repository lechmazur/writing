<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ayla’s shift from “jittery courier” to deliverer-of-wonder is legible and touching, but the interior contradiction is told (“confidence replacing the jitters”) rather than dramatized in a final beat; the mentor’s absence is a felt ache yet never complicates her on-page choice, so the change leans more declarative than embodied. Micro-choices—touching the pendant, pausing to watch auroras—are present but low-pressure; no beat forces her to risk the pendant or her new identity, so the arc is emotionally resonant but causally soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: aurora-lit treks, germinating footprints, and pendant-glow layers accrue until the final image reweights “routine” into wonder. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chest-hollow and tremoring earth make the cost felt without overt declaration. One causality gap: the shortcut beat (old woman) is lovely but unmotivated—why share it?—yet it doesn’t break the dominant pattern. Orientation is solid; stakes tighten from delivery task to self-redefinition; the ending image crystallizes options under its own lyrical logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ridgeway, auroras, and pendant-as-micro-setting are vivid and selective; snow underfoot becomes a living calendar of her passage. The environment never blocks or wounds her, so constraint is aesthetic rather than tactical, capping the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors visual shimmer; other senses appear but stay subordinate. Spatial choreography is clean; village distance and ridge descent track logically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: deliver pendant before solstice; secondary stake is awaken wonder within herself. Escalation is textural—each sympathetic vibration adds luminous footprints and village anticipation rather than narrowing options. No visible price is extracted (time, injury, social risk), so tension stays atmospheric; the final reconfiguration is poetic but not a trade-off. Coincidence is allowed under Accumulative lens; it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the anti-deus rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder germinates in ordinary exchange, not artifact possession. Final image of earth “remembering” reweights the pendant’s earlier rule without moralizing. Subtext operates through iterative germination imagery (seeds, footprints, stories). One soft echo near end—“wonder wasn’t delivered… awakened within them”—flirts with thesis statement but is saved by its placement before the resonant final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays consistently inside Ayla’s perceptual filter: nervous finger-touches, aurora shimmer as mood barometer. Syntax flexes from short nervous pulses to longer lyric cadences that mirror aurora sweep. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice carries idiosyncratic diction (“dragonfly-wing,” “germinate something”) without strain. Filter verbs are few and justified; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentences vary naturally. Occasional soft loops (“pendant began vibrating sympathetically once more”) and two “germinate” repetitions in close proximity, but none sit in the final third or obscure closure image. Metaphors stay coherent (aurora=path, earth=memory). Information density is high; each sentence advances image or arc. No scaffolding or synonym churn in climax beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fantasy courier-with-magic-artifact is familiar, but the pendant’s power to elongate micro-interactions into shared knowledge feels fresh and quietly social rather than combative. Germinating footprints literalize theme without slipping into eco-allegory. Mentor absence and community garden seeds recast standard quest into something gentler, risking sentimentality yet avoiding it through concrete specificity. Synthesis is specific enough that swapping artifact or landscape would break the emotional calculus.</comment>
