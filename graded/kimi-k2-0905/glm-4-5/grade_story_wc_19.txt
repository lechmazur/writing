<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-hunger are viscerally embodied; the doll anchors her panic and later pairs with the vessel in a charged poise. The inversion ascent forces her to confront both fears, producing a credible renunciation of earth-dread. Internal contradiction is present but summarized rather than dramatized in scene—no moment shows her simultaneously yearning and terrified while acting. Still, the ending’s cost (loss of sky-silence, return to bunker) is legible and scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: “because she fears enclosed silence, therefore she seeks inverted-gravity silence.” The inversion hour is a single, taught rule; its payoff is the decisive ascent and descent that reconfigure her stance toward the bunker. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the gilded hush is contained but must be left behind, foreclosing future ascents. One micro-turn—gravity normalizes—forces the return; no soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bunker corridors, inverted sky, and xenial trellis are sketched with selective, sense-driven detail. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (she must leave it as sentinel). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The “silver-vined flowers” image reappears in the final line, charging the closure; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—obtain gilded hush to heal claustrophobia—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when gravity re-normalizes and she must descend, forfeiting the sky. Cost is the loss of direct access to the hush; this is conceptual but legible. Agency is present—she chooses to ascend and later to descend with the vessel—though the inversion itself is external, it complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges through the parallel between enclosed bunker silence and open sky silence; both are tasted, weighted, and traded. The ending’s image of doll beside vessel reconfigures meaning: confinement and transcendence coexist. No final moral is stated; resonance is left in the charged poise. Subtext operates in the unspoken recognition that the hush cannot be kept, only remembered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—sound-tasting, spatial dread, floral luminosity. Syntax lengthens during ascent to mimic thinning air, then contracts on descent. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are coherent and POV-apt. One near-repeat of “silence that tasted” is forgivable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with altitude; sentences breathe at height, tighten underground. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; only one mixed metaphor (“seedling about to sprout toward the nourishing light”) is minor. Information density is high—each line advances image, stake, or interiority. Final line is crisp and recharging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Gravity inversion as annual, one-hour anomaly is a fresh speculative hook; pairing it with synesthetic silence-collecting is specific to this narrator. Transformation test fails—names/places could swap—but the sensory conceit and porcelain doll counterbalance. Xenial trellis and grandfather’s sound vessel are non-generic inventions. Risk is moderate but coherent; no late rule change.</comment>
