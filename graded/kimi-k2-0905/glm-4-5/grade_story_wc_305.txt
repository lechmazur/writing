<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority floats in lyrical paraphrase—“contentment eluded her still,” “kindly decisive nature”—rather than dramatized contradiction. Climb and grotto supply embodied pressure, yet emotional beats are narrated from outside, blurring micro-choices. Forgiveness is asserted, not tested in scene, so the final “she had become the source herself” feels bestowed, not earned at visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: hairpin warmth + cloud-floor kneeling dramatize her shift from seeking to being the source, cost legible under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 5; one soft transition (ascent→grotto) is taught by spatial anchors. Cyclic refrain risks over-explanation, but persistent scallop/cedar imagery tightens pattern without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Cedar, hairpin, and cloud-floor function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Scallop-shell light and “vineyard hush” are selective, sensory, character-filtered. Weathered bark and moonstone warmth are tactile, lived-in; no geographic drift. Setting evolution (tree→cloud→grotto) tracks cleanly with emotional altitude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—inner peace—signals early; escalation is textured, not causal: density of scallop/cedar images tightens emotional pitch. No external antagonist, yet grotto breathing and hairpin pulse act as environmental pressure. Final renunciation (removes hairpin, kneels) narrows options at cost of ancestral identity. Tightening is present but gentler than high-band benchmark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through hairpin lineage, cedar longevity, and forgiving arson—never moralized. Final image of “she had become the source” reweights prior seeking without sermon. Ambiguity remains: destruction as pearl-irritant is evocative yet not fully dramatized. Subtext operates in scallop shells and cloud swirls, inviting rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s vineyard-hush perception; perceptual signature is consistent. Sentence rhythm mimics breath: long clauses for climb, clipped whispers in grotto. No head-hops; diction stays within pastoral lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors organic to caretaker’s arboreal life.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template stems or synonym loops. Some elevated phrasing—“umbral space,” “conceptual repricing” regions—edges toward register drift but remains within caretaker’s ceremonial voice. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffolding: “as she had trained to do since childhood” restates known role.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of arborist pilgrimage with after-life grotto feels fresh; scallop-shell light pattern is specific invention. Transformation of betrayal→pearl via cedar climb is non-obvious synthesis. Risk of lyrical abstraction is taken but paid off in final cloud-floor kneel. Could swap vineyard hush for another quiet metaphor, so not fully singular.</comment>
