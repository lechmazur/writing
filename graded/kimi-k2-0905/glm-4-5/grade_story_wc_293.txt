<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-rooted need to redeem “never” gives his ascent clear motive; the glass flake functions as an embodied choice-trigger, not mere symbol. Yet interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“luminous disbelief” repeated) that blurs micro-decisions under the scaffold. Still, his final step onto the wrap-mapped pathway carries earned cost: he forsakes the safe pull-out and the brother-ghost it represents.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias commits to trans-world passage, cost paid by relinquishing terrestrial certitude; the flake-projected bridge image makes the conceptual re-price undeniable. Causality holds—each recount utterance literally re-configures the scaffold wrap—so Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and holds to last line. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props or late rule breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mountain pull-out, guard-rail glass, and wind-mapped scaffold are filtered through musician perception (vibration, pitch, echo), giving sensory hierarchy. The scaffold’s evolving geometry supplies the micro-setting that literally channels Elias’s final step, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Only minor drift: “construction site below” stays visually vague, but spatial logic holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias re-open the sealed border of “never”?—tightens when each spoken sentence re-patterns the wrap, turning observation into irreversible pathway. One meaningful deepening suffices: the flake’s projection upgrades vanishing from miracle witnessed to door entered. Cost is legible—he walks off the mountain, severing terrestrial tether—but pressure plateaus rather than spikes; a second beat of risk (fatigue, vertigo) could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive traversal emerges through glass-bridge recurrence rather than thesis statement; final image reframes prior “pixelated amnesty” as iterative invitation, not miracle exception. Subtext—music as transit visa—stays implicit, though line “music a bridge between worlds” flirts with Echo. Complexity upheld: no moral guarantees offered, only possibility sculpted from rejection’s ash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elias’s sensorium: fingernail vibration, scent substitution, wrap-map reading. Syntax loosens into poetical cadence (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) but remains consistent and taught early. Zero head-hopping; perceptual signature distinguishes him from vanished hitchhiker. Dialogue absent by design—no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; strong verbs (“pixelated,” “re-count,” “re-configure”) carry load without modifier clutter. Occasional lyrical amplification (“symphony of pixelated amnesty”) borders on stacked metaphor yet serves cadence. No loops, paraphrase, or filter-verb stacks; pronouns clean, temporal order clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing obsolete wet-plate flake with digital “pixelated” dissolution feels fresh; scaffold wrap as star-map is original spatial device. Risk—non-realist vanishing mid-realist mountain—commits fully and pays off causally. Only echo: “bridge-song” trope faintly recalls Orpheus, but specific mechanic (music re-programs construction plastic) transforms it beyond trope.</comment>
