<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlo’s “uncanny ability to identify people's walks” is shown twice (evading inspectors; detecting Vance), grounding his competence. His micro-choice—whispering directions five minutes early—reveals a hierarchy of values: subterfuge over confrontation. The zodiac coin and key function as tactile extensions of his superstition and self-reliance, handled under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of actual risk (exposure to Vance) is summarized rather than lived, blunting the cost of his gamble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: geomagnetic storm → acoustic anomaly → Marlo exploits whispers → Vance’s shout fails. The “folded-map creases form zodiac signs” supplies a visual micro-turn that pays off when the final map is added. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marlo’s whisper network is now institutionally visible, yet he accepts perpetual secrecy—cost is the foreclosed possibility of recognition. One scaffold loop: “the geomagnetic storm had intensified… storm was intensifying now” could compress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is rendered through motion—boots splashing, welded seams vibrating—so setting constrains acoustics and stealth paths. The humming metal and blackout zones evolve with the storm, directly enabling the climax. Micro-setting objects (coin, key, maps) are palpably handled and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating corridors or impossible sight-lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove whispers outperform shouts. Pressure tightens once: Vance’s arrival forces Marlo to let his unseen tactic speak for him, narrowing options to silent victory or exposure. Cost is legible—he remains invisible labor, map updated rather than celebrated. Agency is pure; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: invisible knowledge systems (whispers, maps, gait-prints) versus brute authority. Subtext lives in gesture—Marlo’s shrug, coin’s cooldown—never thesis. Final image of the new map reweights premise: mastery accumulates in secret, a quiet conceptual cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether this is triumph or resignation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marlo’s sensorium; perceptual signature is auditory and tactile—footfall rhythms, coin warmth, corrugated resonance. Syntax mirrors stealth: long sentences for navigation, staccato for detected steps. No head-hopping; Vance’s interior is only inferred via sound. Distinct idiom in “might as well toss it for good measure” keeps voice口语化 yet character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density high: one sentence often does setting, motion, and metaphor (“boots splashing in puddles… metal structures hum”). Rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic patterns. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, strategic, never muddies peak beat. Clean grammar; no typos.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: port-acoustics espionage via gait-recognition and zodiac cartography—strange yet utterly credible. Risk taken in quiet climax (no shouted confrontation) pays off because acoustic rules are fore-grounded. Container labyrinth feels specific to this story, not generic noir dock. Transformation test passes: swap setting or skill and plot collapses.</comment>
