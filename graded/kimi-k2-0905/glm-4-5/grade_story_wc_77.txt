<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vivid—his contradictory pull toward both repulsion and allure is embodied in every beat. Yet the “photographically cursed” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we never see a concrete photograph that foils or costs him. The final self-recognition is earned, but the advisor’s instant reveal as future-self feels lightly set-up. micro-choices track cleanly, but the absence of a tangible photographic stakes keeps this from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as legitimate Conceptual Repricing: the clasp dissolves into his veins, reweighting death from terror to invitation. Causal lens holds—each paradox read aloud escalates the advisor’s solidity and the protagonist’s surrender. Orientation is taught by sentence one (“after my resuscitation”) and paid off at dawn. The persistent cost is the cursed luminance now inside him, visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors, velvet curtain, and moonlit decay are selectively sketched yet atmospheric; the body-as-setting appears in the vein-lit final image. Spatial choreography is clear—no impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to the POV’s dread-filter. While the carnival could be any carnival, the mirror-chamber and clasp gain irreplaceable charge by closure, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming fear of death—threads every beat. Escalation is textural: each paradox tightens the advisor’s form and the luminance’s intrusion until the protagonist yields. Agency resides in reading and touching; renunciation of fear is the decisive cost. No coincidence; pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens with visible bodily price at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: death as perpetual rebirth, curses as gifts. No overt thesis—insight crystallizes when the clasp dissolves into light inside his veins. The repulsive allure of transformation is felt, not labeled. Final image reweights prior horror into radiant acceptance, achieving non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person maintains a hypnotic, paradox-laden cadence that mirrors the funhouse disorientation. Diction stays within a mystic, death-haunted lexicon without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—light crawls on skin, whisper penetrates thoughts. Repetition of paradoxical phrases is pattern-taught and pays off at the dissolve, justifying the stylized texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene beats—short clauses under pressure, longer rolls during revelation. No synonym loops or scaffold strokes. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent; luminous veins work because foreshadowed. One mixed metaphor drift—“sickly, beautiful light”—is minor and does not touch closure. High information density; each sentence advances image or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “photographic curse” plus paradoxical dream-dictionary is a fresh synthesis; carnival funhouse as liminal death-space avoids cliché by interior luminance rule. Risk—lyric repetition and abstract stakes—pays off in embodied final image. Specificity of “opera cloak clasp” and vein-light keeps it from generic nowhere. Transformation test fails if relocated, confirming originality. Slight bump for bold lyric compression that heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
