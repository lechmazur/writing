<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation—hushing a coded prophecy that haunts his dreams—is stated early and sustained, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“quiet intensity,” “terrestrially cosmic forces”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are present yet feel choreographed by the ritual rather than revealing personal flaw or genuine struggle; the cost is aesthetic (loss of the paper crane) rather than psychic. No contradictory impulse complicates the single-minded quest, so the arc is smooth but thin. Still, the voice remains consistent and the renunciation lands with a visible, if gentle, price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early—moonlight, water, paper—and returns to it at the end when the reconstructed crane floats away, achieving a Charged Poise closure: the prophecy is contained, balance restored, and the hush itself becomes the cost. Causality is internal and ritualistic rather than external-event driven; each beat layers density rather than narrows options. Orientation is clear inside the first 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The final image reweights the stakes without exposition, meeting the 9+ test for closure with cost, but the absence of a second tightening keeps it just below the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brook, moonlit water, and paper wing function as micro-setting: water’s rhythm paces breath, paper’s translucence signals interface with the unseen, and moonlight teaches the textural palette. Spatial choreography stays clean—kneeling, palm-cradling, air-tracing, releasing—each gesture grounded in the immediate circle of power. Sensory selection is biased to the summoner's priorities: hush, flow, silver light. The environment constrains the ritual’s tempo and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the prophecy from breaking silence—is signaled early and held. Pressure escalates via textural accumulation: each breath, glow, and fold thickens the quiet until the paper absorbs the code; the meaningful tightening is the moment the wing becomes translucent—options narrow to release or be consumed. Cost is the loss of the gifted artifact, felt but not viscerally scaled to human risk. Meets the 8.8 gate for legible price, yet lacks a secondary pressure or trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges as the conservation of silence itself—knowledge so dangerous it must be folded into beauty and let go. Subtext operates in gesture: folding, breathing, releasing imply that wisdom is active renunciation, not possession. The ending image—crane drifting downstream—offers a non-literal answer: peace is the art of carrying threat away rather than destroying it. No moral is stated; resonance is built from the repeating motifs of paper, water, and hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the summoner; perceptual signature is lyrical, synesthetic (“moonlight weaving silver,” “tranquil blaze”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual tempo; no head-hopping. Diction remains within a mystic scholar’s lexicon—“terrestrially cosmic,” “mapping silence”—without register drift. The voice is consistent, textured, and teaches its pattern early; satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density is high—each line layers image, motion, or ritual step. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “amid whispered secrets” (three uses) and “quiet brook” echo, but not in peak beats. Mixed metaphors (“tranquil blaze”) are intentional and coherent within the lyric register. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.4</question><comment>Folding a prophecy into a paper crane and releasing it into a moonlit brook is a fresh synthesis of origami magic and silence-work. The concept of “mapping silence” as ritual geography is non-obvious and internally consistent. Tropes—lone mage, haunted dream, magical origami—are transformed through sensory specificity and the final renunciation. Risk is quiet, but coherence is high; feels memorable rather than gimmicked.</comment>
