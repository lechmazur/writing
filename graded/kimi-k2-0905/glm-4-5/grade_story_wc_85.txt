<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Martin’s interior contradiction—guilt over erasing his own lineage while selling false pasts to others—drives every beat. The trembling hand, the bile, the kneeling on cold stone embody his rot. The final micro-choice—laying both watch hand and carving in the sand—earns renunciation with visible cost: tears “washing away layers of deception.” No therapy-speak; the body keeps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by 120 words: cobalt terrace, dusk, watch hand. Causal chain holds: manufactured memories → suppressed past → nightly shore ritual → found carving → recognition → abandonment of trade. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the paired objects in sand reweight identity and future work. Cost is felt—“lighter within that tempered regret could not diminish.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace, driftwood carvings, and grandfather’s tiny watch-hand carving function as micro-settings that constrain choice. The shore is not scenery; it is the archive Martin himself polluted, forcing confrontation. Temperature drops, tide rises, moonlight angles alter visibility—environment changes parallel internal shift. Final image—sand accepting both metal and wood—charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Martin bear the truth of his erased grandfather? Pressure tightens once: the unfamiliar carving appears, initials match, manufactured past collapses. No external antagonist; conflict is internal-external fusion of falsified archive vs. real artifact. Visible price: tomorrow he will close the business—path foreclosed on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance vs. invention—emerges through recurrent watch/hand imagery rather than statement. Subtext resides in silence: mother’s disappointment, grandfather’s unspoken forgiveness carved into wood. Final image reframes “sieved hush” as clarity rather than过滤的谎言. No moralizing; the tide simply reclaims what was always real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Close third-person interiority stays tight to Martin’s sensory filter: cool metal, rising bile, weathered stone. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens at recognition—“it was his grandfather’s handiwork.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction—“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”—is poetical but consistent with genealogist who sells poetry as pedigree.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for ritual (“Each carving held…”) give way to staccato recognition. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“traced,” “dug,” “burned”). Figurative layer disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Only nit: “sieved hush” repeated twice feels slightly self-conscious, but the second instance reweights meaning, so permitted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: black-market genealogist who forged heirlooms confronts a real one. Driftwood carvings as false memory landfill is novel world-building. Risk taken with lyric repetition of “sieved hush” pays off by closure. Not 9+ because premise could transfer to another craftsman with minor edits, but specificity of watch-hand lineage keeps it high.</comment>
