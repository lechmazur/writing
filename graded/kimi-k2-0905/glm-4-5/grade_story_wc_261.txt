<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “closure-seeker who reopens wounds” is declared repeatedly yet never dramatized; she never confronts a person whose scar she has probed. The moment she decides to stop seeking closure is reported, not embodied: “she realized she could stop seeking closure.” Plant-telepathy trait is label-only—no cost, contradiction, or sensory bleed. Interiority slips into self-diagnosis (“her accidental telepathy…always a gift and burden”) and therapeutic tag-lines, weakening contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure form is Earned Stasis: she renounces wound-opening and carries the miracle home, paying with her old identity. Causality is loose: coffee-ring “map,” hourglass glow, and wall-spirals simply reveal the tunnel rather than being tested or resisted. Orientation is clean—tower, dawn, after anesthesia—so the Orientation Test is waived. The miracle’s return does reconfigure her mission, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s “persistent constraint,” but the renunciation itself is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost feels announced rather than witnessed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tower and tunnel are sketched in chilly, tactile strokes (“sharp chill of stone,” “earth that hummed”); selective detail keeps the space legible. The hourglass and coffee cup serve as micro-settings that constrain the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate. Larger world-rules (how miracles get displaced, how time-tunnels obey physics) remain unestablished, but at this length economy is favored over exposition. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions—so no penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return the miracle/learn integration—arrives late and stays abstract; no concrete consequence is risked if she fails. Single meaningful tightening occurs when pressing the spiral stone opens the tunnel, but the act is effortless and unopposed, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Agency is present (she walks in, carries the miracle out), yet pressure plateaus at “gentle revelation” rather than escalating. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern deepens, but the lack of visible price keeps the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of “integration over excavation” emerges via recurring scar/ring/spiral imagery that culminates in her refusal to keep probing wounds. Subtext is thin—plants’ plea is spelt out—“Take us back…to before the tunnel separated us from the sun.” Final sentence states the new stance (“creator of new beginnings”), a mild thematic echo that blunts resonance. Nonetheless, the image-set is coherent and the insight is earned through concrete objects, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perceptions (“meteor hush,” “frosted hourglass”). Syntax flexes with altered states—compressed clauses mirror anesthesia fog. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal healing,” “conceptual repricing”) drifts above the POV’s plausible lexicon, but the rhythm remains controlled and the pattern is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Some scaffold: “The displaced miracle wasn’t lost; it was waiting…The displaced miracle pulsed ahead…” Metaphors stay coherent, though “housing a displaced miracle” is airy. Information density is moderate—several sentences do one job. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the piece above the 7.0 cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—mystic tower, time-tunnel, chosen guardian of wonder—is refreshed by botanical telepathy and coffee-ring cartography. The synthesis feels specific to Elara’s scar-reading vocation, making the reconfiguration plausible in hindsight. Risk is moderate: lyric meditation instead of action set-piece. Not transformative enough for the 8.5+ band, but the angle is non-obvious and emotionally grounded.</comment>
