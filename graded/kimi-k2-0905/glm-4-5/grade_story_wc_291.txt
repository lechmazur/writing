<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Elena’s synesthetic, face-blind perception is evoked vividly (“hands remembered what her eyes couldn’t”), but interiority drifts into self-exposition (“Today I will lance through…”) rather than embodied contradiction under threat. The assistant is deduced, never pressured, so the key relationship remains off-stage; Elena’s final stance costs her nothing on the page. Competence dominates over struggle—no misstep or visible flaw complicates the reveal. Methodical trait is asserted, not dramatized through costly micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a tidy off-stage confession triggered by a ribbon ID; the Decisive Change is reported, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual only (“justice dormant” line). Causal chain skips from inference to phone call to solved case, thinning because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear early; no meaningful tightening narrows Elena’s options—discovery feels cumulative, not hazardous. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds but lacks a charged final image that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Quarry mist and granite textures are filtered through Elena’s tactile bias; spatial layout remains coherent. Weather thickens to isolate, mirroring theme of forgotten memory. Setting never constrains the investigation—no tactical use of ledges, water, or fog to hide or reveal. Strong sensory specificity lacks a final environmental charge at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community empathy—stays abstract; on-page tension is the puzzle, not a live risk or sacrifice. Pressure plateaus after ribbon analysis; no visible price (time, safety, reputation) alters Elena’s tactics. Climax is cognitive, not consequential—options don’t narrow, knowledge simply arrives. Escalation is informational; cost is off-loaded to future confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of dormant empathy emerges through repeated “forgetting” imagery but is finally named by Elena rather than re-weighted by action. Subtext stays intellectual—no gesture or object carries ironic resonance. Insight is asserted in closing aphorism; ambiguity is limited because killer motive remains schematic. Particulars stay case-level rather than universal human contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, assured, and consistent in perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports the misty atmosphere. Free indirect style cleanly fuses external detail with Elena’s synesthetic lens. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. No head-hop or register drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence shapes, but metaphors occasionally layer without payoff (“furrowed hush” twice). Filter verbs are minimal; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Density is high, yet some clauses hedge action (“seemed to press in”) where strong verb would propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving cold case via ribbon texture is fresh; trope inversion gives new investigative lens. Quarry-as-forgotten-memory motif is familiar, but synesthetic method revitalizes it. Plot trajectory remains standard clue-to-confession; risk is stylistic, not structural. Specific perceptual detail prevents generic procedural feel.</comment>
