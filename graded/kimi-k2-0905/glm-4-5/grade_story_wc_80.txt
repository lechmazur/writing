<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The surveyor’s contradictory interior—stoic precision versus romantic archival hunger—drives every micro-choice (kneeling to measure, stripping to swim, sealing his own question into the mortar). His flaw-need fusion is palpable: the same instrument that maps shoreline drift also buries human ache, and the final act of pocketing the inkwell dramatizes the cost of carrying others’ ghosts. No diagnostic labels; body and tool concretize emotion throughout. The only bar to 9+ is that the climactic note is still a touch abstract—“dreams measured in increments”—rather than a sensory, irreversible forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the inkwell clicks shut, reweighting every prior capsule and transforming the pavilion from site to reliquary of longing. Causal chain holds—retrieval of metal box → decoding memory cubes → adding his own query → sealed inkwell—each step tightening his self-appointed archivist burden. Cost is visible and tactile: the inkwell “felt heavier,” shoulders ache under bag and dream-load. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of incremental burial intensifies until the final click crystallizes meaning without need for overt reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Submerged marble colonnades, bronze inkwell glare, cold water grip—each detail is filtered through surveyor’s professional eye and private ache. The inkwell functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final gesture (must seal before damp creeps in). Spatial choreography is flawless: drawbridge timetable, water level, stone footholds all tracked. One minor over-purple phrase—“hushed blaze of oranges and purples”—keeps it from 9.2, but the image still charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he bear the emotional mass of salvaged longing—tightens when he decides to add his own question, turning observer to contributor. Escalation is textural/density-driven: each recovered cube adds invisible mass; the inkwell’s final click is the decisive compression that forecloses his neutrality. Cost is felt (heavier bag, shivering meal), though not irrevocable—he could still walk away—so the tightening stops just short of 9-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges from concrete act: filling mortar with evacuated memories. Subtext lives in silence—the pavilion’s sigh, the click of bronze—rather than exposition. Final image reframes measurement itself as a burial practice, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Avoids tidy epiphany; ambiguity lingers about whether quantifying loss heals or compounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, melding cartographer precision with submerged melancholy: “contours of submerged walkways,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams.” Syntax lengthens under water-resistance, then tightens at click—rhythmic analogue to pressure release. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature remains consistent—quantities, angles, bronze weight—rooting grandeur in surveyed detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with action: long clauses drag through water, staccato snap at seal. Figurative language is spare and grounded—“marble pillars jutted like silent sentinels” is the most ornate, and it works. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected; information dual-loads (tool + memory + emotion) in single strokes. Register stays within surveyor’s plausible lexicon; only “hushed blaze” flirts with purple but is earned by sunset context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing coastal erosion science with memory-capsule poetics yields fresh angle on universal loss. Inkwell-as-portable-archive transforms standard relic into living archive tool; pavilion-as-drowned-dance-floor subverts ruin porn by making absence functional. Risk in second-person echo (“you” of tomorrow) is intentional temporal address, not gimmick, and crystallizes calling. Specificity prevents template drift—drawbridge timetable, cheese supper, bronze click—so premise feels discovered, not assembled.</comment>
