<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Elara’s desire to “interpret silence with empathy” is palpable and specific; her interiority is filtered through tactile map-work and frame-by-frame video obsession, not abstract labels. The moment she aligns the torn edge with the constellation path shows a micro-choice that costs her the certainty of a physical discovery and re-routes her goal to experiential preservation—an earned renunciation. Her flaw—over-investing in erased places—drives the climax and is not cured, only accepted. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the top band is just missed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the henge is not rebuilt but re-understood, and the map is mended to mark a threshold, not a gap—an irreversible re-weighting of knowledge with felt cost (“she would share her discovery, but in the same spirit of shielded openness”). Causal linkage holds: because she methodically compares silent footage, she spots the celestial pattern; because she spots it, she abandons the need to expose the site physically. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“rain-scoured fresco vault”). One lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds throughout; pressure escalates via density of pattern rather than external antagonist.</comment>

<comment>The rain-scoured vault itself functions as micro-setting: its dripping ceiling stains the frescoes and rhythms Elara’s attention, guiding her to seek what is erased rather than what remains. The torn map edge is handled twice—first as artifact, finally as threshold—charging the closure image. Celestial alignment is rendered through concrete photographic data, not cosmic purple prose. Spatial choreography is clean as Elara layers transparencies and realigns the map under the vault’s skylight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve mystery vs. reveal truth—tightens when the constellation pattern forces her to choose experiential silence over academic disclosure. Agency is exercised in the final act of mending the map to honor threshold rather than breach it; this renunciation carries visible cost (she forfeits professional acclaim). No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues through pattern recognition and the growing weight of empathy. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual guardianship of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as relationship, not possession. The refrain of “shielded openness” is never moralized but embodied in the final act of mending. The celestial chapel motif reweights from hidden building to lived experience, giving the reader a non-literal answer. No tidy maxim is stated; the after-effect is a hush rather than a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, mirroring a map framer’s precision: “methodically comparing silent video footage,” “overlays of shadow, vegetation, stone placement.” Syntax lengthens during discovery, then tightens into single-clause beats at the moment of renunciation. No dialogue appears; hence no voice convergence issue. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices absence (lost pigment, missing stones) more than presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rain-scoured fresco vault,” “whispered chapel,” each noun phrase doing double duty for atmosphere and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay physical—maps as windows, tears as thresholds—avoiding mixed logic. Final line cadence mirrors a map’s edge: short, serrated, final.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “lost monument” trope by making disappearance a celestial ritual rather than archaeological puzzle. Map framing as vocation is specific and lived: knife-pleasing precision, cotton gloves, acetate overlays. The reversal—that the chapel is sky, not stone—feels inevitable once the footage pattern is taught. Risk is taken by refusing physical revelation; coherence is maintained through empathetic silence.</comment>
