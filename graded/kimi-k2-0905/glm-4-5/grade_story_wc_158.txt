<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet’s interior contradiction—using sleeplessness to guard others’ dreams—anchors the piece, but the story never lets us see a moment where that contradiction buckles under pressure. All choices are reported, not dramatized; the one micro-choice that could have shown cost (the final surrender to sleep) is off-stage. Earned stasis is claimed (“to remain awake so others might rest”) yet never tested in scene, so the cap is 6.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical paragraph layers density until the shell itself sings. Closure is a Charged Poise—the poet’s death crystallizes the lullaby’s persistence—visible in “the lullabies continued…emanating from the shell’s very walls.” Cost is felt: the poet’s mortal exhaustion pays for the armistice. Orientation is late (who/where only implied by “gargantuan shell”) but the ambiguity serves the final cosmic reprise, so the waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shell-as-setting is never static: it curves, whispers, blooms, sings, and finally pulses light, each evolution causally tied to the poet’s verses. Micro-setting triumphs: the galaxy postcard pinned at the apex becomes the literal fulcrum of the final image. Sensory economy favors sound and bioluminescence, matching the insomnia motif. Specificity is high enough that removing any spatial detail would break the bloom sequence; this satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“can pain be photosynthesized into beauty that outlives the poet?”—is signaled early and tightened by each century-long bloom wave. Agency is oblique but present: every new blossom is a direct, irreversible outcome of the poet’s nightly singing, so the armistice deepens with visible biological cost (the poet’s wasting wakefulness). No reversal is required under the Accumulative lens; the pattern’s intensification is the escalation. The price is legible on the page: mortal exhaustion forecloses the poet’s own chance to dream.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image of reef-shadow joy—happiness that admits its own sorrow—without ever naming the paradox. The galaxy postcard’s cosmic indifference and the poet’s local tenderness reconfigure each other across centuries, achieving Conceptual Repricing: beauty is no longer redemption but shared insomnia. No moral is stated; the final line leaves the shell humming an off-key lullaby that reweights the premise. Minor deduction for one near-allegorical line (“this was never just flowers”) that almost spells the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, insomniac diction—“reef-shadow joy,” “shyly unstoppable march”—remains internally consistent and rhythmically varied, never drifting into purple excess. Perceptual signature is sharp: the poet clocks time by bloom-scent and wall-whisper, never by clock. Compression is taught early (“half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind”) and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated lexicon is justified by the cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only two adjacent sentences near the middle re-state the postcard’s journey with near-paraphrase (−0.2). Figurative language is patterned and purposeful: each bloom “swells” only after a lullaby, so metaphor obeys causal logic. Information density is high—every sentence adds texture or advances the bloom sequence. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the shell’s hum land cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of insomnia, lullaby, and bioluminescent blossom is a fresh synthesis that would collapse if any one image were swapped. Risk is bold: centuries pass in lyric pulses rather than scenes, yet the emotional through-line stays intact. The galaxy postcard literalizes interstellar mail without kitsch because its nebulae are unreadable constellations—cosmic illegibility as gift. Only the slightest whiff of familiar “lonely artist serves community” archetype keeps this from 9.0.</comment>
