<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her breath stabilizers racing against her pulse crystallizes the moment—but the “bravely conflicted” label is repeated instead of shown through fresh contradiction. The leap from loyal archivist to global whistle-blower happens in a single paragraph; we get no intermediate micro-choice that lets us feel the hinge inside her. Cost is named (cryonic suspension) yet not embodied before she sits down to wait, so the renunciation feels partly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: power fluctuation → thaw → read → transmit → wait for dawn. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by line 3. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the archive’s silence flips from oppressive to electric—yet the price (her life of service) is asserted more than dramatized on the final beat, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The cryo-library is tactile: amber-light frozen data, thermal suit hiss, archaic keyboard clatter. Cold is used as a constraint—fingers fly before frost slows them—so setting actively shapes tactics. The “echoing library under snow” refrain risks poetic over-repeat but is reweighted at the end when the same hush now “fills with revolutionary potential,” earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes are legible early: preserve vs. release contraband truth. One tightening beat—upload bar completes—forecloses reversal; cost is conceptual (Federation retribution) rather than visceral on-page, adequate for this length. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as living ice that must melt—emerges through image pattern rather than lecture. Final reconfiguration (“nothing could ever be frozen or hidden again”) reweights the opening freeze-frame without moralizing. The refrain “knowledge cries out to be free” flirts with thematic echo but is saved by Elena’s whispered solitude, not authorial assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter: she notices what an archivist would—amber-light, insignia, dormant network topology. Syntax lengthens under emotional surge then fractures into short uploads, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; corporate-Federation diction is kept outside her interior, preserving credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, mostly free of scaffold; however, “echoing library under snow” appears four times in 700 words, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls the final resonance. Mixed metaphors (“ripples spreading outward, touches of light in the darkness”) slightly muddy the frozen optic. Otherwise density is high and clauses propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The cryo-whistle-blower angle feels fresh, but the core beats—accidental discovery → moral upload → await doom—trace a familiar dystopian arc. Specificity of amber-frozen data and antique p2p networks lends novelty, yet the plot skeleton could transplant to any siloed future without breaking. Risk is present but not transformative; the concept carries more weight than the twist.</comment>
