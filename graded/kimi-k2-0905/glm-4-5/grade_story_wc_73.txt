<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid but drifts into self-diagnosis (“grim optimism hardened into resolve”) rather than embodied contradiction. The dice-as-talisman anchors micro-choices, yet Elias’s affective range narrows to perseverant climb without errant impulse testing his balanced daring. Closure choice is voiced rather than dramatized; we are told he now makes the bet, not shown the tremor of hand or recalibrated odds. Chipped corner as flaw-comrade is strong, but its psychological cost stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: hesitation → infinite staircase → proof-driven rupture → second chance. However, rupture is achieved by external formula, not a visible tactic we can trace in real time; the climax is summarized (“he activated the final sequence”). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dice roll now carries eternity’s memory—but the Decisive Change is reported, not staged. Orientation is clean early; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Infinite staircase is sketched with spatial economy—curving void, echoing steps—integrated into climbing action rather than catalogued. Dice function as micro-setting, their weight and click grounding bodily rhythm; chipped corner supplies tactile specificity that later “charges” rupture. Environment constrains choice by denying exit until the mathematical flaw is located, satisfying the 9+ gate. Light sensory imbalance: almost all detail is auditory or kinesthetic; visual palette is muted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—escape the staircase—signaled immediately. Pressure tightens once: discovery of fracture point narrows options to “activate now or keep climbing.” Protagonist agency is high in the plan, but the final activation beat is off-stage, softening felt cost. Conceptual price (eternity’s weight on the dice) is legible in closure image, meeting 8-band threshold, yet physical risk or irrevocable loss is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of chance vs. determinism emerges through dice motif and mathematical proof, avoiding explicit sermon. Subtextual irony: the imperfect die becomes the key, not the perfect one—nice wink at randomness defeating infinity, but story articulates the irony for us. Final laugh is earned, but weight of “texture of possibility” is asserted, not left to reverberate. Complexity stays moderate; no counter-reading destabilizes the wager.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains rhythmic climb cadence, echoing steps in sentence pulses. Diction gravitates toward abstract lexicon (“mathematical proofs that might rupture confinement”) that slightly overshoots Elias’s probable education level, creating mild register drift. Perceptual signature—numbers, vectors, perpetual-motion idiom—is consistent, but voice does not modulate under peak stress; rupture passage uses same tempo as earlier ascent. No dialogue to test naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Propulsive sentence variety and clean grammar; occasional scaffold loops (“infinite staircase…endless…boundless confinement”) repeat high-concept adjectives without new angle. Mixed metaphors avoided; metaphors are spare, e.g., “sound like shattering glass.” Information density dips in mid-paragraph reflections where equations are named but not dramatized. No line artifacts obstruct rupture clarity, but final beat skips the tactile moment we crave.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purgatory-as-Möbius-staircase is fresh enough, and welding chance icon (dice) to deterministic escape (proof) yields a non-obvious synthesis. Conceptual risk: climax relies on abstract formula rather than embodied ingenuity, edging toward trope of genius-instant-solution. Eternal-return casino finale re-weights earlier material with satisfying circularity. Specific detail—chipped corner geometry—prevents generic feel. Execution safe rather than audacious; could have gambled voice or structure.</comment>
