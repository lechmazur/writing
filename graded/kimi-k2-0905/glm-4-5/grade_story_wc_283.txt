<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet solitude and methodical care give her a believable spine, but her interiority never cracks under pressure; the prophecy arrives as feeling, not friction, so her shift from observer to communal guide feels smooth rather than costly. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply decides to share—so the “earned” turn leans on assertion, not visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the warehouse becomes a center of shared wisdom, reweighting the premise. Causality is soft—buttons patterning into prophecy is more associative than because/therefore—but the accumulative lens is taught early and holds; the final communal glow carries undeniable social cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, cliff-shadows, and shifting grains create a tactile, enclosed mood; micro-setting works—the buttons function as tactile “text” that constrains decoding choices. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s curator eye; the canyon echo’s jar reappears to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—transform rigid prophecy into malleable future—remains abstract; pressure heightens by accumulation (more buttons, more visitors) rather than a narrowing choice with felt price. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no single beat forces a trade-off, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Shared wisdom emerges organically from the button-archive; no character sermonizes. The ending image—visitors feeding lost buttons into the pattern—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite mid-band abstraction.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance sustains a hushed, curator-perceptual signature; diction stays within Elara’s quiet register. No dialogue to test voice divergence; rhythmic repetition (“amber warehouse beneath the cliffs”) is patterned and pays off in the final glow, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses in measured cadences; sentence variety is good, information density high. Occasional template stem (“as the…”) appears three times but does not cluster in peak beats; no metaphor muddle. Closure image is clean, propelling the reweighting without scaffolding, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Hourglass-turner + canyon-echo prophecy via button-catalogue is a fresh synthesis; emotional truth centers on quiet stewardship rather than heroicChosenOne. The concept commits fully, and the communal reconfiguration feels inevitable; risk is moderate, originality solid but not breathtaking.</comment>
