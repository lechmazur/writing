<comment>Elara’s “first-name basis with death” underwrites her calm analytic posture and supplies a believable motive for the quest; every beat of her inspection of the snow globe shows micro-choices that embody that detachment while letting grief leak through. Interiority stays concrete (“water droplets rolling down like tears” is felt, not labelled). The final realization—“death is a frequency shift”—is an earned conceptual renunciation that forecloses her old need for corporeal proof and carries visible emotional cost (the plane vanishes in the globe). What keeps this from 9-band is that the library itself never pressures her tactics; she could have had the epiphany in any quiet room, so the crucible is mental, not environmental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural pattern holds cleanly: repeated, increasingly charged inspections of the snow-globe miniatures tighten the emotional aperture until the object re-prices its own meaning. Closure is an unmistakable CR beat—“now the plane was gone entirely”—that forces an irreversible re-think of both Amelia’s words and Elara’s grief. The orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (sunken library, snow globe in hand). What blocks 9+ is that the only persistent external constraint (deep-sea pressure) remains ornamental; it never shapes tactics or exacts a price, so the cost is purely conceptual rather than physical or relational.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Pressure-blind ocean outside the window and the “massive oak table” under miles of seawater create a tactile, impossible space that is credibly lived-in: Elara sets the globe on that table, wipes water from the glass, hears her footfalls echo. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices exact angles and miniature kanji, not tourist décor. However, the environment never physically constrains her (she could as easily be in a dry vault), so it supports atmosphere more than choice; that caps the score below 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—tightens through each re-viewing of the globe; the final re-reading of “home” as frequency state rather than island is a decisive conceptual tightening. Agency is intellectual (attention, re-naming) but the cost is felt: she weeps for the first time since taking the job, signalling the emotional price. One hairline slip: no external pressure complicates her task; she succeeds on the first try, so escalation is emotional, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through recurrence and re-weighting: “home” moves from cartography to metaphysics, letting the reader feel how grief might be a tuning problem rather than a place. The lesson is never sermonised; the only explicit “physics of letting go” line sits mid-text and is quickly overwritten by the final image. Sophisticated melancholy is sustained throughout, and the final vanishing of the plane offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s analytic register: concrete measurements (“exact position… tiny Japanese letters”) and mechanical metaphors (“frequency shift”) keep voice idiom consistent. Compression is taught early (“Cut all but one frequency… home”) and paid off when the ellipsis is re-filled. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; interior monologue avoids cliché. Rhythm modulates—long calm sentences for observation, fragment-like repetitions as insight crests. Slight over-exactness in register (“conceptual repricing”) grazes academic diction once, not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence either advances inspection, supplies sensory anchor, or layers the globe motif. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor stays consistent (water = barrier). Opening and closing lines are sharp—first anchors place, last recharges object. A single mixed image (“melancholy… beautiful in its clarity”) is minor; it neither obscures causality nor dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—Amelia’s final word as metaphysical travel advisory—feels fresh and is grounded in a single recovered prop rather than alt-history sprawl. The sunken-library frame supplies an unforgettable, non-generic stage. The synthesis of spiritualism with hard-science diction (“frequency shift”) creates a singular tone. Risk: the concept could feel thesis-driven, but specificity of the miniature kanji and the vanishing plane keep it narrative, not treatise.</comment>
