<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity is shown through tactile beats (tracing squares, pocketing journal) and a single interior contradiction—he craves solitude yet hungers for mentor approval—embodied in the final line. Cost is present but light: a racing heart and the abstract forfeiture of secrecy. The dog-eared phrasebook re-appears as micro-choice, anchoring trait to action. Still, no genuine flaw complicates his success; diligence alone drives the win.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: starlings → hopscotch cipher → phrasebook → containment insight, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the airship becomes “repository of ancient knowledge,” re-weighting Eli’s world. Cost is intellectual rather than visceral—future burden of proof implied, not felt. Orientation clean by 120 words; single-scene default met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Airship deck, hopscotch board, and trapped beam are sketched with selective sensory strokes (dusty squares, flicker against birds). Micro-setting works: the board’s physical sequence literally constrains Eli’s decoding movements. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible shifts. Environment could bite harder—wind, altitude risk, or social stakes—to push the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is signaled early and tightened when the cipher re-weights his goal from search to proof. Agency is intellectual: pattern-matching, sketching, deciding to re-hide the board. No external antagonist or bodily risk, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Cost is conceptual (burden of new knowledge), satisfying the lens but not viscerally charging the image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: pattern-seeking humans and nature both obey hidden geometries. Subtext lives in the starlings’ wordless choreography mirroring Eli’s private epiphany. Final image of “luminous mysteries” invites reflection without moralizing. No late thematic echo; resonance stays modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: light “stranded,” numbers “worn,” phrasebook “well-thumbed.” Syntax loosens slightly under excitement—“his heart racing”—but stays within lexicon. No dialogue to test distinction. Free-indirect ticks (“his meticulously curious nature prevented…”) edge toward explanatory filter yet remain character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid scaffold. Occasional softeners (“seemed suspended,” “something about it resonated”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors; technical terms (luminance, cipher) used accurately. High-band gate missed because figurative language never risks real strangeness or compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of hopscotch, starling murmuration, and celestial navigation feels fresh and specific to this world. Premise could drift toward puzzle-box cliché yet stays grounded in apprentice-scale stakes. No bold structural risk, but synthesis is memorable. Transformation test passes: swap elements and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
