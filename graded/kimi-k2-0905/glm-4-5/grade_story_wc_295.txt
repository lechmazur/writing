<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her noticing lens is trained on “glass dome,” “clipboard,” “daylily-pressed telegram,” anchoring her as a lucid-dream astronomer. The flaw is passivity: she never makes a risky micro-choice; the decoding breakthrough happens *to* her through star-alignment and Thorne’s arrival. The emotional arc is a smooth rise from private torment to shared relief, but because she does not *pay* anything or refuse an alternative, the cost is only felt, not dramatized. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to keep her above the mid-line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “understanding dawned completely” reweights the telegram and temple dreams, turning isolation into collaboration with visible emotional cost (“satisfaction of a quest fulfilled”). Causality under the Accumulating/Textural lens coheres—each night-dream layer adds density until the variable-star pattern breaks the code. The single weakness is that the decisive turn is off-stage in the gap between Elara’s solo telescope moment and Thorne’s entrance; we witness the result, not the irreversible micro-choice. Nevertheless, the final image crystallizes options and meaning, satisfying the 9+ quick test for closure with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory dome, telescope lens, and pressed daylilies are tactile, POV-filtered, and return to charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clean: clipboard set down, lens adjusted, telegram placed between them. Environment guides choice—only the dome’s telescopes allow the star-pattern discovery. What keeps this from 8.8 is that the setting never *constrains* Elara; access is never threatened or limited, so the final image is charged but not shaped by a physical trade-off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the temple inscriptions to recover lost healing wisdom—is signaled early and tightens once: “never been more urgent.” The meaningful deepening is the star-pattern glyph match that narrows options from “endless mystery” to “legible language.” Agency is diluted because the pattern is revealed by celestial coincidence, not a risky decision; still, Elara chooses to *share* the burden, foreclosing solo possession of the power. Cost is present but abstract—loss of sole ownership rather than tangible loss—keeping it solidly mid-7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is completed only through communal risk, not solitary genius. The daylily telegram’s early fragility versus its final authority reweights “distant places” into intimate trust. Subtext operates in gesture—placing the telegram *between* them on the table silently transfers guardianship. No moral is stated; the resonant image is the shared silence under dawn light. The concept is coherent but not startlingly fresh, holding it just below the 8-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control: “daylily-pressed telegram…smelled of distant places” marries scent to metaphor without purple overflow. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices in astronomer cadences: “variable stars whose fluctuating brightness patterns…” Compressed diction under pressure (“Understanding was dawning”) mirrors the celestial click. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift into soft lyricism is voice-motivated, keeping the read-aloud ear engaged. Distinctive enough to crest 8.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density—single sentences telescope time and emotion: “For weeks, the same recurring vision had tormented her.” Figurative language is selective; mixed metaphor is avoided. Loops are minimal, but repeated “understanding dawning” phrasing in narrative and dialogue creates a faint template cadence (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat. Paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph would erase needed knowledge or charge. Clean grammar and tense control throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lucid-dream astronomer who heals with translated star-glyphs is a fresh synthesis of two tired tropes. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure rather than plot twists. Specificity—daylily telegram, variable-star cipher—prevents swap-with-names test failure. Yet the emotional arc is safe: isolation→shared burden→quiet triumph, a middle-path payoff that avoids darker cost. Fresh angle is evident but not bold enough to breach 7.0.</comment>
