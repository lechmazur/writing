<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lillian’s quietly-savvy trait is embodied early—she reads the desktop’s disorder while chatting—and her micro-movement to swap the jar is crisp. The “golden-hour portrait thief” label is illustrated rather than asserted, and the final renunciation (she becomes a historian, not thief) carries visible cost. Interiority is mostly concrete, though “her destiny wasn’t to steal light but to preserve it” edges diagnostic; still, prior causality supports it. One contradictory impulse moment (wanting vs. guarding light) would sharpen 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A single continuous scene under causal lens; every beat is linked by therefore/because logic (flowers → access → jar → revelation). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s re-illumination of portraits reweights her vocation with undeniable social cost—she now curates, not sells. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 40 words; no ambiguity. The only nit: causality is straight, not knotted—one more tightening turn would lift to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emerald tiles, marble counter, swirling silver light are selective, tactile, atmosphere-first. The station’s spatial layout stays coherent across the lift. Environment does not physically constrain her escape (no locked doors, alarms), so the 9-gate isn’t met, yet the glowing tiles mirror and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the jar) does constrain choice—its glow must be hidden—so full 8-band earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the constellation of stolen portraits—surfaces early. Tightening occurs when the jar’s internal light reveals hidden signatures, foreclosing resale and reframing her goal from acquisition to curation; cost is conceptual (she forfeits criminal profit). Escalation is single-step but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal complicates her path. To breach 8.8 a tangible loss (tool, alliance, time) on the page would be needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “illuminated moments” emerges through the jar’s literal re-illumination of prior thefts, not commentary. Subtext lives in silences: stationmaster never sees the swap, flowers speak for her. Final image crystallizes meaning without moralizing. The insight feels earned, though a touch more ambiguity (is preservation purer than theft?) could deepen complexity and nudge higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked; perceptual signature is painterly-light-obsessed, diction “luminous disbelief,” “melted gold” is purposeful, not purple. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences at golden hour, clipped moves during lift. Dialogue is minimal but voice-apt; stationmaster’s weary diction contrasts with Lillian’s internal shimmer. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Elision pattern (time jump from lift to workshop) is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud ear: syntax varies, no template cadence. Density is high—single sentences layer light, color, and motive. Figurative language is restrained until peak beat, then “liquid silver light” is apt, not mixed. One scaffold loop: “golden-hour portrait thief” phrase repeated three times; costs −0.2 but never touches closure. Otherwise scaffolding cut, momentum sustained. A single typo-free, clean proof.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: art-heist + light-preservation curator; trope is flipped, not decorated. Specific detail (flower code learned in Kyoto) grounds world. Risk—quiet heist without chase—pays off because conceptual reprice lands. Not quite 9.0 because premise, while original, still recognizable as heist; one more irreplaceable world rule (why portraits reveal only under moonbeam light) would secure uniqueness band.</comment>
