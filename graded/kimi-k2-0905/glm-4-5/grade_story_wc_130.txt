<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored (“fingers tracing chipped patterns,” “buried optimism surged”), but the mentor-shaped void is declared rather than dramatized; the single micro-choice—ritual continuation—lacks a palpable fork or forfeiture, so the change feels incremental rather than costly. The glass-eye vision supplies a flicker of earned contradiction, yet Elara’s flaw/blind spot remains theoretical, muting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each stalactite drip and shifting mosaic tile thickens the emotional density toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is swift (who/where/by-word-80). The final image—the stone’s new constellation—reconfigures the mentor search without solving it, leaving a felt conceptual cost: every future ritual will be read through this fresh pattern. No causality breaks, though the drip-time ellipsis is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic clock: drip-rate modulates tension and literally feeds the light-fruit that fuels the magic. The chipped mosaic stepping stone is handled thrice—setup, mid-trace, final re-pattern—each touch altering tactical options. Spatial choreography is clean; body crouch, knee pressure on stone, eye-level sightlines track without drift. The bioluminescent fruit dimming supplies a living light meter, charging the final image when the stone, not the fruit, becomes the last light source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“can emotion be mathematized to recover mentor?”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: drip cadence slows, tile constellation shifts, glass eyes ignite; these accumulations tighten the emotional aperture rather than narrow external options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—tomorrow’s ritual will be read through tonight’s new pattern—landing as Resonant Reconfiguration. No external antagonist or tangible loss, so pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; sufficient for 600-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Mathematics of emotion” begins as abstract thesis but crystallizes into the tactile act of finger-tracing sorrow-equations on stone; theme emerges through this conflation of logic and grief. The chipped constellation reprises as both map and scar, reweighting loss from void to ongoing equation. No moral statement—closure is image, not maxim—allowing plausible counter-readings: hope or delusion. Subtext lives in the glass eyes’ unreadable stare, dramatizing the gap between pattern and meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited sustains a lush, mineral-tinged diction (“bioluminescent fruits,” “mineral-rich drops”) that mirrors cavern saturation. Syntax lengthens under ritual intensity, then fractures into em-dash vision bursts, mirroring cognitive flux. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; register stays within Elara’s arcane lexicon. Filter verbs (“seemed to hold”) are minimal and voice-motivated, maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between stalactite drip cadence (short, liquid clauses) and ritual incantation (long, accumulative stacks); no template cadence detected. Metaphors are geologically consistent—water, stone, light—avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “buried optimism” is named twice without fresh embodiment; minor. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, magical rule, and emotional valence. Closure line crystallizes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “mathematics of emotion” angle reframes standard grief-magic through a taxidermist’s glass eyes—an object at once forensic and necromantic—giving fresh friction to conjurer trope. Cavern orchard is not Wonderland scenery but a hydraulic logic engine whose drip-rate equals emotional tempo, an inventive fusion of geology and psyche. Mentor-vanish remains off-stage, leaning on familiar ambiguous-loss template, preventing higher band. Still, the final star-map pattern feels inevitable yet un-guessed, satisfying the hindsight test.</comment>
