<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—her “gift of heightened perception” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The seasonal muteness is a striking constraint, yet we never see it force a moment of visible cost or tactical change; it’s ornamental. The final image of the sculpture pulsing new colors is beautiful, but the emotional cost is implied rather than felt on the page. The arc is one of steady devotion rather than transformation, so the Earned Stasis is credible, but the absence of a wrenching contradiction keeps her just short of memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-tuning session and color display adds density until the final spectrum reweights the community’s communicative world. Orientation is swift—who, where, when locked by line three. The iceberg fragment’s arrival at ~150 words is the single tightening beat that pivots from maintenance to creation; this deepening is decisive. Closure is a Charged Poise: the never-before-seen spectrum at Elara’s death crystallizes the stakes without verbal exposition, paying the cost in wonder rather than loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispering bluff above the clouds is evoked through sonic and optic detail—vibrations, overtones, refracted dawns—rather than postcard vistas. The tower’s interior is sketched only as needed: crystal strings, mirrors, the fragment’s thousand-color spectrum, all filtered through Elara’s tuner senses. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; bodies never teleport. The setting’s micro-climate (silence, altitude, light) directly shapes the invention of the sculpture, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining her materials and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve wonder via color-sound—is signaled early and pursued with monastic consistency, but pressure never escalates through trade-off or risk. No resource is depleted, no opposition appears, no alternative path is foreclosed; the tension is aesthetic, not tactical. The iceberg fragment complicates by inspiration, not obstacle. Cost is displaced onto the community’s evolving language, not Elara’s immediate circumstances, so escalation remains gentle and intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: communication transcends speech through shared sensory wonder. The return of color-spectrum at death reweights the premise—wonder becomes immortalized collective memory—without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence itself; the muteness that once isolated now unites. The story resists the temptation to declare “truth is light”; instead, the final image performs that equation, letting the reader feel the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The third-person lyric voice sustains a bell-like cadence—long resonant sentences, metallic consonants, chromatic diction—matching the tuner’s ear. No dialogue appears, so voice convergence is irrelevant. POV modesty is perfect: the narrator never exceeds Elara’s sensorium. Psychic distance tightens only at the death scene, a deliberate final zoom that crystallizes the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the sound-light fusion rather than decorating emptily. Rhythm varies—from echoing anaphora to single-clause fragments mimicking struck overtones. No loops or synonym churn detected; “glisten” recurs only with earned thematic weight. A single strained image—“inspiration struck with the force of revelation”—is the lone purple moment, not repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synaesthetic linguistics and mythic solitude feels fresh; the “iceberg fragment from the upper atmosphere” is a surreal yet internally lawful catalyst. Turning seasonal muteness from handicap to perceptual superpower subverts disability tropes without sermonizing. The kinetic color-sculpture as universal translator is a conceptual risk that lands because the story commits fully to its optical syntax. None of this could swap places with another fable without collapsing its entire sensory engine.</comment>
