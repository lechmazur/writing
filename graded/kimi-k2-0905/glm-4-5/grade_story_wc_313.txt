<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The warden’s quietly obsessive caretaking and the photograph-triggered pivot to activist feel credible; his aunt’s single photo gives him a heritable flaw that collides with duty, and the final phone-calls show concrete micro-choices. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than diagnostic, though a touch of summary (“he understood then what he must do”) nudges him off the highest rung.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn light on rooftops crystallizes a new public stance whose cost is legible—he forfeits the official story he has policed. Causal chain (label → photo trail → aunt recognition → decision) holds; only the wind-chime device is slightly convenient, not decisive. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; one seamless time-lapse to dawn keeps the shard count legal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ridge-way body-as-setting steers every vantage; the sapphire label and the emerging rooftops act as micro-setting props that literally constrain what can be seen or retrieved. Sensory selection (violet/indigo twilight, mirrored hush) is POV-true and echoes interior stillness. One nit: no tactile detail of mud or smell of silt on the exposed town—minor but keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—tightens once: the photo of his aunt forces him to abandon his sanctioned narrative. Escalation is sufficient for lyric/accumulative design; cost is present but internal, so felt yet not sharply painful on the page. Coincidence (label intact, wind chime hush) complicates rather than rescues, acceptable under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from watery re-emergence versus suppressed history; no explicit sermon, just the rooftop light reframing complicity as shared memory. Subtext in the silent wind-chime and mirrored hush offers a non-literal answer about who gets to speak after disaster. The final image avoids moralizing while still enacting a conceptual re-pricing of “progress.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited maintains a weathered, patient cadence that matches a thirty-year watcher; perceptual signature (precise reservoir grammar, color-slant of twilight) stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One soft spot: “precisely humane” is author-narrated rather than shown through idiosyncratic thought, barely clipping the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the ebb of water; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer (“mirrored hush,” “violet and indigo”) is sparse and purposive—does not flood key beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge without scaffolding. Minor: “thirty years” and “decades-long” echo faintly; not enough to dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Resurfaced reservoir town has been used, yet the fusion of warden’s custodial precision with buried photo-insurgency feels fresh. Specificity of sapphire label and wind-chime silence particularizes the frame, and the quiet dawn address to future memory avoids triumphalism. Could tip higher if the aunt’s activism had been foreshadowed by one object in opening paragraph.</comment>
