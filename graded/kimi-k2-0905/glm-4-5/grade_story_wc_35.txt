<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s sensory curse and his self-devised coping ritual give him a sharp, need-driven interior life; every beat is filtered through taste-as-memory. The contradictory pull—seek more remorse to blunt remorse—drives every micro-choice without explicit self-diagnosis. His trembling hands at the end embody visible cost, earning the shift from hollow to “lighter.” The only missed opportunity: we never feel a live relationship under pressure; the fortress folk remain background furniture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: Kael steps out lighter because he has metabolized communal regret, a decisive inner change. Causality inside the pavilion is lyric/accumulative rather than tight “because-therefore”; the sand reveals stairs when Kael “reads” it, a quasi-magical leap not fully seeded. Early orientation is swift—chef, desert fort, post-rain—but the dream frame (“close of an unspoken dream”) stays abstract and never re-weights the ending, so the dream cue feels ornamental. Still, the final lens is coherent: the pattern is “taste → absorb → refine → emerge changed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—brittle walls, coral ice gleaming in desert heat—keeps the impossible pavilion tactile. The tidal pools function as both micro-setting and oracle, literally guiding Kael’s feet; removing them would break the entry beat. Weather (unseasonable rain) enables the entire plot and is felt on skin, not declared. One minor over-description: “glistening remnants” repeats the rain idea within two lines, a small slackening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake is declared early: Kael must enter the pavilion and sandpaper remorse. Pressure escalates through sensory overload—each tasted memory threatens to drown him—rather than external opposition; this is Accumulative/Textural escalation. The visible cost is his trembling hands, evidence that the tasting has physically depleted him. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the tension is endurance-based, sufficient for the lyric mode but not option-closing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The theme—remorse as edible, refinable material—emerges entirely through sensory action, never thesis-statement. The closing image of Kael lighter after ingesting collective grief reweights the premise without moralizing. Tidal pools and coral ice form a quiet motif of fragile structures holding hidden memory, but they are not forced; each returns only when needed to advance access or embody the idea. Avoids tidy moral; the cost is felt in his tremor, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Kael’s tongue and skin; perception is filtered through culinary vocabulary (“seasoning a dish”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with his sensory flood, compressing under overload. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is N/A. The only drift is one elevated clause—“repository of stored remorse”—which momentarily sounds like curatorial plaque rather than chef-thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the beats: long reflective sentences build, then shorten when Kael touches the pool. Figurative layering is dense (“sandpaper rough memories”) but consistent with the chef-tool lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “brittle walls… brittle nature” within three sentences; a -0.2. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Closure image is clean, tactile, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef + crystalline remorse pavilion is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once tasted. Tidal-pool fortune-telling converts environmental science into magical cartography without exposition. Risk is high—concept could slide into preciousness—but is grounded by culinary grit and bodily cost. Removing any core image would collapse the whole; the concept is inseparable from its sensory engine.</comment>
