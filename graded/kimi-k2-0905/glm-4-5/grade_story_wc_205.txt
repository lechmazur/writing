<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s poetically inclined interiority is vivid and embodied (“traced his fingers”, “whispered to the shard”), but the decisive shift to public peacemaker relies on a single overnight writing sprint whose causal steps are summarized, not dramatized; the cost is asserted (“burned brighter”) rather than shown through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the manuscript reweights the dispute from binary truth to shared myth-making, with felt social cost implied by the astonished delegates. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each lyrical return to the shard thickens meaning—but the leap from solitary writing to collective acceptance is elided, softening the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is evoked through kinetic detail (“spiraling gold filigree obscured cave-like dwellings”, “floating libraries”) that guides Elias’s clandestine movements; the crystal shard functions as micro-setting, constraining his posture at the desk and charging the final image when it passes between factions. Temporal storms mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can a new narrative prevent violence?—is signaled early and tightens when Elias commits to writing during the storm. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal: each paragraph adds density until the manuscript becomes the irreversible stake. Cost is conceptual (abandonment of absolute truth) but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically: civilizations, like vases, can fracture and still refract beauty. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of gathered delegates silently holding the shard reconfigures the meaning of breakage from shame to shared origin. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Elias’s perceptual signature—poetic, tactile, synesthetic—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long, incense-laden sentences swell during reflection, then fracture into shorter units as dawn approaches. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction remains within the lexicon of a fallen poet-revolutionary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea (“burnished sorrow of their shared history”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) is earned by the baroque lens and does not dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “visible Time” conceit freshens the familiar peacemaker arc; the shard’s transformation from evidence to mythic mirror feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the lyric accumulation structure, but coherence holds. Specificity of the asteroid’s architecture and temporal storm physics prevents generic drift.</comment>
