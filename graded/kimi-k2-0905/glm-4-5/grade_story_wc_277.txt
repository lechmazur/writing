<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motivation is legible—finish father’s work, clear Davies—but interiority drifts into label-speak (“devotedly observant eyes,” “hierarchy of values”) that blurs embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows her flaw or cost; the turn from regret to justice is declared, not dramatized. The rosewood nib is handled, yet never alters her tactics or betrays a limit. Closure choice is summary, not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal spine holds: journalist call → retreat to observatory → proof by contradiction → dawn phone call. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a declared decision, not a dramatized act; cost is asserted (“symbol of her commitment”) rather than felt. Because the decisive external action (calling the journalist) is off-page, the Decisive Change is only half-rendered.</comment>

<comment>The echoing observatory is vividly sketched—curved walls, star dome, childhood desk—and filters through Eleanor’s nostalgic lens. Rosewood nib and celestial maps supply tactile micro-setting that guides her document spread. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room gaps. Setting never actively constrains her choices or charges the final image, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—expose the real corrupter and clear Davies—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via mental deduction beats, but each “contradiction” is narrated rather than tested in scene; no live obstacle raises the cost. The final narrowing (“exactly how the story would end”) is summary, not a foreclosed option with visible price. Stakes remain intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited obligation versus objective truth emerges through Eleanor’s use of her father’s method. Subtext is thin: no gap between what she says and what she risks. Final line moralizes (“most powerful intervention is showing people…”) rather than reweighting prior images. The rosewood nib and orbits motifs recur but do not shift meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays stable and carries a faint archaic formality suited to a Winthrop heir. Rhythm is controlled; sentences vary without mechanical pattern. Diction slips into elevated filler (“orbits of determination,” “playful solemnity”) that feels writerly rather than character-bound. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal monologue is coherent if slightly self-conscious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, largely free of loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“devotedly observant eyes,” “echoing observatory above clouds”) edge toward purple but don’t stall momentum. No grammar errors or pronoun drift. Information density is moderate; several beats could compress without loss. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Combining astronomical sanctuary, investigative heiress, and proof-by-contradiction gives a fresh gloss on the classic corruption expose. Yet the deduction remains off-stage, the frame is mostly inherited rather than invented, and the rosewood nib never acquires unique agency. Risk level is moderate; execution competent but not transformative.</comment>
