<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The visionary’s interiority is rich—“root-bound” bodily metaphor, contradictory dread/exhilaration—but their motivations stay abstract; no concrete flaw or hierarchy of values is tested. Micro-choices are present (touching scars, stepping into the maze) yet lack differentiated cost; the final insight is prompt-level paraphrase rather than embodied realization. Still, the single psyche is vividly drawn and consistent within its lyric register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual re-pricing: covenant redefined, visionary freed from self-bind. Causal chain is loose—scars=map is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (scar-touch → light → maze regrows) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; future-early rule stays fuzzy yet charges the final image enough to satisfy short-form RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt glade, dusk light, and the topiary-as-micro-setting are rendered with selective, sensory economy; color motif threads through every beat and constrains visibility inside the maze. Spatial logic is clean; scale shift to miniature is accepted fantasy cue. While world-rules of “Dreamers/Watchers” remain abstract, environment is concretely leveraged to guide choice and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore covenant or drown in premature future”—is declared early; pressure deepens via maze-reconstruction ritual. Escalation is tonal (anxious elation intensifies) rather than option-narrowing; no tangible loss is shown. Agency is present but abstract; cost is felt conceptually at closure, meeting minimal short-form threshold under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: dreams and reality must cohabit, not separate. Recurrent cobalt/blue imagery reweights at exit; no moralizing speech. Idea stays tied to concrete sensory objects (topiary, light-threads) rather than thesis statements, inviting post-read reflection without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains cobalt palette and ritual cadence; diction stays within visionary’s symbolic lexicon. Patterned repetition (“anxious elation,” “root-bound”) is deliberate, taught early, paid off in final smile. No dialogue to test naturalism; prose rhythm modulates with ritual pacing, remaining coherent and texture-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is mostly varied; some template cadence (“they… they… they…”) and abstract latinate nouns (“visionary,” “covenant”) flatten immediacy. Figurative language is coherent but dense in climax—no contradictory metaphors. Loops are minor; information density is adequate; final image lands cleanly. Would benefit from pruning scaffold phrases (“they realized,” “they understood”) to tighten under 800-word limit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise—future arriving early, covenant via scar-map—offers fresh mythic angle on dream/reality merge. Execution relies on familiar ritual arc but uses specific color palette and topiary metaphor to avoid generic fantasy templates. Transformation is conceptual, yet stakes feel particular to this glade. Risk in abstract stakes is moderate; specificity of cobalt maze keeps it memorable.</comment>
