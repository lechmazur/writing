<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip on the ink pot, the tremor as she dials the safe—but the “mathematics of a fair trade” is declared twice without being dramatized in a micro-choice. The father–daughter contradiction is present yet never collides in-scene; we’re told she refuses his path rather than shown a live temptation. Still, her embodied emotions and the visible cost of job-loss risk keep her credibly flawed and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because her father forged, therefore she owns the pot; because the guard vanishes at 2:17, therefore she breaches. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns the pot now reflecting “possibility of redemption,” a conceptual re-pricing that carries undeniable social cost (job, prison). The safe-cracking beat is dramatized, not summarized, and the price is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The funeral prep room is more than wallpaper: the chemical scent, stainless tables, and 2:17 security clock constrain her stealth tactics and supply the asylum seal. The ink pot operates as micro-setting—its silver rim and impossible swirls directly guide her decision-making, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible positions.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—her security vs. Thorne’s life—tightens once: the safe clicks and her tremor makes the price visceral. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient at this length; no reversal is needed. Cost is visible on-page: the heavy seal’s weight and the returned pot’s altered reflection foreclose her prior innocence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: tools of deception repurposed for life-saving truth. The ink pot’s shifted reflection reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image offers quiet ambiguity—redemption possible yet unpaid—resisting tidy thesis. No echo-statements or final-paragraph morals.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Maya’s perceptual filter—her father’s “inspiration well,” the hum of refrigeration. Syntax is controlled, no head-hopping. One register slip: “deathly vitality” is repeated like a label instead of being rendered through sensory texture, but it doesn’t contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, no loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances goal or texture. Strong verbs (“yielded,” “dialed,” “charged”) and concrete nouns (“embalming tables,” “silver surface”). One mixed metaphor—“liquid thoughts” beside “mathematics”—but it doesn’t blur causality. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the breach, then exhales at the return of the pot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral-home forgery+asylum rescue via enchanted ink pot is non-obvious. The pot’s liquefaction of thought is a fantastical yet understated twist that powers tactics. Familiar “child of con artist goes straight” trope is reanimated through mortuary stakes and dissident-science angle. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
