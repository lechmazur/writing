<comment>Elara’s “salvage something pure” motive is declared repeatedly but never put at risk; she never hesitates, sacrifices, or jeopardizes her safety. The interiority stays at poetic label level—“she felt the lingering presence”—rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices are missing: she simply “descended,” “found,” “documented,” “began visiting,” each step narrated rather than dramatized. The captain’s gratitude is the only cost acknowledged, but it is projected onto him, not paid by her.</comment>

<comment>Closure is present: the captain’s spirit is freed (Resonant Reconfiguration) and the descendants choose disclosure, both legible on-page. Causality is soft-threaded; the snow globe’s dream-mechanic is asserted, not tested or constrained, so the tightening feels ornamental rather than tactical. Orientation is clean—glacier shrine, wreck site, timeline all anchored within 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeating dream fragments accrue until public revelation; pattern holds but lacks a felt price from Elara herself.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory detail—“frigid waters,” “coral-encrusted beams,” “candles flickered”—efficiently sketches submerged ruin and ice shrine without checklist excess. The melted snow globe charges the closing image, satisfying micro-setting rule. Spatial tracking is coherent across dive, shrine, and dream visitations. Two minor slips: “borrowed starlight” is reused three times without reweighting, and glacier ice as altar material is accepted on assertion rather than felt chill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus protective lies—emerges late, after salvage is already achieved, so early tension is diffuse. Escalation is informational rather than personal: each dream adds evidence but never threatens Elara’s safety, reputation, or conscience. No clock, resource drain, or antagonist narrows her options; pressure is purely ethical and described, not dramatized. The final exposure costs the descendants, not her, keeping protagonist price off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth as restorative salvage emerges organically from recovered objects and reclaimed honor; no thesis statement mars the ending. Subtext plays subtly in the captain’s choice to save passengers versus crew betrayal, letting readers weigh morality without sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: the snow globe is both sentimental trinket and portal, refusing single symbolism. Final image—“windows of connection now open to all who sought truth with pure hearts”—risks proverb but is earned by prior pattern of dream invitations.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a cool, submarine cadence—“darkness like borrowed starlight,” “voice like the sound of ice forming”—that differentiates narrator from characters. Filter verbs are few; perception is embodied in cold skin, flickering candle-shadow. Repetition of “borrowed starlight” is deliberate motif, not cadence artifact, and pays off in mirrored final line. Psychic distance stays close to Elara; no head-hopping despite multiple dream visitations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies between long, liquid descents and short pressure bursts—“They came … as fragments.” Synonym churn is absent; “salvage” and “wreck” recur with thematic purpose. Mixed metaphors are controlled: starlight/ice/water imagery coheres around luminescent cold. One loop: “windows of connection” is defined twice in adjacent clauses; trims 0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances goal, image, or atmosphere.</comment>

<comment>Ghost-whisperer wreck-diver is fresh synthesis; snow globe as dream amplifier is inventive yet intuitively right. Familiar trope of sunken betrayal is inverted—focus is restorative justice, not revenge. Specificity of glacier shrine carved into ice gives locale memorable punch. Risk taken in accumulative dream mosaic pays off; pattern taught early and closure legible. Derivative premise guardrail waived because salvage-of-truth angle reweights material.</comment>
