<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “quiet determination” is shown through bodily action (hands, eyes) rather than labels. The awakening bargain is dramatized—his wrapped hammer and the cold-burn surge—so the change feels earned. Minor slip: the final paragraph drifts toward thesis-statement (“true resilience wasn’t about avoiding brokenness…”) which softens the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: silk → trade → precision → arch supports → village seeking wisdom. The closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: azure glow on the arches = visible price + new status. No teleporting props; each beat tightens options. The “whisper of blue silk against steel” in the last line re-images the bargain, cementing cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and orchard scale are signaled early and return as the charged final image. The mine shaft micro-setting constrains every forge beat; dust motes catch magical flame, welding place to action. Sensory economy is high—no tourist catalogue, only blacksmith-noticed details. The arches’ glow reweights the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: prove broken things can be made stronger. Pressure escalates through each repair job; village elders’ arrival forces public test. Cost is visible—his essence traded, silence endured—and final image shows persistent constraint (travelers still feel his echo). No coincidence; every turn is because/therefore linked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: salvage as defiance, resilience through repair. No overt moralizing; final line lets the image speak. The azure glow motif accumulates meaning without being declared a symbol. One hairline slip: “learned that sometimes you must enter the darkness…” is a touch thesis-y, but it’s embedded in traveler's oral legend, so ambiguity survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is steady, with blacksmith-filtered diction: “hammering away at broken tools others discarded,” “calloused fingers.” Rhythm modulates—long cadences for orchard vistas, hammer-shot fragments during forging. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Orion’s. “Azure defiance” refrain taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; sentences vary in length without algorithmic pattern. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and precise—glow casts “mocking recognition,” dust “caught the light of magical flames.” Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic echo. One micro loop: “his hands moved with purpose, his eyes seeing possibility” repeats the prior beat’s sense; −0.2, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar “mystical object grants skill” trope is refreshed by the specificity of blacksmith craft and orchard planet physics. The silk-as-price mechanic is non-obvious: silence & essence traded for vision. Transformation test passed: swap setting or vocation and the emotional arc collapses. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of fight scene—pays off via charged final image.</comment>
