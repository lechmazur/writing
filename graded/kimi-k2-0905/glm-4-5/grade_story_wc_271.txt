<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—clutching the photo yet releasing it—play out on the page; the final renunciation is earned by the somatic ritual we’ve watched graft love and loss together. Interiority stays concrete (“clenched jaw = rising panic” learned via earth-touch). Only flaw: “diagnostic label-speak” sneaks in (“intrusive memories”) without immediate embodied cost, a hairline slip that keeps her just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the photo reweights both her survival mantra and the lighthouse-dark world. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—image folds, oyster shell, hands in soil pattern deepens until the final wind-toss dissolves the object with visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening: anniversary night forces the last fold/ release choice—options narrowed, stakes felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arboretum cliff, salty air, oyster shell micro-settings constrain tactics—she must garden, breathe earth, find shell. Visual/ tactile balance mirrors breath pacing; no static catalogue. Final image of wind over cliff reuses setting as active agent that literally carries the photo seaward, satisfying 9+ gate. Only micro-slip: “seaside cliff” repeated twice early, a tiny echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she keep the photo and still breathe?—tightens once on anniversary night: keep (panic) vs. release (stillness). Agency is renunciation; cost is the gust that removes the last relic. Coincidence limited to nature’s wind, which complicates rather than rescues. Under Accumulative lens, density of photo-touching beats escalates until the pattern breaks outward—sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the photo-to-oyster-to-wind chain: love and loss coexist, not cancel. No explicit thesis—final line lets stance speak. Pearl motif shifts from shell found to internal state to airborne image, reconfiguring meaning without moral. Resonance lingers because the object released is the same one we’ve folded six times; abstraction avoided.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices graft lines, children’s finger tension, salt burn on scars. Rhythm contracts with panic—“breathing shallow”—then lengthens into stillness, mirroring breath exercise. No head-hop; children’s voices reported externally. Only micro-drift: one instance of elevated diction “conceptualized” jars against gardener idiom, but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse body cue, plant lore, memory (“Her hands…gentleness that belied their history”). No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay consistent under oyster/pearl logic—no mixed vehicles. Final wind sentence propels outward without clutter. Clean copy; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Drone-strike survivor turned children’s calm coach is fresh angle; oyster shell → pearl of stillness offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk of sentimentality skirted by concrete gardening grit and salt-scarred hands. Concept not grafted onto empty metaphor—ritual taught to kids, then tested on herself. Slight proximity to pop-psych “somatic marker” phrase, but transformed through tactile earth contact.</comment>
