<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is shown only once (deciding to follow the lens); otherwise he is a passive observer. No contradictory interiority under pressure; the climax is handed to him by the lens’s magic. The shift from undertaker to keeper is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. Still, the vocational backstory gives him a specific worldview that colors every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—library lights, souls find sanctuary—so a Resonant Reconfiguration is achieved. Yet the lens’s rules appear only at the moment they solve the problem; no prior constraint shapes tactics. Causal chain is episodic: package → coordinates → submarine → magic lens-fit; pressure does not tighten, it merely advances. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty, but the midpoint turn is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Submarine descent and impossible architecture are rendered through Elias’s mortician eye—“weight of the ocean pressed in, a chased stillness that mimicked his own inner landscape.” Sensory hierarchy favors pressure and light, matching his professional fixation. The library’s zero-gravity books and spiral towers are sketched, not over-described, letting image carry wonder. Micro-setting (broken lens shards catching afternoon light) constrains the final act, charging the pedestal scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give rest a permanent address—is signaled early and reiterated. However, no middle beat narrows options or exacts a price; the ocean, locals’ warnings, and sub rental pose no actual obstacle. The lens assembly succeeds on first try, turning the climax into a wish-fulfillment tableau rather than a tested commitment. Escalation is therefore flat; the concept intensifies but the protagonist’s risk does not.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as sanctuary—emerges through the lens refracting lost souls into light, not through exposition. Subtext of an undertaker who finally houses the homeless dead is poignant, but the story spells it out: “giving rest a permanent address.” Final image of “impossible spaces between the waves” offers quiet resonance, yet the earlier explicit tag line blunts ambiguity. Still, particulars (salt-stained canvas, rainbow shards) keep the idea embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is graveyard-tinged—“souls he’d committed to earth,” “distress signals echoing through time.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under action, mirroring depth-pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and vocational. Occasional loftiness (“occupy impossible spaces that physics shouldn't allow”) is filtered through wonder, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid template cadence. Mixed metaphors are few, but “weight of the ocean pressed in, a chased stillness” fuses tactile and abstract without clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One hedge cluster (“appeared empty, yet filled with whispers”) slightly dulls immediacy, yet artifacts never touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Underwater library of the dead reframed as lighthouse-beacon sanctuary feels fresh; trope synthesis is specific to Elias’s vocation. Impossible geometry and zero-gravity books evoke wonder without borrowing famous set-pieces. The broken lens restoring souls is an inversion of the usual “lighthouse guides the living” motif. Risk is moderate—magic sub, no explained physics—but commitment to the fantastical frame sells the concept.</comment>
