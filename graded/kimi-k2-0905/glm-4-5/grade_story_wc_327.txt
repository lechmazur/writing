<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract; the “copper-veined” trait never alters a micro-choice or complicates action, so motive stays one-note. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final success feels preordained rather than paid for. The tears are the only embodied cost, arriving only at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the diamond sings, reweighting the premise with audible cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—decades of ritual pattern reach cadence shift rather than because/therefore chain—valid under lens rules. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The one soft spot: the “never-before-seen” bird pattern is pure coincidence that triggers rather than complicates, but it does not resolve the conflict, so penalty is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bone towers, copper veins, and echo tunnel are tactile, selective, and return in the final harmonic image, charging the closure. The canyon’s acoustic property literally enables the recording tactic, so setting constrains choice. Sensory economy is strong; no tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the diamond against the sternum) doubles as body and tool—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the tactile language—is clear early. Pressure tightens once: the unprecedented bird pattern forces an improvisatory translation that finally unlocks the diamond. However, the cost of that tightening is purely triumphal; no option is foreclosed, no new jeopardy introduced. Stakes remain abstract—loss already happened thirty years ago—so escalation feels ceremonial rather than perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—translation as resurrection—emerges through ritual accumulation rather than statement. The final hum reconfigures texture into sound, offering a non-literal answer to extinction. No moralizing paragraph intrudes. The shift from curse to misunderstood archive is effective but telegraphed, capping resonance just shy of exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the storyteller’s perceptual filter: copper light, fabric ridges, bird vectors. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “echo” and “texture” that accumulates incantatory rhythm. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register remains consistent—archaic without pastiche—earning high band.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“echoes filling the tunnel…echoes of the language”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final image is uncluttered, letting the hum land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Core combo—tactile extinction + bird semaphore + bone phonograph—feels fresh and specific. The “flawed diamond as archive” trope is familiar, but its coupling with a texture-based language and copper-veined translator transforms it. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure rather than plot twist. Hindsight inevitability is present—every echo promised the final chord—so originality sits in execution, not concept alone.</comment>
