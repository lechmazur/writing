<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory in scene: trembling fingers, tears, the micro-choice to breathe the scents he has feared. His refusal to fight grief any longer is earned through the ultraviolet reveal cascade and carries visible cost—he accepts lifelong haunting. Aromatic caution is more than label; it governs every beat until he breaks it. The only polish needed: slightly earlier anchoring of the sister’s name to sharpen first-image irony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward memory shifts from avoidance to deliberate embrace, cost felt in the tears he no longer suppresses. Causal chain holds: orchid timer → ultraviolet reveal → scent cascade → acceptance. Orientation is clean by 40 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps. The midnight/dawn hand-off tightens stakes without clutter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but memory engine: extinct ferns flank the vial at the end, literalizing “lost things still flourish.” Ultraviolet lantern and ghost orchid are micro-settings that force the reveal and re-charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s aromatic priorities—every visual note is scent-triggered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: vial, lantern beam, orchid, display case track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do some smells wound?”—tightens as each ultraviolet pulse evaporates another defensive layer, narrowing his options to surrender or madness. Escalation is textural/accumulative: scent layers accrue emotional debt until refusal becomes impossible. Visible price: each aroma costs fresh tears and time lost to shaking paralysis. No external coincidence; pressure is interior and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges scent-first: memory is not archived but alive, demanding tenancy in the body. No moralizing; the final image—vial between extinct ferns—re-weights the premise: absence can be cultivated. Subtext in gesture: the act of breathing deep is both surrender and survival. Complexity preserved: love remains inseparable from pain, no tidy stoicism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is wistful, tactile, scent-anchored; diction stays inside a lantern-broker’s ken—“cobalt glass,” “crystal-shaded beam.” Syntax lengthens under grief, contracts under revelation, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so naturalism test waived; interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Free indirect slips are clean: “he suspected this timing was significant” reads as embedded surmise, not narrator overreach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence. Density is high—“echoes in chlorophyll / echoes in aroma” compresses world-memory symmetry in four words. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent: no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Only hairline slip: “transformation completing now” gerund stack, but momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-molecule meets extinct-plant caretaker, ultraviolet lantern as séance tool. Ghost-orchid lunar timing feels mythic yet inevitable, not gimmick. Conceptual Repricing at end—acceptance of haunted love—could only emerge from this exact aromatic greenhouse. Risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
