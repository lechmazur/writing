<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s reckless-explorer trait is shown through action (kneeling to pocket the valve) and interior contradiction (skeptic vs. believer), but the swallowed-truth motive is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page cost is paid for his recklessness, so the arc feels observed, not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valve’s cooled weight reweights the ghost-shift myth into human tragedy, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is thin—radio call arrives by chance—but the pattern is taught early (radio as oracle) and the final image crystallizes meaning with felt cost: Marcus carries the valve, now “familiar as an old friend,” a visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Tunnel atmosphere is filtered through explorer POV—headlamp beam, damp breath, beaded brass—yet the valve wheel’s micro-setting supersedes geography: it constrains the climax when its warmth/pulse guides the vision. Spatial choreography clean; environment mirrored in internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find swallowed truth—tightens once via the radio confession; the valve’s warmth escalates tension under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (burden of knowing), not visceral; agency is reception, not action, so pressure peaks intellectually rather than dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: unspoken histories haunt objects and listeners. Final image of valve cooled at dawn reweights prior ghost-shift myth into human responsibility—no moralizing, just resonant reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers: whose confession? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean psychic distance; diction stays within Marcus’s lexicon (“practiced recklessness,” “religiously skeptical”). Perceptual signature—radio static as divination—creates distinct texture; no dialogue, so voice cohesion judged via interior monologue and sensory filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, rhythm varied; occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized final image”) drifts above POV lexicon but never obscures. No loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often does two jobs. Metaphors clean, no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: talk-radio psychic hotline + industrial ghost folklore + object divination. Risk taken with drowsy-alertness tone and radio-as-oracle method; coherence maintained. Transformation test passed—story fails if valve or radio removed.</comment>
