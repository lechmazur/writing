<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s skeptical-yet-forgiving psyche is shown through concrete ritual (bone-setting) and the iridescent tooth she still fondles; her simultaneous wonder and methodological care makes the final surrender to the impossible believable. Arthur’s “in-between” state is sketched with memorable economy. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page relationship crucible), and the interior shift, though earned, costs her nothing outward; the emotional price is implied rather than staged, capping intensity just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>A tight causal spine: discovery of substitute body → tooth keeps doubt alive → garden ritual → figure appears when bone-setting bridges realms; each beat advances knowledge and narrows possibilities until Eleanor’s worldview flips. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the “constellation” conceit is re-pricing, not abstract, because Arthur’s hand dissolves the maze walls. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by word 60, well under cap. Micro-turn—the tooth vibrating into light—carries visible cost at the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Hedge maze, upside-down moonpetals, captured firefly glow, and perpetual twilight are specific sensory anchors that actively shape the ritual’s possibility rules. The garden reconfigures at closure, mirroring the porous boundary that Eleanor now accepts. Spatial choreography stays clean; the iridescent tooth functions as charged micro-setting. No constraint directly dictates her tactics, so 8.8 gate remains just out of reach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore/replace Arthur—surfaces early and tightens through each failed rational filter until the ritual stakes her entire epistemology. Agency is internal: the decision to perform bone-setting on air is the decisive, narrowing beat that summons the liminal figure. Cost is conceptual (surrender of skepticism) more than visceral; because the price is off-stage to her body/relationships, it doesn’t reach the 8.8 pressure band. Escalation therefore reads cleanly but not ferociously.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-epistemic-tool emerges organically: Eleanor embraces uncertainty rather than solving it. “Turning mistakes into constellations” returns with shifted weight at closure, re-pricing failure as map rather than flaw. Subtext stays in gesture (iris-to-light tooth, dissolving maze) rather than exposition; no moralizing, just reconfiguration. Complexity stays intact: wonder is neither triumph nor tragedy, merely new stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style mirrors Eleanor’s precise-yet-aching mind: “defying all rational explanation” kept in character-bound idiom. Prose modulates cadence—long looping sentences for garden awe, clipped fragments at vibration climax—without losing clarity. Arthur’s single line carries double voicing (child + ancient) that distinguishes him instantly. No head-hop; POV distance holds until the final shared gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet transparent (“Victorian-era botanical engineering giving rise to plants that bloomed upside down or glowed with captured firefly light” packs world, time, wonder). Figurative layer stays purposeful—iris, light, constellation—each returned to charge closure; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemology,” “conceptual repricing”) fits narrator’s academic tilt but momentarily lifts above embodied lexis, preventing full 9-band entry. Beat-level propulsion is clean; no scaffold loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Changeling-as-doppelgänger is familiar, yet the fusion with bone-setting folk craft and astronomical cartography of errors feels fresh and specific to this narrator. Garden mechanics (upside-down bloom, firefly graft) supply tactile innovation rather than ornamental quirk. Final “constellation” re-weighting grows inevitably from Eleanor’s inherited skill and prior metaphor, passing the transformation test. Risk in quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle pays off under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
