<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while mining it for music—surface only in summary; the one embodied beat is the bowl-amplification experiment. The final “unbind silence” choice is prepared by the family storytelling but still drifts into abstract declaration rather than a dramatized fork with visible cost. Interiority is atmospheric, not wrestled with under real-time pressure; we are told his purpose is “to unbind” rather than shown a micro-choice that hurts. Earned stasis is gestured at, yet the cost feels conceptual, not lived on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly story cadence and object echoes build toward a pattern-break rather than causal dominoes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kael’s played melody crystallizes the stake of hearing beauty inside ruin—but the cost is more symbolic than actionable. Orientation anchors early; no teleporting props. The “rainforest burned” refrain risks loop but functions as taught pattern; still, the final image reprises rather than tightens, keeping the beat just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse/shipwreck mash-up is sketched with selective sensory strokes (sunlight through cracked glass, hollow hull whispers) that mirror Kael’s eavesdropping on loss. Spatial choreography stays clean; bowl placement and echo sources track. Environment does not directly block/enable a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8. Micro-setting—the clay bowl as resonator—functions as extension of place and charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ partial gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wresting music (meaning) from post-burn silence. Pressure escalates via nightly accretion of stories and Kael’s acoustic experiments; the tightening is a cadence shift, not an option-blocking fork. Cost is poetic—tears, parental affirmation—but no concrete resource is spent or forsaken. Agency is observational/performative rather than decisional; silence is “unbound” metaphorically, satisfying Accumulative lens yet lacking a palpable trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-ruin emerges through recurring images of cracked bowl, burned forest, listing wrecks—never sermonized until father’s single line. Subtext resides in acoustic artifacts: music drawn from devastation. Final melody reweights earlier fragments without moralizing, achieving quiet CR. Ambiguity lingers—will growth return?—but complexity is moderate; the refrain edges toward thematic echo yet stays within acceptable repetition for lyric frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Kael’s perceptual filter: verbs of vibration, metaphors of echo and glass. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for dusk hush, shorter bursts for bow strokes. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction stays consistent. Occasional loftiness (“acoustically perceptive nature”) momentarily drifts above Kael’s likely lexicon, preventing 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean: concrete nouns, active verbs, no filter stacks. Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. A few semi-abstract pairings (“chronic hush that settled deep in the bones of the land”) flirt with mixed metaphor but remain legible. Near-duplicate openings—“The rainforest had burned…” / “The rainforest burned…” —create mild template cadence; not severe enough to dull closure, so held above 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise—post-burn silence farmed for music via antique bowl-ship acoustics—is fresh, not template. Tropes of eco-catastrophe and artist survivor are transmuted through sonic lens. Specificity of echo-harbor vocation and greenhouse-wreck ecosystem gives idiosyncratic texture. Risk level moderate; no structural gimmicks. Transformation test passes: changing locale/instrument would erode core. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not breathtakingly unforeseen.</comment>
