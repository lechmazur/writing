<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—artistic control vs. longing for his sister—surface in the moment he touches the tapestry; the cost is the surrender of solitary authorship. Interiority stays concrete (“a jolt of recognition”) without label-speak. The final stance, shared authorship of a living dream, is earned by prior causality and forecloses the safety of detached creator. Slight safety-hedge: his flaws (obsessive isolation) are named more than enacted in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new thread-absorption thickens the gallery’s reality until it crystallizes into shared consciousness. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words and closure lands as Charged Poise: two siblings in a breathing dreamscape with undeniable conceptual cost—dreams now demand relational payment. Persistent constraint: once the tapestry awakens, solitary control is impossible. One hairline slip: “memories altered within his mind” is vague temporal hand-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gallery-as-body constrains every beat—walls breathe, illusions mirror gazers, thread responds to touch—charging the final image where the space becomes co-author. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (Elias notices pulse, shimmer, mist). Spatial choreography is clean; no prop teleporting. Micro-setting (sinew thread) functions as setting and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—recover sister—tightens when the tapestry erupts, forcing Elias to relinquish authorial control to reach her; price is legible: loss of sole authorship. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices. Could push higher if an earlier concrete loss (visitor injury?) had altered tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme—connection as co-created tapestry—emerges through image (bleeding colors, branching memories) rather than statement. Final image reweights premise: dreams require shared vulnerability. Subtext in gesture: reaching toward phantom sister = accepting interdependence. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-visual (shimmer, pulse, dissolve). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, fragments at climax (“a jolt of recognition”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. One near-slip: “realistically imaginary” edges toward diagnostic tag but is saved by immediate sensory proof.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences weave action, sensory detail, and metaphor (“colors…bleed…walls seemed to breathe”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor cluster—“ever-shifting landscape of possibility”—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fever-dream architect + sinew thread harvested from sleepers offers fresh occupational myth. Rational enchantment subverts dreamy cliché by insisting logic inside wonder. Synthesis feels inevitable: the gallery becomes a distributed brain. Risk—living illusion—heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
