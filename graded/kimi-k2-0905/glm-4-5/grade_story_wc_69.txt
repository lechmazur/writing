<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s “expectantly resigned” shell is vivid, but the text tells the trait more than it dramatizes contradictory impulses in scene; the choir remains an off-stage chorus rather than individuals who pressure her to choose or risk anything. Interiority is atmospheric yet generic (“expectantly resigned manner had developed”), lacking a single moment where resignation visibly costs her a live option. Micro-choice under pressure is missing; handing over the rosette is symbolic but not a fork that hurts. The emotional arc is therefore more illustrated than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative design is coherent: seasonal shards chart the choir’s slow unlearning, landing in an Earned Stasis where Eleanor retires but the harmony persists. The rosette’s final gift supplies a concrete, felt cost—her relinquishing control—so closure carries weight. Transitions between shards are legible (“autumn gave way to winter”), but causality is loose; the choir’s conversion happens between paragraphs, off-page. One tightening beat on-stage would have sharpened stakes and lifted the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velvet library, autumn-to-spring cycle, and the zither rosette as micro-setting are selective and atmospheric; the rosette’s grain is felt each time Eleanor fingers it, charging the final hand-off. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and seasons track. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—more tactile cues during rehearsals would deepen immersion—but the setting mirrors internal fade/renewal without overt symbolism. Accuracy is adequate; no world-rule contradictions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can fading arts braid hostile voices?—is clear early, but pressure stays diffuse; the choir’s breakthrough is reported, not dramatized in a single tightening scene. Eleanor’s agency is steady yet passive (she “persists,” “smiles,” “gifts”), never forced to gamble or forfeit a live alternative. Consequently the cost is present only at the symbolic rosette transfer; the emotional price feels communal rather than personal. A mid-story on-stage confrontation or potential choir collapse would have escalated stakes and linked cost to her skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony is not additive but subtractive, a lived counter-position to cultural loss. Subtext resides in silence and listening more than speech; the rosette’s shift from heirloom to inheritance charges the closing image. The final line avoids moralizing, letting the library’s “witnessed transformation” stand as resonant answer. A touch less explicit thesis in dialogue (“harmony doesn’t eliminate diversity; it elevates it”) would raise the score further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The free-indirect voice carries a hushed, choral cadence that matches “traveled stillness”; diction stays within Eleanor’s lexicon. Filter-verb density is low; perception is concrete. No head-hopping; POV remains stable across shards. Occasional template openings (“One evening…,” “Years later…”) soften rhythmic variety but do not break the quiet music of the prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; figurative language is sparing and purposeful. No mixed metaphors, scaffold loops, or paraphrase churn detected. Register is consistent; no academic drift. Final lines avoid overwrought resonance yet deliver a hush that reconfigures earlier motifs—an earned cadence rather than a drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The “subtracting noise” concept refreshes the familiar choir-redemption template, and the rosette’s micro-object focus keeps the angle intimate. However, the plot spine—bigoted singers slowly harmonize—remains genre-standard; the only surprise is the method, not the outcome. The seasonal mosaic structure is competently handled but not structurally daring. Specificity of Eleanor’s grandmother’s zither traditions could heighten freshness; as is, the premise feels gently refurbished rather than transformed.</comment>
