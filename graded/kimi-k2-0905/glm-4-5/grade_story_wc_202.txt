<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority stays lyric and atmospheric; we feel awe but not contradictory want/fear. The grandmother’s deathbed cue supplies motive, yet the present-tense choice—touch fragment to painting—arrives as declaration, not pressured micro-choice. No visible cost or irreversible path is foreclosed; the “eternal instant” feels luminous rather than risky. Voice is consistent, but character under pressure reads more witness than agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambiguous-drive lens resolves to Accumulative/Textural: layered lyric shards build density toward the final image. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—hidden histories flood in, re-weighting the premise; cost is felt as irreversible exposure. Orientation anchors (who/where) are poetically delayed yet taught by 70-word mark and payoff at closure, satisfying waiver. One scaffold: “elusively tangible” repeats 4× without pattern shift, dulling the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating market is sketched with swift, sense-driven strokes; swaying stalls, rope bridges, glowing potions crystallize a dreamscape that is also a workspace—the painting is here, the fragment warms. Selective detail skips encyclopedic tour and keeps POV filter tight. Micro-setting (lens fragment) doubles as tool and constraint, charging the final image. One slip: city rooftops mentioned once then vanish, leaving the market unmoored in space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor silenced histories—signals early; pressure tightens only in the final paragraph when histories flood in, a single meaningful deepening. Escalation is accumulative: each lyric pass adds density until the dot-pattern reveal re-weights the stake with conceptual cost. No reversal or traded option mid-piece; risk is deferred. The protagonist’s agency is receptive (see, touch, receive) rather than tactical, softening the cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring lighthouse/translation imagery rather than thesis statements; final image reframes childhood discovery as communal legacy, offering resonant non-literal answer. Subtext of archival erasure vs. luminous retrieval is carried by sensory counters—glow, dots, sea-sound—avoiding abstraction. Insight is earned: grandmother’s “method” remains cryptic until the painting proves it. No moralizing closer; ambiguity lingers about whose stories arrive next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a consistent maritime-alchemy register—shifting, glowing, salt-etched diction. Rhythm modulates: long, tide-pull sentences in memory shards tighten to staccato clauses at the touch moment. Perceptual signature is strong: narrator notices translucence, dot intervals, rope creaks—details a non-translator would miss. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on internal cadence; occasional template stem “as I…/I now…” is minor, not disruptive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is image-dense yet propulsive; sentences layer memory, object, and concept without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—lens as “anchor of intuition” remains physical and conceptual. One paraphrase loop: “elusively tangible” reprised four times in 700 words; trims 0.3. Opening and closing lines bookend with tidal echo, satisfying ear. No grammar slips; pronoun time-line clean across childhood-to-now compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses art-historian cryptogram with portal fantasy, giving fresh angle on “archive as magic.” Lighthouse-keepers-as-translators is lovely world-ink specific to maritime lore. Risk: lyric mosaic structure could feel prompt-stitched, yet pattern is taught early and closure re-weights it. Details—dot ciphers, swaying potion stalls—are idiosyncratic, resisting genre default. Transformation test fails only if fragment replaced, proving its necessity.</comment>
