<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “seeing but unable to create” paralysis is dramatized in tactile beats: her fingers on the brass dials, the instrument’s weight as embodiment of stalled agency. The internal contradiction—gifted perception vs. artistic impotence—stays active in scene, not summary. Her final micro-choices (tracing invisible lines, pocketing the notebook) convincingly enact the shift from drowning in input to filtering beauty; the cost is her bittersweet recognition of lost years. Single-POV interiority remains specific and sensorial; no diagnostic self-talk or stock epiphanies mar the peak turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes when she re-weights her curse into a tool, the notebook poised to convert star paths into art. Causal chain holds: because each traced trajectory reorders the whispered voices, therefore the creative block thaws; the astronomical instrument’s glow externalizes the earned change. The lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout—pattern build-up of star traces + whispers → cadence shift at the archway—so no causal turn is required. Cost is visible in the “shadowed rapture” and the ache in her hands, legible inside the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Aurora-lit archway + instrument + remembered stardust form a coherent micro-setting trio that actively constrains every beat: the sky supplies data, the tool supplies focus, the body supplies receptivity. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions across kneeling, dial-turning, arm-reaching moves. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s painterly bias: color > sound > touch; green-blue lights refract off bronze, never checklist sensory filler. Final image recycles the archway as threshold now recharged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she turn overload into art?”—is signaled early via the blocked studio references. Escalation is textural: each falling star tightens the pattern until the whisper-voices cohere into rhythm, narrowing possible responses to “trace or stay paralyzed.” No coincidences; pressure is purely internal-accumulative. The visible cost is the ache in her hands and the acknowledged years of lost output, both felt on-page. Meets 8.8 threshold but stops short of 9+ because the external world never pushes back; stakes remain psychical rather than also social or material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the conversion of raw sensation into art mirrors cosmic dust coalescing into stars. No thesis statements; insight is shown via the notebook being filled with star vectors. Subtext in “nighthawks whisper storms three oceans away” hints environmental empathy without sermon. Final image of the archway as guardian for future dreamers reweights earlier setting detail into conceptual cost: the process must be repeated; the risk of overload never vanishes. Bittersweet rapture avoids tidy uplift yet offers forward motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at tight psychic distance; diction stays painterly and synesthetic (“hungry for the stars it was built to measure”). Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“felt heavy,” “began to thrum”) and never generic. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for star-path catalogues, clipped fragments at threshold moment (“Her hands ached to work again”). No head-hop; astronomical lexicon remains plausible for a generational sky-watcher. Compression and ellipsis taught in first paragraph (“unwritten calendar”) are paid off when linear time resumes at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density lines carry double duty: “celestial hues…casting dancing shadows across her moonstruck face” anchors setting while externalizing interior branding. No mixed metaphors; star/dust/glow motifs stay internally consistent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“cosmic inheritance from ancestors…”) flirt with purple but are justified by the operatic sky. Parapraph cut test passes; removing any mid-section paragraph severs star-trace accumulation. Final third clean of loop artifacts; the closing sentence lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “blocked clairaudient artist healed by star-mapping” premise feels fresh because sensory overload is framed as solvable by celestial geometry—an unexpected synthesis. Grandmother instruction and bronze instrument root the magic in hereditary craft, dodging generic chosen-one trope. Transformation rule is legible in hindsight: tracing linear star paths converts chaotic audio input into ordered visual rhythm, a satisfying world logic. No derivative templates or pop-culture echoes detected. Risk in lyric density heightens awe without obscuring clarity, so the +0.2 risk bonus applies.</comment>
