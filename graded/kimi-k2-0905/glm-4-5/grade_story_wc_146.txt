<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas’s “infinitely patient” gait and the embodied ritual of fork-strike → footfall give him a consistent, occupation-specific rhythm, but interior contradiction is only implied, never dramatized in-scene; the absence of any micro-choice that costs him something keeps the arc shy of full credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sustained note reconfigures the town and Silas’s departure under Accumulative/Textural logic with felt cost (he leaves at dawn, task done, life unchanged). Orientation is clean by 50 words; causality holds; only the off-stage “collapse” threat keeps the cost from cutting deeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Silverwood’s skeletal architecture, the archway’s moss-whisper, and the cobblestones’ shifting resonance are filtered through Silas’s tuner-ear; the ebony fork itself acts as micro-setting that constrains every step. Sensory economy is high—sound and touch dominate—anchoring the revival without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore harmonic balance before collapse—is signaled early; escalation is the steady accretion of repaired objects answering the fork’s note. One meaningful tightening: the bell tower frame pleads and is answered. Cost is aesthetic rather than personal, capping tension below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of acoustic reciprocity—town and tuner breathing each other back into being—emerges through image, not statement. Final image of the road at dawn lets the reader re-weight silence as earned, not empty. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what Silas forfeits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s sensorium; diction is percussive, syntactic rhythm mimics footfall cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every notice is sound-first. Minor elevation in final paragraph (“cryptic expression”) is the only register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are sparse, acoustic, coherent. One mixed image—“bruised sky”—is minor. High information density; each sentence advances repair or resonance. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Bell tuner heals ghost town via footfall resonance” is fresh synthesis; the fork-as-scalpel and the archway spirit Persephone personalize the trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but execution commits fully. Could swap names without breaking arc, so not quite indispensable.</comment>
