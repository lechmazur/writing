<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory librarian/arsonist identity is embodied early (“her arsonist’s mind”) and drives every micro-choice; the moment she restores the portrait using fire knowledge crystallizes the flaw→redemption arc with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never generic (“volcanic tenderness” is a rare lapse). The final self-portrait reveal is earned: we watched her sketch replicas, handle tapestries, decide to stay underground—each action forecloses return to above-ground life. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A; single-POV interiority remains distinct and pressure-calibrated throughout.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: every artistic discovery is a because→therefore step toward the restored portrait and self-library. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the restored portrait is the literal “cost” of her past, reweighting her future as archivist. Cost is visible: she forfeits sunlight, accepts perpetual guilt, embeds her fragment in the door tapestry—“ashes” converted to hinge. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“Maya’s fingers trembled over the faded tapestry fragment”); no penalty.</comment>

<comment>The tapestry fragment is micro-setting that constrains choice: its threads guide her route, its completeness dictates the restoration task, and its final embedding marks the library’s threshold. Dusty archive halls are sketched with economy (“echoing footsteps”) but remain spatially coherent. Sensory detail is selective—touch of thread, smell of ash—filtered through guilt-sharpened attention. The fragment’s evolution from clue to threshold to symbolic bridge satisfies the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“protect the stories”—is signaled in childhood memory and tightens when each artwork recovered adds one more book to her future library. A single meaningful escalation: restoring the vandalized portrait forecloses anonymity and commits her to lifelong underground service. Cost is visible: daylight, social identity, chance of above-ground forgiveness all forfeited. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—“destruction as prerequisite for preservation”—emerges through the curator’s and Maya’s mirrored arcs rather than assertion. The restored self-portrait reweights the motif: defacement becomes self-repair, fire knowledge becomes restoration skill. Subtext lingers in the unanswered question of whether guilt ever truly ends; the library’s ongoing growth is the implicit answer. Final image of children listening avoids moralizing, lets theme resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature: textile vocabulary, fire imagery, cataloguing instinct. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for obsessive tracing, staccato when guilt spikes. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets N/A. “Volcanic tenderness” is the single phrase that edges toward lyric inflation, but pattern is taught early and repaid at closure, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances story or atmosphere; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry as memory, ash as seed). Opening and closing lines are image-anchors that bookend the arc. Minor template cadence in “For weeks…For years…” but spaced and purposeful, not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of arsonist-turned-archivist with memory-woven textiles is fresh; the curator’s self-portrait as future-self mirror is an earned inversion. Risk in off-grid underground library never slips into gothic cliché because grounded in textile science and penitential labor. Specificity of invisible-thread message and tapestry-embedding technique resists generic redemption arc. Residual familiarity of “ruin→renewal” is transcended by material detail and refusal of above-ground pardon.</comment>
