<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—scientific collector chasing the ineffable—drives every beat; the “sensibly eccentric” label is embodied in her calm breach of the lagoon, felt cost in the final smile at childhood rain. Interiority stays specific: compass heat, primordial dark, “hinged awakening” voiced only once, never explained. Final renunciation—bottling impossibility, not petrichor—pays off thirty-year obsession with visible conceptual cost. No second character on page; relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: lagoon water re-bottled re-weights her entire archive; factory closure as “signal” gives social cost. Causal lens holds: factory shutdown → cliff access → crevice → lagoon; compass agency spins then fixes the final stance. Micro-turn at “You’re late” tightens options without external rescue. Cost legible in last image—childhood vial re-inhaled, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Limestone crevice, obsidian lagoon, and phosphorescent algae are tactile constraints—she wades because the walls demand it. Compass-as-micro-setting constrains direction; its brass heat charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors scent/touch, POV-biased to earth-after-rain cognition. Early anchor clears by word 80; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crossing into explanation-failure—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: surface nostalgia → restricted tunnel → impossible lagoon; each step forecloses retreat. Visible price: abandoning scientific cataloguing for bottled “impossibility.” Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—transformation beats explanation—emerges through recurring water imagery shifted from petrichor to primordial lagoon. No thesis stated; final smile re-prices lifelong collection. Resonance carried by vial callback and compass inversion. Moral complexity intact: eccentricity validated yet changed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Elara’s scent-centric perceptual signature; diction stays within her lexicon (“petrichor,” “psychometry”). Rhythm accelerates underground: shorter sentences mirror breath-echo. Compass heat and algae glow render impossible without academic register. No head-hopping; voice stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths contract in tunnel darkness. No loops or scaffold; “hinged awakening” appears thrice but each reweights meaning. Metaphors (obsidian, bone-voice) coherent under earth/water schema. Info-dense: one line packs archive, auction, psychometry. Minor elevated diction justified by collector-intellectual POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor-as-quest for unexplainable synthesizes perfume obsession with cave transcendence; not a trope catalog. Compass re-function—from guide to state-change trigger—feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail (factory picnic ruins, limestone restricted zone) roots fantastical turn in lived geography. Risky structure pays off: three “awakenings” pattern taught early, recharged at closure.</comment>
