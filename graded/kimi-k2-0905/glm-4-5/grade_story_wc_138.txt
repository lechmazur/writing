<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alistair’s ennui is sketched vividly at the top (“each century stretching like taffy”), but once the amulet fragment ignites his intrigue, internal contradiction fades; the pivot from boredom to urgent mission is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choice. No real flaw complicates his restored purpose; the “cost” of accepting immortality is asserted in the final paragraph, not embodied in scene. Elara’s absence is a useful ghost, yet the beat where he discovers the fragment is hers summarizes rather than shows the emotional hit, keeping the change more intellectual than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: solar storm → magnetic disruption → fragment activates → dimensional glimpses → decision to cross. One transition (escondite → interdimensional corridor) is legible; closure lands a Conceptual Repricing that immortality is opportunity, not curse, with visible cost as the escondite collapses behind him. The lens is Causal throughout; because/therefore logic never breaks. Minor warp: the spatial-mutiny symptom is explained retrospectively rather than shown narrowing his options on stage, slightly muting the tightening promised by the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is recurrent, active micro-setting: light walls first distract, then become the actual portal that collapses after transit. Sensory economy favors shifting color and magnetic tension over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography holds; the fragment’s location “deepest corner” is tracked, and the storm’s intrusion is relayed through Alistair’s bodily awareness of fields “reaching tendrils.” The environment literally constrains the exit, charging the final image when he steps through and the sanctuary implodes—meets 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early: “break the monotony” + answer “what happened after goodbye?”; tightening occurs when magnetic resonance offers actual passage, trading safe ennui for uncertain multiversal guardianship. Cost is legible—he forfeits the only home he has maintained for millennia in the collapsing escondite. Spatial mutiny functions more as thematic echo than on-page obstacle complicating tactics, keeping escalation just shy of the felt-price premium required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—immortality as responsibility rather than curse—emerges through the amulet’s restoration call and the final image of stepping into eternal service. No blunt thesis statements; the insight is relayed narratively. Subtext in “hushed thunder” motif nicely counterpoints loud cosmic upheaval with quiet internal commitment. The closing line risks a hint of maxim (“what came after goodbye was not an end but a continuation”) but earns it through accumulated particulars of eons of boredom transmuted into mission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Alistair’s dimensional perception; no POV leakage. Diction—“taffy,” “escondite,” “charged poise of revelation”—feels ancient yet precise. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is rendered as physical sensation (“fragment hummed against his skin”). Rhythm modulates: languid rolling sentences for boredom, shorter assertive clauses post-discovery, supporting pressure without syntactic monotony. Meets 9+ micro-test for perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density. Occasional elevated register (“prismatic escondite,” “conceptual equation”) stays justified by immortal POV. One paraphrase loop: “not merely cursed but was a key” essentially restates prior clause; minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors, no filter stacks, no scaffold loops. Clean grammar, clear sequencing, and tactile specificity (“layers of dust in the escondite’s deepest corner”) keep momentum alive to the last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar immortality + lost-love + multiversal key are refreshed through amulet as missing stabilizer causing spatial mutiny—an inventive causal inversion. “Prismatic escondite” and “hushed thunder” coinages give sensory novelty. Conceptual repricing of eternal life from burden to vocation grows organically from prior beats, not tacked twist. Risky lyric compression is consistently taught early and paid off at closure, earning within-band risk bonus +0.2.</comment>
