<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo singer’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. custodial duty—fuels every beat; the shift from observing the child’s echo to actively soothing it is embodied in the seashell’s glow and her foreign smile. Flaw: the “reed-blown melancholy” is labeled repeatedly rather than shown through bodily wear or voice strain, muting the cost of centuries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the child’s light re-configures her purpose with undeniable cost (the seashell falls silent, her heart “lighter than it had been in centuries”). Causal chain holds: because she listens → discloses → sings → re-balances nexus. One micro-transition (kneeling to place shell) is legible; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight isn’t backdrop but navigational puzzle—star patterns literally shift paths—and the seashell functions as micro-setting that constrains her next disclosure. Canyon walls reverberate her song back at the child, making geography accomplice to closure. Specific, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintain echo/silence balance—tightens when the child’s rogue echo refuses to fade; her soothing song is the irreversible trade-off that costs her melancholy identity. Escalation is single but sufficient for lyric short form; price legible in shell’s silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—compassion > control—emerges through the shift from diagnostic curiosity to lullaby, never sermonized. The child’s light re-prices her prior centuries of detachment, closing on bittersweet acceptance. Ambiguity remains: will she miss the melancholy? That tension lingers, unsummarized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sensorium: “star patterns above shifted to reveal hidden paths only she could discern” is perceptual signature, not exposition. Reed-blown cadence threads every sentence; no filter-verb clutter. Micro-telegraph compression (“She knelt”) matches hush of action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to the staccato of unravelling threads, mirroring disclosure beats. Metaphors (webs, reed, echo) form a coherent family; no mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffold—only “the whispering seashell half” repeats for thematic reprise, justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing canyon acoustics, sentient seashell fragment, and after-life bureaucratic lyric is fresh; the child-ghost who strengthens instead of fading reverses standard elegy. Risk stays coherent because mythic rules are taught early and payoff is internal to singer’s transformation, not external twist.</comment>
