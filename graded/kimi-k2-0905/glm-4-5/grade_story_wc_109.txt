<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is textured—her fingers “tracing worn edges,” her mind “extending outward”—but her obsession is declared (“mildly obsessed,” “violently determined”) rather than shown through contradictions or micro-costs. No embodied emotion contradicts the label; the booklet and pebbles are handled reverently yet never jeopardize her calm. The final stance crystallizes, but the cost is conceptual, not personally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the oracle embraces endless night as canvas, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights darkness from curse to map. Causality is textural/accumulative—pattern of hush, pebbles, and booklet flakes coalesces rather than because/therefore chain. Orientation is swift (“highest tower,” “storm-tossed ridge fort” by line 2). Cost is legible in the booklet’s glow and the vanished star, though the oracle’s personal price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—“flaking gold leaf,” “marbled hush,” “pebbles warm as living flesh”—anchors the tower room as crucible. Environment constrains choice: storm outside isolates, darkness inside becomes medium. Micro-setting (booklet, pebbles) functions as tactile map tools. Weather and spatial choreography stay stable; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide others through endless night—emerges late but drives the final act of mapping. Escalation is accumulative: star fades, hush deepens, booklet glows; oracle’s agency shifts from observation to cartography. No reversal, but deepening tightens options from prevention to navigation. Cost is conceptual (worldview shift) rather than visceral; still legible under textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as map, darkness as medium—emerges through recurring pebble/booklet images rather than statement. Final line reframes “endless night” as “beginning,” a conceptual repricing that reweights prior motifs. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether anyone will follow the map. Subtext resides in tactile absence: unsaid futures held in stones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, oracle-like: syntax balances long cadences (“fingers tracing the worn edges…”) with fragmentary prophecy (“The end is not an ending”). Diction stays within mystical register without purple drift. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Rhythmic control heightens during final glow without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, almost every sentence layered (“gold leaf booklet trembled… gentle light emanating from her sketches”). Occasional metaphor stacking (“architecture of darkness,” “veins of different minerals”) but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: divination via cartography of silence, darkness as canvas rather than enemy. Pebbles-as-futures and flaking gold booklet feel particular, not stock fantasy props. Conceptual risk—no star relights, no heroic prevention—pays off in quiet reconfiguration. Could not swap setting or method without breaking the story’s spine.</comment>
