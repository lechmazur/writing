<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-deafness link is vivid; the embodied micro-choice to rewire firmware via amber shows contradiction in scene. Interiority avoids label-speak, but the beat of “tears streamed” is generic; still, the final tattooed-notes gesture earns a stasis with cost. Daughter’s voice as off-page catalyst is acceptable at this length, though it flirts with convenient echo. No status/secondary on-page, so single-POV crucible holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lullaby vibration reweights his silence and the meteor hush persists as stillness, cost felt in floorboard pulse and new tattoo. Causal chain (amber→firmware→fold→song→tattoo) is clean; no teleporting props. Time-fold rule is taught early via Arden letter; orientation anchored by word 60. One tightening beat suffices; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Laboratory blue glow, phonograph cabinet, and amber as micro-setting constrain the procedural choices; insect wing-shadow under circuit light mirrors his frozen cry. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual/tactile) filters through tattooist gaze. “Meteor hush” reappears to reconfigure final stillness, charging the image. Spatial choreography tracks amber hand-off and floor vibration cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the phantom baby cries—signaled in paragraph 3; escalation tightens when firmware is recalibrated to amplify amber rather than translate, foreclosing the old cycle. Agency sits with Elias’s signed command; coincidence only enables fold, does not resolve. Cost legible in permanent deafness plus new tattoo burden. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sound-as-absence emerges through amber-trapped moment and firmware mistranslation; no explicit thesis stated. Final constellation-of-notes tattoo offers conceptual repricing: silence reframed as scored memory. Subtext in insect “silent cry” parallels daughter without overt statement. Avoids sentimentality by keeping song off-page, felt as vibration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person cinematic stays close to Elias’s tactile perception; perceptual signature in star/ink vocabulary. Rhythm compresses under “meteor hush” then widens with lullaby line. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged via interior metaphor; “constellation tattooist” idiom sustains. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from short pressure beats to long lullaby release. Mixed metaphor risk in “time folds like origami” but taught early and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“haunted firmware whirred to life, screens displaying code like constellations” does double work). No artifact within final third; closing line anchors image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—tattooist + audio-ghost lab + amber time-bridge—feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Firmware that mistranslates baby cries into adult guilt is fresh twist on haunted tech trope. Risk in time-fold accepted and coherent. Transformation would collapse if Elias were any other artisan, proving specificity.</comment>
