<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “whimsically attentive” trait is shown rather than told—he notices locket, envelope, names, anniversaries—and this drives the inciting approach. Interiority stays concrete (“familiar stirring” when he meets obscurity). Yet the leap from charity funding to emotional locket-gift feels foregone; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates his generosity, so the final stance lacks cost. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and occupation informs choices without expository dump.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mis-delivered envelope → meeting → coffee → sponsorship → locket gift, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty locket space reweights the premise of “next connection,” cost felt as perpetual openness. No orientation debt; stars-and-sea anchoring arrives by word 60. Minor lag: “within months” compression skips the single beat where Elias’s shrewdness could have failed; still, ellipsis is motivated and does not break lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Retractable roof, starlight, sea breeze, and rare-document ink stains are filtered through POV priorities (shipping, human detail). Library is more postcard than tactical—only the envelope and later locket act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final locket image recharges the star-sea frame, meeting the 9+ gate weakly. Compact, selective detail throughout; no exposition stall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elias’s desire to “uplift silent contributors,” signaled early. Pressure escalates once: Eleanor’s halted digitization project presents a solvable problem that Elias’s cargo-network can shoulder. The tightening is meaningful—he risks social capital with owners—but the cost is reported (“within months … fully digitized”), not dramatized, so price is visible yet not viscerally felt. Fits causal lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—recognition of invisible labor—emerges through plot rather than assertion. Locket motif evolves from mentor memory to gift of gratitude, reconfiguring value of unnoticed work. Final empty-photo space offers resonant, non-literal answer: cycle continues. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing, though “greatest cargo transported wasn’t in containers” flirts with echo; saved by image-led ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature (shipping metaphors, client-name recall) is consistent. Prose rhythm is cadenced without monotony; sentence openings vary. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he felt a familiar stirring”). Register stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean, but four “whimsically attentive”–stem sentences in one paragraph create template cadence; mild loop. Mixed-metaphor risk (“composition of human connection”) but ships/music overlap is intentional. High information density; no scaffold bloat. Final-line parallelism is earned. Minor artifact keeps out of 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mistaken-envelope friendship is familiar, yet maritime-archive pairing and cargo-broker patron angle feel fresh. Locket empty-space twist repurposes sentimental prop into cycle emblem. Risk is moderate; structure stays linear. Specificity of shipping manifest heritage rescues premise from pure sweetness.</comment>
