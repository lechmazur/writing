<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—answering career-long linguistic puzzles via the rescue—remains abstract; we are told “ancient linguistic puzzles that had tormented her,” but neither the specific puzzle nor how the trapped scholar ties to it is dramatized. Interiority is atmospheric (“mind already calculating pathways”), not contradictory under pressure, and the final “silent promise” is a tidy after-image rather than a renunciation or crystallized cost. Micro-choices (negotiating, extracting) are present, yet the stakes stay external: the diary, not a personal blind spot, drives every beat, so the rescue feels professional, not crucible-tested. The interior contradiction required for 9-band is absent; the character works more as capable vessel than flawed agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “gaps in understanding were not merely empty spaces but opportunities both sacred and urgent” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost—every future gap demands rescue. Causal chain holds: diary → guardians → library → extraction; the “access points you deliberately omitted” line is the tightening beat that pivots permission. Orientation is clean by ~120 w; the bookstore-mountain is anchored in the opening paragraph. The lens is hybrid—causal quest plus accumulative texture—but the causal spine dominates and the final sentence re-prices the rule-set, satisfying 9-band closure test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but tactical space: “shelves twisted like climbing vines,” “books whispered their contents,” and the ink-guardians’ “garden of paper” all constrain movement and re-negotiation. Sensory economy favors sound and touch (“echoes of unheard symphony,” “traced her fingers over the worn leather”) aligned to linguist POV. Micro-setting of the diary itself—glowing green, pulsing with heartbeat—charges the final image and literally lights the path, meeting the 9-band gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across single continuous scene; no floating bodies or lost anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—enter library, extract trapped scholar—signals early and tightens once: the guardians’ permission renegotiation forecloses refusal option, visible in the hovering dissipation-script. Cost is present (risk of consciousness trapped in unlearned lessons) but felt only as abstract possibility; no concrete forfeiture (tool, stamina, social credit) is dramatized on-page. Agency is hers, but the external diary does the heavy lifting, muting personal price. Escalation is single-step: permission granted, mission proceeds; no further narrowing of options or visible price paid at extraction, holding this below 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: ignored knowledge becomes prison; rescue transforms scholar and cosmos. The closing reconfiguration—“gaps… opportunities both sacred and urgent”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in the unheard symphony motif, but its meaning stays implicit, heard only by those who listen, avoiding overt thesis. The concept is fresh, yet the trapped-scholar metaphor leans allegorical, slightly dampening complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s linguist perception: vocabulary of “lexicons,” “dialects,” “botanical notes” colors every image; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for wonder, clipped for negotiation (“Your terms no longer serve”). Compression during extraction—“speaking in dialects that could soothe angry text”—is taught early via diary fluency, so ellipsis reads earned. Distinct perceptual signature evident, but a few ornate phrases (“cosmic order of knowledge”) nudge toward elevated diction slightly above character scale, keeping this just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—“pressed flora from extinct epochs and notes in seventeen forgotten dialects that referenced gaps”—does triple duty: world, object, stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (ink-garden). A single mixed metaphor—“mountainous form breathing as if in response to the unheard symphony”—is minor. No artifacts in the closure beat; prop and spatial tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of bookstore-mountain + linguistic botany + rescue-from-ignored-lessons feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of living library is refreshed by extinct-plant codes and ink-guardians bound to language treaties. Risk taken: cosmic-scale bookstore without physical exposition, but pattern is taught early and closure remains legidible. Specificity—“echoes of unheard symphony,” “green light pulsed in rhythm with her own heartbeat”—anchors abstraction in sensory detail, preventing quirky ornamentation.</comment>
