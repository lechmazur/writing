<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete and particular—navigator’s “weathered lips” unfamiliar with smiling, scars as landmarks, eyes that “had seen too many wrecks.” Contradictory impulses co-exist: pride in guiding souls home vs. sorrow over past wrecks, shown in the same beat. Final micro-choice—pressing fingers to burning bronze while whispering “Welcome home”—is earned by six months of solitary vigil and costs a physical burn, visible on page. Voice remains distinct, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak; every trait is shown through handling of censer, charts, transmitter.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the navigator’s fingers on the searing censer while ship lights blink gratitude—options reconfigured, cost felt in flesh. Causal lens holds throughout: because hydraulics failed, navigator must nightly rebuild paths; because moon waxes, censer grows hot enough to brand skin, enabling final signal. No orientation debt—who/where/when anchored by word 60. One smooth scene, no teleporting props; censer discovered in wreckage, carried through every beat. Persistent constraint: bronze’s moon-phase heat literally shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<comment>Starlit signal station, patina bronze, and gibbous moon are not backdrop—they constrain every move: darkness forces manual charting, moon phase dictates censer potency, station’s radio gear must be reconfigured nightly. Micro-setting (bronze foot) functions as setting-proxy: its temperature controls when navigator can transmit and ultimately brands skin at climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—vision narrows to blinking ship lights, touch scorched, ancient bronze melody “only the navigator could hear.” No static catalog; each detail is filtered through occupational priority—signal pulse, silver thread coordinates, transmitter warmth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guide reverse migration or lose more ships—signaled in opener. One meaningful tightening: midnight call “Build the bridge between tides” forces immediate re-configuration of equipment while bronze sears skin; option to delay is foreclosed by moon at zenith. Cost is visceral: navigator accepts burn to hold anchor. No antagonist needed; pressure is coherent celestial/engineering clock. Slight softness: external consequence (ship arrives safely) is seen, but internal cost (burn) is stronger; still qualifies as visible price on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—navigation through personal and collective loss—emerges from nightly charting of “geography of loss” rather than statement. Subtext lives in gesture: scarred skin pressed to hot bronze = accepting past pain as instrument for others’ return. Final image reweights premise: “redemption” is not abstract but the blink of a ship’s light answering a burned hand. No moralizing; wisdom stays implicit in patina bronze glowing under gibbous moon, resonating without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, maritime-ritual diction: “silver thread,” “raw solace,” “reverse migration.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during call—mirrors interior tide. Perceptual signature vivid: ancient bronze hums a melody “only the navigator could hear,” a private synesthesia that never leaks into writerly explanation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens scalably from reflective to sensory under burn. Dialogue minimal but rhythmic, goal-driven: “Follow the silver thread” advances plot and carries subtext of trust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “patches of skin grafted from donors” packs biography in five words. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are consistent—navigation, thread, tide, bridge—forming coherent maritime loom. Rhythm varies: long cadence for starlit vastness, staccato for midnight call. Information dense: “raw solace” in one adjective-noun pair distills entire emotional state. Minor near-mixed metaphor “geography of loss” is allowed under lyrical license and pays off in closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial bronze censer as both talisman and malfunctioning hydraulic relic, moon-phase navigation tech fused with spiritual reverse migration. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious; no template plot matches this exact engine. Risk in quiet ending—no wreck, no antagonist—heightens resonance because cost is transferred to navigator’s seared palm, reconfiguring meaning rather than events. Specific detail anchors novelty: patina bronze foot humming an unheard melody under gibbous moon is indelible image unlikely to be duplicated.</comment>
