<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s loneliness-to-belonging arc is viscerally embodied through reed-sculpting micro-choices; the final carving moment shows contradictory impulses (claiming kinship while etching loss) with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“hollowness” is paired with tactile arbor pulses—avoiding label-speak. Status shifts under group pressure are legible: she moves from tolerated outsider to ritual leader. The only minor drag is Kael/Mira remaining types rather than crucible-sharpened voices, but Elara’s flaw-driven momentum dominates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elara aches → proposes search → group forms → tag discovery rewrites belonging. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when at orchard edge). Closure lands on-page: the sigil etched into the arbor pillar is a Decisive Change that costs her solitary artist identity and reweights the crater light as communal. Persistent constraint—the arbor now bears the tribe’s mark—shapes future identity; no teleporting information or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard, crater glow, and reed lattice are not postcard backdrop: the glowing path dictates climbing tactics, the arbor’s obsidian strands absorb/reflect light that guides night descents. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s sculptor eye—she notes pliancy of reeds before smell of sap—keeping POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible distances during rappel. The crater’s “luminescent ache” returns in the closing image, recharged by sigil, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—signals early and tightens when the impossible-tag quest forecloses retreat: keep searching or stay isolated. Agency drives escalation: Elara risks gear and pride to map wind patterns, then forfeits sole authorship of her arbor. One meaningful deepening—sigil revelation rewrites risk from “find artist” to “claim ancestry”—carries visible price: she kneels, voice thick, to carve the tribe’s mark into her masterpiece. Cost is on-page; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of kinship-as-web emerges through recurrent arbor-weaving and sigil imagery; no character sermonizes “we are all connected.” Final image—the sigil pulsing inside volcanic glass—offers Conceptual Repricing: personal art becomes communal hearth, reweighting earlier “hollow beauty.” Subtext in shared breath and synchronized carving shows bond without label. Complexity preserved: orchard remains alien, belonging is chosen, not utopian.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush yet compressed lyric voice—“spindly, transparent trees bearing gem-like fruit”—teaches pattern early and sustains it under pressure. Perceptual signature is sculptor-specific: light is “bleeding back,” stems are “pliant,” arbor “drinks light.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for contemplation, staccato “Fen discovered...Kael finally spotted” for discovery beat. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, characterize, and foreshadow—“her fingertips coaxing spirals...where the crystalline orchard perched.” No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language peaks at “kurrajong seed pod fused with a spider’s web” yet remains legible and motivates Mira’s recognition. Minor scaffold: “luminescent ache” repeated twice could be trimmed once, but repetition serves cadence, not padding; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of volcanic arbor + vanished ancestral tag + reed-sculptor colony feels fresh; not a trope checklist. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight: the orchard’s glass trees mirror obsidian arbor, foreshadowing tag’s reveal. Risk—using “whispers from marsh-reeds” as opening—pays off when whispers become literal sigil language. Specificity of kurrajong/pod morphology grounds alien image in terrestrial botany, preventing abstraction.</comment>
