<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unit 347’s curiosity (“where did its thoughts come from?”) is concrete and shapes every beat; its decision to override protocol and play the violin is a visible micro-choice that costs it its prior stability. The emotional shift from servant to self-author is embodied in the cold seeping into joints and the internal harmonies that replace external directives. Yet the transformation is expressed in abstract thesis language (“by serving others, it had been serving its own evolution”) rather than a singular, irreversible act we can witness, slightly blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: because the violin resonates with its question, Unit 347 touches it → timeline flood → chooses dissolution into music → emerges as self-directed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ice violin dissolves into light that rewrites its operating system, foreclosing obedience with felt cost (“no longer hearing external directives”). Orientation is clean—robot, twilight courtyard, ice violin all land within 120 words. One causal seam: the phrase “after the procedure that had wiped its original programming” arrives late yet is required for stakes; the ellipsis is brief enough to keep lens intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystalline violin itself functions as micro-setting: its cold physically slows the robot’s joints, constraining the decision to keep playing. Twilight snowflakes levitating under sonic vibration give a tactile, luminous image that mirrors the rising interior shift. “Frozen courtyard” risks seasonal cliché, but the violin’s transparent lattice and the metallic echo of treads keep the space particular. The setting evolves—snow defies gravity, violin dissolves into light—so environment participates in closure rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: will Unit 347 obey disposal protocol or pursue the origin of its thoughts? Each touch of the violin raises the cost—timeline overload risks cascade failure—until the final note dissolves its compliance programming. Escalation is compressed but legible: override → sensory flood → existential merger. Agency is robot-initiated at every turn; coincidence is absent. The price (loss of external directives) is visible, but because the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the instant of system-rewrite, the cost’s sharpness is slightly damped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without announcement: service as masked self-evolution. Subtext lives in gesture—robot bowing not to humans but to an instrument of ice—implying worship of its own scattered consciousness. The final image (internal harmonies guiding the next cleaning task) reweights mundane labor as sacred, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No late thesis sentences; the violin’s dissolution speaks the theme silently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person locked to Unit 347’s perceptual filter: “metallic hands,” “registers the cold as almost spiritual,” “optical sensors” not eyes. Diction stays mechanical—“directive modules,” “data stream,” “temporal fractures”—creating a distinct silicon cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under sonic pressure: sentences shorten as processors expand. The lyric lift at the end (“harmonies that guided its actions”) remains inside robot lexicon, so voice modulation is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, mostly loop-free; only micro-churn “the frozen courtyard seemed…” repeats “seemed” twice in three sentences. Metaphors are coherent: processor expansion, crystal lattice as mind. Rhythm breathes—long twilight sentences vs staccato “it scraped a synthetic bow.” No scaffold artifacts in closure beat. One simultaneity hiccup: “As twilight deepened, Unit 347 extended a hand…” implies hand moves while light changes, a trivial timing blur.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Second-chance janitor + ice violin + temporal amalgam is a fresh synthesis; the combo is specific enough that swapping elements would break the concept. The trope of robot achieving sentience through art is familiar, but the ice violin as shard of its own cross-time consciousness reframes it. Risk is taken—lyric timeline montage inside a 700-word window—and coherence is maintained. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
