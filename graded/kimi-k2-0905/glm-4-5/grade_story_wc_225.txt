<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The exiled tutor’s contradictory impulses—arrogance vs. penance—are dramatized in the micro-movements on the tapestry threads; his body remembers the prince’s death while his fingers rehearse restitution. Interiority is concrete (trembling fingers, unrecognizable reflection) rather than diagnostic. The final gesture of accepting the prince’s hand crystallizes a credible renunciation of self-loathing; the cost is the forty years lived in frozen silence, felt in the single bell toll.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense causal lattice: because the prince died during the lesson, the tutor is exiled; because he fidgets productively, he can decode; because he decodes, the bell rings; because the bell rings, time restarts and the prince offers pardon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time’s flow resumed—charged by the bell that names him, undeniable cost in decades stolen. Lens is Causal, taught early and held to final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen village is not backdrop but active constraint: every non-suspended object—tapestry threads, labyrinth walls—responds only during the four-minute thunder-lull, forcing tactical timing. Platinum labyrinth literally reflects his altered face, micro-setting as mirror and judge. Spatial choreography is clean: fingers move from tapestry to door to prince’s hand without drift; the bell’s sound propagates through previously soundless air, environmental state change logged on-page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the bell’s toll makes the cost of forty frozen years audible; the option to remain condemned is foreclosed by the prince’s offered hand. Agency is interior decoding that becomes external action; escalation is the shrinking thunder-lull countdown (4 min → 2 min) which compresses tactical options. Price is paid on-page: the bell’s sound is the audible debit of decades of silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: threads, labyrinth, bell—all are grids that demand humility before they yield. The final image reweights the chess tutor’s earlier arrogance: the “losing game” is now reconceived as the necessary moves toward mercy. No moralizing; resonance is in the bell’s clear note that transmutes guilt into mutual recognition. Specificity of chess-tutor worldview (seeing tapestry as encoded position) keeps theme anchored to occupation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays inside the tutor’s perceptual signature: “woven hush,” “productive fidgeting,” “fierce repose”—phrases that a chess mind would coin to name silence, motion, stillness. Rhythm modulates with countdown pressure: longer sentences during reflection, staccato clauses as thunder warns. No head-hopping; prince’s understanding is shown only through the offered hand, remaining externally focalized. Diction (“winnow,” “repose,” “platinum”) feels tutor-specific, not thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentence often layers temporal rule (“four-minute lull”), sensory cue (“distant thunder”), and emotional state (“desperate need”). No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances either decoding progress or temporal countdown. Metaphors stay coherent—labyrinth as liquid mirror, bell as audible cost—without mixed vehicles. Final sentence achieves Charged Poise: “fierce repose” crystallizes the oxymoron of active surrender without preachiness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fantasy trope of frozen-time village is inverted: the freeze is not spectacle but penitential classroom where the tutor learns humility. Platinum labyrinth functions as both literal maze and metaphor for self-analysis—fresh synthesis rather than stock symbol. Productive-fidget trait transforms from courtly mockery to redemption tool, a non-obvious repurposing. Risk in quiet, interior climax is rewarded because the bell’s toll reweights the entire temporal premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
