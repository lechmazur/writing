<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—she “traces the tendrils” and later “sketches impossible shapes”—yet her motives stay abstract: “discover the texture of time” is stated, never dramatized as a concrete refusal or loss. The merging-with-garden ending supplies a visible cost, but the beat is summarized, not enacted, so the change feels predetermined rather than chosen under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mosaic structure (present → retrocognitive drift → return) is legible, but causality is loose: the halo fragment triggers everything, yet its rules are never constrained, so later beats feel arbitrary. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara re-sees the garden as “time itself”—but the cost is asserted (“she felt as if she had lived a thousand lifetimes”) rather than dramatized, softening the final punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly tactile—bridges “pulse,” vines “breathe”—and hyperbolic geometry is repeatedly named, giving the setting a memorably alien physics. Spatial anchors hold across the surreal transitions, and the final image of Elara dissolving into the structure reconfigures the garden from backdrop to agent, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—understand time’s texture—but the only visible tightening is the threat of “dissolving” into memory; this danger is repeated rather than escalated through tougher trade-offs. Agency is largely observational—Elara “walks,” “witnesses,” “realizes”—so pressure accumulates texturally rather than through decisive forks; the merging finale feels inevitable, not a choice that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The theme—time as tactile, nonlinear tapestry—emerges through recurrent imagery of living bridges and fading photographs, culminating in the garden-as-time revelation. The insight is earned by sensory specifics rather than overt thesis, yet the ending’s assertion (“she now understood”) slightly over-articulates what the image already conveys, trimming resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hazily borders free-indirect, filtering alien botanic geometry through Elara’s designer eye: “impossible shapes that somehow felt correct.” Syntax stays clean, but occasional poetic lift (“quaking reverie”) fits the lyric register; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice could be sharper if her professional idiom (maze-designer jargon) leaked into diction under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, looping only minor phrases (“the halo fragment” x3); figurative language is selective and tied to pulse/breathing motifs. One mixed metaphor—“consciousness floated through disconnected scenes like fading photographs”—is forgivable. No scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks; momentum stays fluid through surreal beats, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of hyperbolic garden architecture with retrocognitive time-walking feels fresh; trope transforms via botanic engineering specificity. Risky structural compression (summary of thousand lifetimes) mostly pays off in the final Conceptual Repricing. The halo-as-key is familiar, but its merge-with-designer payoff reweights the premise rather than delivering a twist for twist’s sake.</comment>
