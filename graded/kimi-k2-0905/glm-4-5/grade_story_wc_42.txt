<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for the stars while servicing the instruments that both reveal and bar her access—is palpable in the tactile beat of rescuing the clock. Her mentor’s “whispers” rule seeds her later epiphany; the micro-choice to set the golden clock outside is embodied, not abstract. Yet the “sage” descriptor is never dramatized beyond generic competence, and her final insight is delivered in an explanatory paragraph that tells us the cost rather than staging a visible forfeiture. Interiority is textured, but the earned stasis lacks an on-page price we can feel. </comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: shaking foundations → clock anomaly → tuning filters. Orientation (who/where) lands by line 4; the moon viewport is a clear anchor. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—camera now records “luminous energy”—but the cost is asserted (“never be fully captured”) rather than dramatized with a concrete loss. No causality break, yet the absence of a felt forfeiture keeps it just below 8.0. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The observatory “above the clouds” is filtered through Elara’s tool-centric eye: dust from the ceiling, the moon framed by viewport glass. Micro-setting of the golden clock—its weight, its frantic ticking—constrains her choices and literally re-tunes the instruments. Spatial choreography is clean across the deck placement and filter twist. Environment is not spectacle; it supplies the resonance toolkit that saves the station. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the observatory from collapse—tightens when Elara gambles on resonance instead of force. The clock’s slowing is the visible pivot that proves her hypothesis; cost is conceptual (acceptance of perceptual limits) rather than visceral. Agency is pure attention and calibration; no blood, no broken lens, hence mid-7. Still, the shift from panic to harmony is legible and earned. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of transcendence-through-attunement emerges from the clock’s refusal to obey chronometric law, not from authorial lecture. Final image—cameras capturing “a breathtaking pattern of luminous energy that seemed to ache”—reweights the premise without moralizing. The ache is the price of knowledge forever screened by glass; ambiguity is purposeful. No epigraphic echo; resonance grows from concrete particulars. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, slightly elevated diction matches the lunar sublimity; no head-hopping. Compression (“The solution isn’t force, but resonance”) is clean, though a few filter verbs linger. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for nebulae paragraphs, clipped beats during tremors. Voice remains distinctly Elara’s perceptual signature—mechanical yet yearning. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong noun-verb pairings: “dust from the ceiling,” “leathered the boundaries.” No paraphrase loops; metaphor density peaks only in the final paragraph where it is warranted. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One near-mixed metaphor (“leathered the boundaries”) but clarity survives. Closure beat is uncluttered. </comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar station saved by tuning to a rogue chronometer—feels fresh, avoiding standard disaster tropes. The “escape velocity” is redefined as perceptual rather than propulsive, a conceptual flip that grows organically from character and setting. Specificity of camera adjustment culture keeps it from generic SF pastiche. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry. </comment>
