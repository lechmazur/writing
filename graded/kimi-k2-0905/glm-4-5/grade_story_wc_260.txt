<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“her own wounded spirit” parallels the chameleon’s tail—but the promised internal contradiction between self-respect and compassion is stated more than dramatized; no scene-level micro-choice visibly enacts the trade-off, so the arc leans reflective rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the decision to keep caring while “eyes wide open” crystallizes with felt cost, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is sound, yet the tightening beat is implicit (no on-page test of the new stance), so the cost is resonant but not irrevocable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Misty workshop and lantern-light scales create a micro-setting that quietly guides Elara’s attention; the chameleon branch functions as a charged object in the final beat, constraining her gaze and recharging the adaptation motif—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—how to trust again—tightens through pattern accumulation rather than external reversals; the chameleon’s skin-change mirrors a deepening rather than narrowing of options, so pressure grows texturally but lacks a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive trust emerges via shedding/chameleon recurrence; final image of “shimmering stillness” offers Charged Poise without moralizing, though the echo “reconstructing isn’t about forgetting” is a mild thematic echo that blunts subtext by half a grade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“microscopic scales catching the lantern light” is character-specific; rhythm modulates with mist-to-dawn cadence, no head-hopping, diction tightly held to her gentle register—clean 9− with hairline slip of “ancient DNA” idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density—“tail tip curled… quietly vivid display of nature’s artistry” does triple sensory work; no paraphrase loops, metaphors consistent, final sentence propels without scaffold—exceptional control, one stray adverb “gently” away from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-betrayal healing via non-anthropocentric lens (chameleon molting) feels fresh; however, the betrayal itself is off-stage template and the “misty workshop under stars” frame is familiar lyric stock, keeping innovation just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>
