<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but emotions are named ("sorrow of forgotten civilizations") rather than embodied; the decisive shift to archivist is declared, not dramatized with a micro-choice, so the cost feels abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: repeated "velvet garden" and shell motifs tighten mood until the blue pulse reweights isolation→independence. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final image of her walking away crystallizes the new burden—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Garden, shell, and crystals are textured through Elara’s skeptic-perceptual filter; the moss under her knees and the warming shell anchor micro-setting and constrain her geometric ritual, charging the final illuminated stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—access quarantined memories—tightens once when the blue pulse begins; however, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, and the price (burden of radiance) is asserted rather than shown altering her next move.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</comment><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-burden emerges through shell-whispers and crystal resonance; the final image of her carrying “weight and wisdom” offers understated conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly archaic diction ("tragically radiant," "charmed skeptic") stays stable and character-bound; rhythm swells with dawn’s approach, no head-hopping, perceptual signature is intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich figurative layering occasionally over-inks one moment: four velvet references in five sentences; "tragically radiant" and "luminous cheek" verge on purple. No loops or scaffold, but density slows propulsion at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fuses memory-archiving sci-fi with lyric twilight ritual; the seashell-as-data-device feels fresh, though "velvet garden" edges fairy-tale familiar. Risk is moderate, execution coherent, final image lingers.</comment>
