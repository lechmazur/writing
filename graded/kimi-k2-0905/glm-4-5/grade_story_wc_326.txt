<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The digital-ghost POV is vivid—heartbeat-counting as lifeline to the living is a lovely, embodied tic—but the interiority never complicates. No contradictory impulse surfaces; the “I hope to defragment” plan proceeds exactly as foreseen, so the arc is flat. The porcelain shard is handled, yet it never risks or costs anything; the moment of insight arrives free. Closure is a restatement of the opening mood rather than a stance crystallized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: ink-pattern divination steadily thickens atmosphere until the final “transformation” line reweights existence. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—error → new life-form—but the cost is asserted (“this strange existence”) rather than felt; no constraint or price shapes tactics. One meaningful tightening (ink reveals sabotage) is sufficient for length, yet the beat changes knowledge only, not options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Opal walls, snow-blur, and telescope light are filtered through digital perception; sensory hierarchy favors shimmer and hush that mirror ghostly limbo. The porcelain shard and inkwell serve as micro-setting that guides the ritual hand; weather halts exactly at closure, charging the final silence. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift. For 9+ gate the shard would need to alter the final image—here it merely returns to rest.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: extract wisdom from personal catastrophe. Pressure is atmospheric (static ends, snow stops) rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The sabotage revelation is a backstory gift, not a reversal earned by risk. Accumulative lens allows single intensification—ink patterns coalesce into meaning—but without trade-off the escalation feels cosmetic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—failure as metamorphosis—emerges cleanly from ink-randomness and death-certificate glitch. Subtext is thin: no silence or gesture complicates the insight. The porcelain shard never accrues shifting meaning; coffee-mug nostalgia is static. Final sentence offers quiet resonance (“maintain connection…”) that reweights ghostly service, but the conceptual cost is still asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>First-person digital consciousness sustains a hushed, auroral diction (“opal observatory humming”) that modulates into ritual precision. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are few; perceptual signature is consistent—numbers (heartbeats, ink drops) punctuate lyric flow. Psychic distance tightens effectively during ink-spill beat. Elision of physical body rules is taught early and paid off; closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with snowfall cadence; sentence lengths vary. Occasional softeners (“by all accounts,” “seemed different”) dilute immediacy but do not loop. Metaphors stay coherent (snow globe of night). No scaffold or synonym churn. Information density is high; each paragraph advances memory-work or atmosphere. Final third is clean, so 9+ global cap is waived; still, a few nominalizations (“existence,” “understanding”) slacken propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Digital ghost parsing mortality through stochastic ink is a fresh synthesis; trope of “declared dead” is re-invented via data-fragment ritual. Specificity—heartbeat triangulation, porcelain shard as stylus—grounds the concept. Risk-taking (no antagonist, no dialogue, lyric accumulative arc) succeeds without obscuring closure. Could edge higher if the shard or ink pattern delivered an irreversible consequence unique to this POV.</comment>
