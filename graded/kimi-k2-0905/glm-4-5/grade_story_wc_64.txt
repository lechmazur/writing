<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle obsession with cemetery echoes is vivid and embodied (“tender fingers,” “small, soft smile”), but the sacrificial reveal lands as an external twist rather than a contradiction that costs him anything. Interiority is rich yet static; no micro-choice is forced by the discovery, so the shift stays observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each artifact beat thickens the silo’s hush and tapestry density until the sacrificial reweighting. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the love→sacrifice reframing carries undeniable conceptual cost—yet the story only tells us Elias “processed” it; the absence of a visible gesture or forfeiture keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo absorbs starlight and sound, a micro-setting that literally swallows echo and choice; the sovereign case’s silver tarnish and tapestry fray are tactile, decision-driving details. Early anchor arrives by line 3; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single stake—decode the tapestry’s intention—tightens when the hum draws Elias to the bench. Stakes deepen from romantic to sacrificial, a palpable reweighting, yet Elias incurs no personal price; the cost is historical, not live, so escalation is perceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: love’s persistence across death versus the moral shock of sacrificial exchange. Final image of “hopeful dawn” reframes earlier cobalt gloom without moralizing, letting the reader own the aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical, hushed cadence mirrors Elias’s blithe absorption; diction stays within a gardener-poet lexicon (“velveteen gloom,” “water over stones”). No head-hop, no filter stacks; compression taught early (“cobalt silo under stars”) pays off in closure reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences do double duty (“painting them a deep cobalt blue that absorbed the starlight rather than reflected it”). Occasional soft filler (“as if the universe had shifted slightly”) and one metaphor pile (“uncharted echoes…hidden brook”) slightly dull the peak, but no loop touches the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing cemetery caretaker with spectral textile decryption is fresh; the sacrificial inversion of expected romance avoids cliché. Risk is quiet—no violent twist—yet the concept commits fully, making the echo-mechanic feel inevitable.</comment>
