<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s lucid-dream chronicler identity is vivid—his trembling fingertip on the scroll, envy of naïve past selves, and final micro-choice to roll the scroll and keep writing all embody a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction (yearning for ignorance while despising it) is present, but the embodied cost is more atmospheric than tactile; no concrete forfeiture is dramatized. Closure reaches Charged Poise, not Earned Stasis, so the motivational arc feels complete yet not physically costly. Slight over-reliance on abstract labels (“jaded wonder,” “feral nostalgia”) keeps this just below the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: birch-scroll, grave-vision, and aurora motifs layer until the final image reweights the premise—cartographer of consciousness accepts eternal loop. Orientation is taught early via temporal slip (“yesterday still felt like tomorrow”) and pays off in the mosaic of crossed-out dates; no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when scroll symbols glow, dissolving walls and forcing the soar; cost is conceptual—he surrenders linear identity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “every grave was also a cradle” re-prices mortality with felt awe. Slight drift into lyric summary at soar peak prevents 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and aurora are not backdrop but perceptual filters: upside-down snow physics constrains reality rules, scroll texture guides finger-choice, aurora recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s dream chronicler gaze—he smells pine and “something wilder,” hears prior selves whisper. Micro-setting (scroll) literally enables the soar; environment dissolves only after scroll glow, proving constraint-to-release arc. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the dissolve/return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias map mortality into narrative without shattering? Pressure accumulates via time slips, scroll glow, and aurora—each layer deepens same stake rather than pivoting plot. Protagonist agency is attention/renunciation: he chooses to keep writing after soar, foreclosing the path of surrender to chaos. Cost is conceptual—he accepts eternal loop—visible in final line “the chronicle would continue.” No tactile forfeiture keeps this just shy of 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular recurrence: grave/cradle inversion, scroll as map/non-map, aurora as storyteller—each image reweights mortality without thesis statement. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing: cradle/grave unity answers the implicit “how to live after seeing death?” Subtext operates in gesture (rolling scroll = accepting loop) not declaration. Avoids preachiness; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: time as “slippery, disjointed,” envy of “past selves who still believed in straightforward narratives.” Syntax lengthens under awe, fragments under dissolve: “He began to soar—” em-dash propels transition. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses during soar, then widens at dawn return. Register stays within Elias’s introspective lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with beats—short sentence at climax (“He began to soar—”), longer braided lines for accumulation. Figurative density is high but patterned: “snow sometimes fell upside down” teaches rule early, pays off at dissolve. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay inside dream logic. One paraphrase loop: “every grave was also a cradle” echoes earlier grave vision but adds reweighting, so loop is functional, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid-dream cartography + grave-vision + birch-scroll linguistics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky upside-down snow and time-slippage never break internal logic. Specific detail—scroll tied with “leather cord,” aurora in “impossible colors”—anchors universals. If transported to new names, the emotional arc would collapse; premise is inseparable from character.</comment>
