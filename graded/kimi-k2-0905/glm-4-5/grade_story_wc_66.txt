<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The copyist’s motivation—restoring silenced narratives via dust—is vivid and ideologically charged, yet her interiority stays largely declarative (“she believed stories should flow freely”) rather than dramatized through micro-choices under immediate threat. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; she glides from transcription to pirate broadcast without visible hesitation or cost, so the climax feels predetermined rather than earned. The final smile and walk home lack embodied toll, keeping the arc in thematic silhouette rather than lived crisis.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain is thin but legible: discovery of dust-as-medium → covert broadcasts → expanding listenership. Closure lands as Charged Poise—moonlit dust still “whispering” after she powers down—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is conceptual (perpetual danger). However, the stakes never tighten on-page; no censor nearly catches her, no tool fails, so the “meaningful deepening” is only implied escalation rather than a beat that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Ember alcove” and “mist-shrouded hillside” are instantly atmospheric, while the shortwave’s dial glow serves as micro-setting that both enables and endangers the broadcast. Sensory selection skews visual, but the consistent nocturnal palette (ink-stained fingers, moonlit dust) mirrors the covert mood. Spatial choreography stays clean—radio, alcove, apartment—anchoring the single scene. The environment never actively constrains her choices, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—freeing stories from state control—is announced early, yet pressure remains abstract: no raid, no listener betrayal, no power outage threatens the broadcast. Agency is iterative (she sings, she packs up) rather than decisive, so escalation is textural accumulation, not causal tightening. Cost is conceptual (perpetual secrecy) rather than viscerally paid in the shown night, keeping the beat below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: dust as mnemonic resistance, narratives as illicit water. The closing image of moonlit dust still whispering offers a non-literal answer—stories persist without her—avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the love-song code is clever, but the piece leans on thematic assertion (“she believed stories should flow freely”) rather than dramatized contradiction, so the resonance is strong but not haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice maintains a hushed, incantatory rhythm fitting the covert act; syntax favors long breathy sentences that mimic radio waves drifting through mist. Perceptual signature is consistent—the copyist notices ink, dust, dial glow, not brand names or city layout. No dialogue means no voice convergence; the single POV stays coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“thistled calm,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots the character’s plausible lexicon, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or concept. Metaphors (dust as water, narratives as food) stay coherent and purposeful. A few template cadences (“she would…,” “the dust would…”) create faint rhythmic loops, not severe enough to dull the closure image. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding冗余; the read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The dust-as-undetectable-network premise is fresh, synthesizing post-censorship resistance with low-tech magic. Pirate radio encoded in love songs feels non-obvious, and the conceptual payoff—that dust continues broadcasting without her—reweights earlier imagery. Risk-taking lies in the quiet, lyric escalation rather than thriller beats; the concept stays fully committed. The piece avoids tropes of rebel hackers or martyr endings, achieving a specific, memorable inflection.</comment>
