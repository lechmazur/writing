<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is rich—solitude vs. compassion enacted in the micro-choice of smoothing the invitation note rather than attending—yet the “staying while leaving” method is declared more than embodied, so the final cost feels lightly rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: invitation discovery → internal tightening → note refusal; the midnight clock compresses choice; closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the note handed over, path foreclosed) and the paradox re-weights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library’s nested architecture (hidden-in-plain-sight doorways, grandfather clock as time-tool) constrains every move; sensory economy favors smell of paper and hush that mirrors Eleanor’s internal quiet; spatial choreography tight as she moves “through the aisles” to final sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—solitude vs. belonging—tightens once at the clock-stroke; the invitation functions as external pressure; Eleanor’s agency is the refusal with cost (social credit spent, note as proxy); no coincidental rescue, tension carried by silence and time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing paradox emerges through concrete recurrence of “hidden in plain sight” objects (library, self) rather than explicit moral; final image of crumpled invitation bookmark reweights earlier material; no final-paragraph sermon, resonance lingers in quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person free-indirect hugs Eleanor’s diction—“nestled paradoxes,” “enlarged tranquility”—perceptual signature filters every detail through book-spine tactile bias; rhythm swells then softens with sentence-length variation under midnight pressure; no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“keenly empathetic nature allowed her to feel the disappointment of the sender” packs interpersonal reading into one clause; metaphors (library as “ordinary exterior… extraordinary knowledge”) stay coherent; final line cadence mirrors dawn hush without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “secret society library hidden in plain sight” trope is familiar, but the specificity of a midnight curator who resolves tension via a handwritten note refusal rather than attendance flips expectation; compassionate recluse archetype is deepened through book-tactile interiority, producing fresh inflection.</comment>
