<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but abstract; "cheerful gloom" etc. iterate without contradiction or embodied cost. No micro-choice tightens after seed-planting; realization arrives as declarative summary, not staked action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated "before memory fades" cadence deepens meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—paths disappear to become—but cost is intellectual, not felt; lens coherence intact yet emotionally weightless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Geode/cave is textured through prismatic light and seed-germination; micro-setting (crater glass) handled in motion. Place governs her transliterating gift, but spatial choreography is static—no shift in access or exit to pressure final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding vanished paths—stays abstract; no tightening beat forecloses an alternative. Coincidental bird-seed delivery supplies answer without testing her agency; escalation is lyrical accumulation, not rising cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis over loss emerges via returning seeds/glass images, but final articulation ("nothing was ever truly lost") is explicit thesis, blunting subtext. Resonance relies on reiterated abstraction rather than single concrete re-weighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains iridescent diction without monotony; "cheerful gloom," "sea-foam recollectionist" create memorable signature. Filter verbs minimal; psychic distance stable. Control slips into template cadence in last third ("Before memory fades…") dulling final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early; mixed vehicles rare. Rhythm breathes with paragraph shape. Scaffold: intrusive "before memory fades" refrain becomes loop; seed-scatter details repeat without new information, softening propulsion near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fantasy occupation "sea-foam recollectionist" and crater-glass memory mining feel fresh; migratory-bird courier of epiphany is charming inversion of messenger trope. Concept risks preciousness but commits fully; specificity of iridescent cave keeps it from generic allegory.</comment>
