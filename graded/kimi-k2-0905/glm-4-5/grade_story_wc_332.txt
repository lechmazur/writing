<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled ritualism is credibly obsessive; her micro-choices (3 a.m. shift, basement alchemy) embody the wound. Interiority stays concrete, but the sister’s transformation is accepted without on-page resistance, blunting cost. Motive coherence is high; change arc is more told than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sunrise layer tightens the emotional density until the map emerges. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—sister = light—whose cost is the renunciation of retrieval. Causality is metaphorical yet internally consistent; book arrival is the only grace-note coincidence. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archipelago is sketched through predawn breath and library murmurs; light itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory economy favors sound and luminosity over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—easternmost point → basement studio → northern island—with no impossible jumps. Environment charges the final image: light as communicative medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover sister/decipher longing—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by iterative sunrise capture; each frame narrows the search space. No external antagonist; tension is iterative-cognitive. The map reveal is the single tightening that forecloses literal rescue and reweights the stake into communion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transmutation-through-grief emerges organically from image sequences rather than assertion. Final image—Elara preparing next conversation in dawn light—offers resonant, non-moral answer to “how to live with absence.” Subtext of library whispers mirrors sister’s voice, integrating setting into theme. Avoids explicit thesis; complexity remains: communion is also eternal separation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during alchemical beats, contracts at shutter clicks, matching rhythm to task. Diction favors photic vocabulary—“luminous absence,” “cipher of longing”—without purple drift. Voice is distinctive, consistent, and unexplanatory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or emotion. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay within photic/bibliographic register; no mixed vehicles. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure beat—permitting 8+ score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Painting with light from sunrises to speak to the dead” is fresh synthesis of familiar grief-tech tropes. Transformation test fails partially: swap any dead beloved and core still functions. Specificity of watercolor palette + camera chemistry + library whispers supplies local novelty. Risk is moderate; payoff coherence keeps it below 8.5.</comment>
