<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete (traces leaf-veins with compass, trembles as she dismantles shields) and her oscillation between control/ surrender is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices—opening vents, walking away—carry visible cost and mark an earned shift. Flaw (mild): “reluctant metamorphosis” is named four separate times instead of shown through body alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: every storm → new anomalous growth → Elara’s tactic change → final vent-opening → explosive linden response. The linden leaf’s disappearance is the visible hinge; her vent-opening is the decisive act that lands on-page with cost (some crop destruction). Closure is clean, with before/after legible and a felt price. No telegraphing or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Moss-slick trellis constrains movement (she must brace a hand to climb, post softened) and returns charged in the last image as proof of concept. Rain and storm timeline stay coherent; soil, leaf-vein, greenhouse vent mechanics are specific and accurate. Sensory economy favors touch and scent over sightseeing. Environment becomes character partner, not backdrop; final shot would lose weight without this exact trellis texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: her scientific control vs. nature’s self-ordering. Pressure escalates because each protective intervention fails while wild growth surges, narrowing her options to one: relinquish control. Agency remains hers (vent-opening); luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is on-stage: some plants lost, pride forfeited, worldview inverted—visible in the doubled lindens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: control as limitation, surrender as yield. No overt thesis; meaning accrues via recurring storm/leaf/trellis images that flip value. Final line (“classroom…teacher”) is the closest to explicit, but still image-driven and earned. Minor drift: “reluctant metamorphosis” used narratively rather than through action once too often.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Close-third botanist voice: precise Latinate diction (“Tilia species”) braided with tactile immediacy (“moist soil between fingers”). Rhythm accelerates with short parataxis under storm beats, relaxes into longer sentences during observation. No head-hop; Marco’s dialogue carries distinct deferential cadence. Filter verbs minimal; perception filtered through professional bias cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with different parts of speech; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse, deployed only when it advances image (“wood surface softened and darkened”). High information density: single sentence often layers weather, plant reaction, and Elara’s counter-move. No synonym loops or scaffolding. Final line lands with satisfying sonic snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Core idea—scientist learns plants thrive without her—is familiar, but specificity of storm-season lindens and horticultural detail refreshes it. Micro-turn of vent-opening as climax is quiet yet non-obvious. Risk taken in eschewing antagonist or high-octane stakes; payoff is lyrical credibility. Could edge higher if leaf anomaly carried a sharper speculative edge.</comment>
