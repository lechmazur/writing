<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority stays at a summary level—“yearned to find the sacred,” “finally understood”—without embodied contradiction under pressure. His one visible micro-choice (unstrapping the pack) is clean, but the story tells us the keystone rewires him rather than letting us watch new behavioral specifics emerge. The ending claims a “change in him” yet offers no on-page stance shift we can taste; presence is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is diffuse: the spire “subtly transforms,” but Elias pays no personal price we can feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: banned archive → mist-walk → keystone → unstrap → luminous bloom. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: automated magic’s rule-set is reweighted by the keystone’s unsourceable glow, the cost being the irreproducible nature of wonder. Orientation is clean by line 3; transitions (archive → mid-air → folly) are signaled by ritual names. The lens wobbles mid-text—accumulative lyric passages sit beside causal steps—but lands in causal repricing, so penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ice-spire, cloud-deck, and folly are sketched with chilly economy; “crystalline window,” “clouds beneath his feet solidified into mist” give quick spatial grip. The keystone itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its glow literally prevents automated spellwork—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual chill) but matches the POV’s aesthetic hunger. One minor loose thread: we never learn how the folly stays aloft, but the story teaches early that impossibilities are accepted, so credibility holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can authentic wonder survive standardization?”—is clear from paragraph one. Escalation is present but single-stage: the unstrapping act flips the toggle; no subsequent tightening occurs. Cost is conceptual (wonder can’t be coded) rather than visceral; no live option is foreclosed for Elias personally. The reversal is clean, yet the pressure plate feels more ideological than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: standardized magic commodifies awe, while lingering luminance insists some light can’t be sourced. The keystone’s final bloom reweights earlier “brilliant dimness” from oxymoron to literal principle, offering resonant non-verbal answer. No overt thesis statement; the garden folly’s living patterns argue the case. Ambiguity is preserved—wonder remains fragile, not triumphant—so the score stays in high 7-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elias; perceptual signature—“prescribed patterns of color,” “brilliant dimness”—is consistent and coldly poetic. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within a mage-scholar lexicon. Rhythm luxuriates in a few adjective stacks, but the cadence mirrors the hovering, breath-held ascent, so the effect reads intentional rather than overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly taut; one paraphrase loop—“automation… automated… automated”—in the first paragraph dulls edge slightly. Mixed metaphor “ice glistened with a brilliant dimness” is deliberate oxymoron, not incoherence. No template cadence, no scaffold clauses. Final sentence is graceful and recharges “brilliant dimness,” earning its density. A few adjective pairs (“crystalline window,” “soft, persistent light”) verge on decorative but stay within lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of “lost keystone restores magic” is refreshed by welding it to a post-automation critique; the garden folly grown rather than built gives architectural novelty. Lingering luminance as unsourcable light is a concise conceptual invention. Elias’s arc from underachiever to quiet apostate avoids Chosen One cliché. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky, meriting high 7-band.</comment>
