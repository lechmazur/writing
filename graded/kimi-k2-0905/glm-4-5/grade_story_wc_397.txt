<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elena’s “grip reality loosely” trait is vividly dramatized in her tactile obsession with the parasol tip and her willingness to linger between ice and water. Interiority is concrete (fingers tracing lace, cheeks freezing with tears) and avoids stock therapy-speak. The change from seeking death to choosing to stay is legible, but the causal chain that converts the parasol from memento to bridge feels asserted rather than tested under pressure; hence the shift lands as gentle epiphany, not earned rupture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drift-ice images and lace parasol re-appearances thicken emotional density until the final image reframes “endings” into “beginnings.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s decision to stay crystallizes with the parasol’s warmth against her hip—felt, not declared. Causality is loose (Marcus’s gnomic advice functions as thematic echo rather than pivot), but the pattern holds. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is more than backdrop: jagged sheets that “cracked and moaned like living things” narrow Elena’s options—boats are trapped, volunteers work between floes, she stands at literal edge. Parasol tip serves as micro-setting in pocket, its ivory curve re-weighted from funeral relic to stay-anchor. Sensory hierarchy narrows under cold: sound of ice, sting of wind, heat of tea thermos. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible body or boat placements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Elena persist in death-seeking or accept transitional life? Pressure is situational—environmental beauty and volunteer routine slowly re-narrate her stance rather than force a decisive test. One meaningful tightening: sunset on melting ice + parasol warmth prompts the stay-choice. Cost is present but soft—no forfeited plan, only conceptual re-pricing; hence high-mid band, not 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ice-lace symmetry: rigidity vs. permeability, death vs. becoming. No explicit thesis; final line offers charged poise rather than moral. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide if “quiet endings” suffice. Subtext operates in silence between Elena and Marcus, wind as instructor. Lacks the final twist that would push resonance to 9-band, but remains coherent and non-didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elena’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature: “gripped reality loosely” licenses synesthetic ice-personification and parasol anthropomorphism. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences broken by fragmentary tactile beats (“tip in pocket”). Dialogue minimal, natural, idiomatically male-coordinator (“ice is breaking up earlier”). No filter-verb stacks; no register drift. Voice could be more idiosyncratic for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical without purple overload. Information-dense lines: “trawled not just the waters but her own memories, examining each one like a precious stone.” Occasional soft scaffolding: “she found herself drawn…” (mild filter). No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Final image “first stars appeared above the drift-ice marina” lands with crisp cadence. Minor hedge words (“seemed,” “felt”) pepper emotional peaks; tightening would reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourist + disaster-relief site = inverse birth. Drift-ice marina as liminal classroom feels specific; parasol tip repurposed from funeral prop to life tether is novel micro-object use. Conceptual risk—loose-causality lyricism—pays off in final image. Not 9+ because premise elements (tourist, volunteering) remain conceptually stated rather than dramatized in a high-stakes beat; still, angle is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early; frames stakes. One key turn: stay-decision contradicts death-seeking premise. Causal pressure light—no scene where she nearly books the fatal boat. Closure linked: “euthanasia tourist” label redefined as perpetual listener. Swappable phrase could trim concept without breaking image; hence mid-high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Handled in ≥4 beats: clutched, traced, felt warm, pocket-rest. Each reprise re-weights meaning: farewell talisman → lens for grace → anchor for staying. Irreplaceable object; no substitute prop supplies lace delicacy + funeral heirloom + hand-scale tactility. Cost visible: warmth against hip final image crystallizes choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><grade>Metaphor introduced late (“fold in patience”) and echoed thematically rather than dramatized. Does not constrain tactics—no moment where patience literally folds and blocks an action. Serves as tidy summary of Elena’s new stance; functions as after-the-fact label. Mid-band for concept-level presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><grade>Trait enables synesthetic perception (ice moans, parasol absorbs light) without psychotic break. Cost implicit: loose grip lets her stand on literal ice-edge without terror, risking slip. Never punished dramatically; thus not 8+. Still, perceptual filter is specific and consequential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><grade>“Trawl” appears twice—nets in water, memories in mind. Verb unifies metaphor but does not alter plot path; action is observational, not tactical. Swappable with “sift” or “traces.” Middle development weak; hence mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><grade>Disaster relief volunteering is the diegetic reason Elena is present and supplies Marcus interaction. Mechanics minimal—hot tea, pulling nets—never become crucible beat. Still, remove it and entire access to marina fails; setup gate met. Functional but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><grade>Drift-ice marina supplies environmental pressure: trapped boats, melting timeframe, windborne acoustics. Sunset on ice directly triggers renunciation of death plan. Spatial footing tracked; no floe-hop impossibilities. Setting is active agent, not postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><grade>“After waking up changed” signals indeterminate recent past; no ticking clock or deadline emerges. Time feels accumulative rather than urgent. Serves as frame rather than tightening device. Hence low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><grade>Motive stated early and repeatedly. Internal conflict visible: desire to hear “approaching endings” vs. discovery of new beginnings. Final stance redefines sound as quiet melt, satisfying thematic arc. Dramatized through listening to ice and wind; not merely declared. Lacks external cost, keeping it sub-8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><grade>Windborne solace确实是贯穿的调性——从开篇的“wind carried a sense of solace”到结尾“wind carried her resolve”。它随压力变化：起初是安慰的耳语，中段是冰裂的吼叫，最后变成希望的信使。虽然调性有递进，但“solace”一词被重复提及了三次，略显显性，未能像冰或阳伞那样在结尾以图像方式被重新定价，因此停在6.6。</comment>
