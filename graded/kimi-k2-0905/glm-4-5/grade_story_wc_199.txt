<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with order is vivid in her seed-sorting ritual, but the interiority stays ornamental—no contradictory impulse ever forces a visible trade-off. The “emerges transformed always” trait is asserted, not dramatized; we watch colors stain her skin rather than feel a cost that could foreclose an option. Because the final transformation is gentle inevitability rather than renunciation, the arc satisfies but does not sear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each seed and leaf adds density until the moonstone dust speck crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing monument reconfigures the arbor’s meaning while the warning scroll externalizes cost. Causality stays intact because the dust speck is earned by lifelong attentiveness, not luck. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who, where, when delayed until ~140 words) is taught early and pays off when the same ashen light returns in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment and tool interlace tightly: the mossy platform, bone prod, and moonstone monument constrain every micro-choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s profession—she reads embryos and petal veins, never tourist vistas. The arbor’s ashen light is reused as both atmosphere and closure mirror, meeting the 9+ gate. Only the brief “skyward realms” placeholder keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaf warning before the hush ends—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone appears. Agency remains observational: sorting, humming, assembling; no option is visibly foreclosed. The warning’s cost is projected onto unnamed “dwellers below,” diluting visceral price. Still, the pattern’s cumulative density satisfies the Accumulative/Textural escalation rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as cyclical stewardship: memory pressed into miniature seeds becomes the price of future survival. Subtext whispers through monument-as-divination rather than exposition. The final image of next year’s transformation already stirring refuses tidy moralizing. The mossy delight tone stays organic, never curdling into sentiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: chlorophyll-stained fingers, pollen motes in ashen light. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then shortens to staccato seed-names under concentration. No head-hopping; the lyric register is maintained without register drift. Only the repeated “ashen”/“mossy” pairs flirt with template cadence, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with Elara’s sorting tempo; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density is high—“moonstone cabochon dust speck” packs mineral taxonomy and folklore in five words. Figurative control avoids mixed metaphors; arbor as “slumbering beast” appears once and recedes. A lone filter-verb cluster (“seemed to contain”) is minor enough to keep 9+ within reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Folklore of seed-sorting oracles feels freshly localized to aerial arbor culture. The tiny monuments to extinct flora are a specific, non-transferable ritual; swap them and the memory economy collapses. Risk is quiet—no twist, yet the accumulation of vanishing species data gains ethical weight. The concept never retreats into generic eco-allegory because it stays rooted in Elara’s finger-calluses.</comment>
