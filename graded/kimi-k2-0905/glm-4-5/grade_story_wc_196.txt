<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interior contradiction—grief-seeking solitude yet compulsively documenting kindness—drives every beat; the button find crystallizes her need to matter. Her embodied reaction (“tactfully hopeful as always”) is repeated label-speak without new micro-choice, blunting peak emotion. Benjamin’s forty-year arc is summarized, not dramatized, so his “gentle hands” gesture never gets pressure-tested on the page. Closure works as mutual Earned Stasis: both accept institutional solitude with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minor therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-pattern method taught early, cadence of kindness anecdotes builds density, final image reweights institutional dust as shared legacy. Closure lands as Charged Poise—two ex-foster children holding matching buttons in silence—conceptual cost of perpetual institutional belonging is undeniable. One causality micro-gap: button is “missing from the right lapel” in photo yet no previous mention of its absence, a teleport-notice, but it does not break the RR. Orientation clean within 120 words; transitions inside single file-room scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Foster-care file room as micro-setting constrains choices—Eleanor must read dust, not people; Benjamin returns because only here his paper self exists. Brass button operates as portable setting/object hybrid: states change from lost→found→paired, charging final image. Sensory selection favors visual dust & tactile paper, appropriate to archivist’s profession; smell of old carbon ink could have tightened further. Spatial choreography clean—drawer seven, lamp adjust, folder removal track across body without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Dominant stake: can institutional detritus verify that kindness left a mark? Pressure escalates texturally—each discovered kindness anecdote adds weight until Eleanor must test her hypothesis in real time with Benjamin. His arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves; final silence forces stance crystallization for both. Cost legible: Eleanor forfeits anonymity, Benjamin admits he “came back to feel connected,” both embrace file-room dust as home—small but undeniable price under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: undocumented compassion is the true archive. Subtext operates through object silence—button needs no speech; paired buttons reprice the bureaucratic system as secret keeper of love. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance rests in tacit handshake of two institutional orphans. Ambiguity preserved: kindness is magnified yet still physically relegated to forgotten drawers—complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays outside Eleanor until final Charged Poise, a deliberate distance that mirrors archival remove; perceptual signature—“dust signature,” “yellowed papers”—is consistent and profession-specific. Prose rhythm lengthens during catalog of kindnesses, then contracts to single-line dialogue at entrance, mirroring emotional aperture. No head-hopping; Benjamin’s interior accessed only after he becomes present. Diction precise: “emancipated,” “infantryman,” “tarnished brass” carry institutional weight without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>High information density: one sentence often layers dust science + emotional stake + world rule. No loops or paraphrase; however, “tactfully hopeful” appears thrice without fresh inflection, drifting toward template. Mixed metaphor risk—“shattered heart” vs “dust signature”—but physical logic intact. Closing line “room of unexamined unknowns” is compressed, rhythmic, propulsive—earns its slightly elevated register as thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foster-care dust forensics feels fresh; button-as-legacy reverses typical war-token trope by linking absent grandfather to bureaucratic childhood. Synthesis of archival science with emotional archaeology is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: climax is silent hand-off, not revelation; coherence maintained. Could swap Eleanor for another grieving clerk, but dust-method specificity and kindness catalog anchor the concept to this voice.</comment>
