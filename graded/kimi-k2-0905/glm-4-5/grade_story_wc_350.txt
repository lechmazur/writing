<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation is legible and consistent, but interiority stays at summary level (“she knew,” “she understood”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No moment shows her simultaneously wanting harmony and fearing failure; choices are declared, not embodied. The final beat of attaching the new chain is symbolic rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: discovery of weight → talks reboot → bridge project. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the restored weight/timepiece reweights community time—but the cost is communal, not personal to Elena, so the lens stays Hybrid. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (basement→library) and it’s sign-posted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clock-tower interior is tactile: dusty box, polished brass, resonant bell. The tower’s vertical space and shared acoustics are used to stage the multilingual meetings, so setting constrains logistics. Micro-setting (the weight in Elena’s palm) reappears at closure, charging the final image. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual and auditory—but selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal farmer/town rift—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each meeting adds attendees and cooperative projects, but no single beat tightens options or exacts a visible price from Elena. The bridge reconstruction is reported victory, not a moment that forecloses her alternative paths. Cost is felt socially, not personally, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of synchronized time-as-community emerges through the restored mechanism rather than exposition. Final image of the weight on its new chain reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext in multilingual exchanges carries the real negotiation, letting theme breathe. One soft echo: “bridges from silos” is close to articulating the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly latched to Elena; no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent with a librarian’s idiom (“empathetically decisive grace”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for choral calm, shorter for meeting tension. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven when present; voices not fully distinct, yet scarcity keeps focus on Elena’s filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“she knew,” “she understood”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density is high: one sentence often advances scene and symbolism together. Occasional soft fillers—“with each passing sunset”—but none occur in the closure beat, so momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing astronomical clock mechanics with community reconciliation is fresh, yet the multilingual-library trope is familiar. Specific detail—silo paint chips as garden minerals—adds local texture. Risk level is moderate; the piece avoids sentimentality but also avoids personal cost, staying safe. Transformation feels communal rather than individually revelatory.</comment>
