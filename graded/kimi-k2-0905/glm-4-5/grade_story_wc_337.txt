<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s accumulated-silence attribute is dramatized in body (trembling hands) and micro-choice (needle work that literally inhales whispers). Her own fracture is kept active—she never “heals,” only trades one shard of damage for a sliver of usefulness, satisfying Earned Stasis. Jacob’s pressure is thin but sufficient to trigger her stance crystallization. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; only the tiniest drift toward therapeutic self-summary at “A secret isn’t meant…” keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final stillness reconfigures both Jacob’s burden and Elena’s brokenness without tidy repair. Causal chain holds—every knot pulled releases a whisper that feeds Elena’s silence-storage, making the hush literally denser. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (prism sanctuary, starlight, two named bodies). No teleporting props; the net’s rope age is learned through action, not dump. Cost is undeniable: Elena’s “own damage repaired” is explicitly partial, a single tile in a shattered mosaic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting: crystalline walls refract light that guides Elena’s needle angle and supplies the “multicolored shards” that mirror her psyche. Starlight above becomes a narrative clock—spirits settle “like snowflakes finding earth,” recharging the opening image. The net’s fiber age and salt-stiffness constrain how each knot can be unraveled, determining pace. Sensory economy is tight; no visual overdose, tactile priority fits restorer POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ground the spirits or the night remains restless—is signaled in paragraph three. Pressure tightens once: each loosened knot narrows Elena’s physical options (thread tension, spirit hiss) and enlarges the silence mass she must contain. Cost is visible: tremor worsens, “one tiny section” of self-repair is the finite payoff. No coincidence; escalation is purely agency-driven under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of mask-work: mending others’ faces reveals the unmendable self. The interlaced hush motif accumulates literal weight, re-pricing silence from refuge to tool. Subtext in Jacob’s cracked whisper carries 70 years of unvoiced grief without once naming it. Final line’s “patterns on the floor that looked like mended masks” offers resonant non-literal answer—mending is projection, never completion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic, matching the ceremonial task. Syntax lengthens and shortens with knot rhythm—“thread older than memory” vs. “net fell away like water.” No head-hopping; Jacob’s interior accessed only via Elena’s perception of his face-rings. Dialogue minimal, indirection perfect: “The net… it’s tied to their suffering” says everything without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—“silver glint catching the multicolored light that fractured” does three jobs in nine words. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors. Only a single filter-verb stack (“seemed to pulse”) keeps it from 9+; still within tolerance. Closing sentence lands clean, recharges “mended masks” motif without forced echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses three otherwise tired tropes—broken healer, ghost-knots, magical silence—into a single organic instrument. The silence-accumulation mechanic is non-obvious and drives every beat; removal collapses plot. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off: no conventional confrontation, yet tension climbs through sensory density. Final image feels inevitable only after it appears—true hindsight inevitability.</comment>
