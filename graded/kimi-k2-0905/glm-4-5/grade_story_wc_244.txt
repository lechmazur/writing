<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archie’s loneliness and compulsive joviality are vividly embodied; the moon-rock keepsake gives his isolation a concrete tether. Yet the transition from “distribute aid” to “fabricate lunar cult” feels like a motivations leap rather than a pressured evolution—no visible micro-choice shows him deciding deception is worth risking his ethical code. The final beat accepts cost (“they’d never know his name”) but the interior contradiction that might have sharpened that renunciation is stated, not dramatized. Still, his voice, gesture palette, and the flaw/competence balance stay individual and consistent.</comment>

<comment>The mosaic of rumor shards is taught early and each segue is time-stamped, satisfying Track B. Closure lands cleanly: the loneliness “cure” reframed as the sharing itself is a Conceptual Repricing with social cost felt in the final anonymity beat. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each channel adding social density rather than tight because/therefore chains. The only minor waiver is that the initiating decision to seed the rumor happens off-page in the gap between paragraphs; once accepted, the pattern delivers.</comment>

<comment>The ivied station works as micro-setting: it offers concealment for clandestine meets and its derelict grandeur mirrors Archie’s own obsolete cheerfulness. Sensory cues are selective (cracked mirror, dawn through broken panes) and keyed to mood rather than catalogued. Spatial logic is tracked cleanly through the taxi/café chain; no floating geography. Environment does not directly constrain the final image, so it stops just short of 9-band gating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can Archie trade fakery for genuine connection—tightens when media uptake makes retreat impossible. Escalation is Accumulative: each new channel thickens social exposure and potential exposure of the pumice truth. Archie pays no immediate physical price, but the “polite anarchy” beat shows his loss of authorial control, a visible soft cost. A sharper tangible forfeiture near the end would have pushed it higher, but the deepening of reach keeps pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: counterfeit miracle becomes real communion—loneliness cured by collective belief, not by the object. The final line’s anonymity reframes reciprocity itself as the gift Archie can never claim payment for, a satisfying conceptual twist. Subtext operates in the rumor’s spread rather than labeled insight. The absence of an explicit moral lets the irony breathe, though one more echo of prior imagery in that closing beat could have deepened resonance into 9-territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice owns a consistent, lightly sardonic cadence that mirrors Archie’s stage-managing personality; sentences modulate length to mirror his manic patter versus private fatigue. Free indirect dips stay clean (“the universe seemed to owe him several”). Perceptual signature is sharp—he notices logistics networks, not décor, yet ivy and cracked mirror slip through the professional filter, betraying sentiment. No head-hopping or register drift; lyric compression in the rumor montage is taught by the rhythmic “Three days later…” refrain and paid off. Closure beat keeps that same rhythmic control, justifying near-max score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence either advances the rumor lattice or colors Archie’s mask. Metaphors are sparse but precise (“platforms disappearing beneath waves of ivy”). No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; transitions are elliptical yet clear. Final clause “grateful to him though they’d never know his name” lands with snap, no scaffolding. Minor overwrite only in the list of rumor conduits which could have been pruned by one example, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Using disaster logistics expertise to spawn a viral placebo cult is an off-angle synthesis not seen in stock plots. The take-that-reciprocity-as-anonymous-gift reweights the childhood premise in a way that feels inevitable only after the final line. Risk is present—montage instead of scene, fake miracle premise—yet coherence never frays. Could push into 9+ if the moon-rock fetish had carried a sharper physical twist at the end rather than remaining symbolic.</comment>
