<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet’s gentle, self-sacrificing nature is consistent, but he never faces a real dilemma or pays a visible price; the “wistful” mask never slips into contradiction, so the arc is flat. Interiority is atmospheric rather than conflicted, and the final act costs him nothing we can feel. No micro-choice under pressure sharpens his values hierarchy. Earned Stasis is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the room sings, generations touch, and the poet’s life gains purpose—cost is implied but not felt on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of captured sounds → music box → communal release tightens meaning without causal reversals. One shard, no orientation debt. Missing a tangible constraint or price that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory selection is biased to the poet’s scavenger eye—salt-stained carvings, dust motes as “tiny performers”—and the loft’s sand-filtered light constrains his privacy. The senior-center table becomes the charged micro-setting where the final image crystallizes. Details are woven through action, never catalogued. Enough specificity to reach high band, but the environment never actively blocks or endangers him, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—bridge generations—but the only pressure is the poet’s internal anticipation; no external obstacle or risk materializes. Escalation is a smooth ramp from discovery to presentation without reversal or trade-off. The communal singing is lovely but arrives as pure reward; nothing is foreclosed or sacrificed. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification is present yet cost-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of sound-as-blood emerges organically from the glass jars and the shared melody; no character sermonizes. Final image reweights the jars from hoarded loneliness to communal gift. Ambiguity remains—will the silence return?—so the piece avoids moralizing. The concept is gentle and coherent, but the lack of a price paid keeps resonance pleasant rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the poet’s perceptual filter: “calloused from crafting verses,” “theater of his solitary existence.” Syntax lengthens and softens under wistfulness, then tightens at the music-box click. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom is consistent and salted with scavenger metaphors. Register never drifts into editorial explanation; the music-box description is the single purple patch, not enough to breach clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical—varied cadence, strong verbs, little scaffolding—but figurative density spikes in the music-box paragraph (“love stories that had ended too soon”) without new causal information, costing momentum. Elsewhere, sentences carry double duty: “Sunlight filtered…illuminating dust motes dancing” advances both setting and emotional state. No loops or synonym churn. A trim of the ornate stanza would push this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound-collecting hobo—risks whimsy, but grounding the jars in scavenger economy and salt-rot detail keeps it fresh. The music box is familiar, yet its function as social catalyst rather than personal nostalgia reframes it. Risk is moderate: no grimdark twist, but the choice to keep the poet poor and peripheral feels honest. Synthesis is specific enough to survive a name-and-place swap test, though barely.</comment>
