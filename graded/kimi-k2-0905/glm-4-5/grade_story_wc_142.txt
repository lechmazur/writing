<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—preserve elders’ carnival or bow to gentrifiers—remains vivid and embodied; the foundation-stone chip pressed in pocket, paint under nails, “signs and symbols” muttered while tracing murals. Motivation escalates: from passive pattern-seeing to active cipher-making, culminating in the risky anonymous counter-proposal. The final relinquishment of the chip back to the communal monument shows earned cost, not tidy triumph. Voice stays particular; no therapeutic self-labelling, only salt-stung, paint-stained choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single causal spine holds: graffiti mural as cipher → Maya’s three-night remapping → flash-mob defiance → coded counter-proposal → partial victory. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“floating raft city of Neptunia… perpetual carnival”) well inside 120-word allowance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “spiral inside a circle” paint-stroke crystallizes new communal stance with felt cost of secrecy Maya must carry. Persistent constraint visible: future raids still possible, archive coordinates hidden; gentrification slowed, not vanquished.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is more than postcard: salt-fried air, clashing float-music, neon fish murals that double as nautical charts—details filter through Maya’s pattern-seeking gaze. The perpetual carnival physically constrains tactics (noise hides meetings, crowd conceals painters). Micro-setting objects—earpiece, stone chip, spray-can—are handled, traded, relinquished with changing emotional weight. Final painted spiral inside circle reuses earlier motif, now re-weighted as secret archive key.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve carnival culture against privatization—tightens through mural decryption, flash-mob timing, and covert counter-offer; each act raises personal risk. One clear reversal: council notice shifts from expected eviction to “surprisingly favorable terms,” yet victory is partial and fragile, maintaining pressure. Persistent cost: Maya’s anonymity, ongoing secrecy, outer-raft concession. Agency stays internal: decoding, painting, teaching; no coincidences solve core threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: collective memory encoded in public art can out-maneuver corporate time-tables. Resonance refrains from sermon—no character proclaims “Art saves cities”; instead, final image of children hop-scotching over hidden archive coordinates lets theme linger as lived possibility. Subtext of water-memory vs. land-forgetfulness threads through without overt explanation. Ambiguity accepted: partial win, secrets kept, city still floating, never moralized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory synesthesia (“music…clashed,” “scent…mingled”) filtered through pattern-seeking, synesthetic mind. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses for all-night mapping, longer cadence for dawn notice scene. No head-hopping; single POV stays interior yet embodied. Diction stays within carnival lexicon—no academic drift; elders “nod knowingly,” paint “blossoms,” never explains graffiti codes academically.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs (“clutched,” “slipped,” “nailed”) keep momentum. Information density high: one sentence can set place, stake, sensory clash. One mixed-metaphor watch-spot—“splash of cold water” revelation amid salt-air carnival—reads intentional, not slip. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; final-line spiral/circle image concise, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of carnival-flotation, generational graffiti-cipher, and gentrification resistance feels fresh; not a standard template. Specificity of “orange translator earpiece” as culture-shock badge, neon fish murals doubling as nautical charts, stone chip returned to monument—details resist swap-out. Risky structural compression (three nights in two sentences) pays off by keeping focus on encoded victory rather than process minutiae. Ending image—spiral inside circle—adds symbolic layer without previously lecturing on spirals.</comment>
