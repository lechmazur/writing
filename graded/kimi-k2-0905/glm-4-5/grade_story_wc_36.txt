<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eldrin’s interiority is concrete and character-particular; trembling hands, the weight of boots on stones, the decision to kneel and place each stick—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (pride vs. shame, duty vs. release) are held simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses the path of control and opens healing. The only tiny slip: “avalanchingly quiet” risks poetic overkill twice, but it is filtered through his self-accusatory ear so the voice remains coherent. Closure cost is legible—flute lighter yet more precious, driftwood returned, silence now internal—so the 9+ bar is met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral of driftwood and the escalating flute sequences tighten the same stake—how to live after failure—until the cadence shift in the final note reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise: pearlescent air, tears washing guilt, silence transmuted; the cost is the guardianship path forever closed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside the first 90 words; no disorientation. One driftwood-to-stream beat returns each stick to its source, crystallizing the before/after legible in a single image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is not backdrop; its avalanch hush and telluric fissures literally shape where Eldrin can place each marker and how sound propagates—environment as constraint. The gilded reed flute itself functions as micro-setting: its gold etchings, weight change, and sonic physics are handled on-page and charge the final image. Sensory economy is perfect—cold stone, swift stream, pale light—each detail mirrors or contrasts his internal freeze/thaw. No setting detail exceeds the scene’s needs; world rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to live after catastrophic failure”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each flute note that strips away delusion. The spiral layout forms the meaningful tightening: every stick placed narrows the cognitive map until the only remaining option is surrender to the music. Cost is visible—tears, lighter flute, returned driftwood—yet the price is emotional/spiritual rather than a forgone object; this keeps it just below the 8.8 gate that requires a persistent material constraint. Still, agency is pure: no coincidence, only self-driven ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: failure itself is the relic that must be kept, not discarded. The returning image of “avalanchingly quiet” migrates from external landscape to internal silence, reweighting the premise. No moralizing paragraph; the final image of footprints walking away under a self-carried canyon hush offers conceptual repricing. Wisdom is harvested from concrete particulars—driftwood, flute overtones, pearlescent air—avoiding pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eldrin’s perceptual signature: ancient stones “beneath worn boots,” sound that “seemed to grow exponentially,” guilt that “echoed endlessly.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-length of flute phrases; diction never drifts above his temple-keeper lexicon. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. The single epithet “avalanchingly quiet” is repeated with self-aware ceremonial intent, pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm mimics inhalations of flute breaths—long evocative clauses alternate with terse placements of sticks. Metaphors (avalanche, pearlescence) stay physically coherent within mountain acoustics. Information density is high: “weight…pressing…like ancient stones” fuses body, guilt, geology in one stroke. Final line cadence—“the canyon hush remained within him”—delivers closure without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Uses familiar redemption arc yet makes it specific: sonic geometry of mountain pass + driftwood calculus + trans-realm flute creates a fresh synthesis. Risk lies in lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals; the gamble pays off when silence turns artifact. Not 9+ only because “failed guardian seeks absolution” is a known spine, but the acoustical ritual is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
