<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s warmly inquisitive trait is shown through concrete, story-driving acts: retrieving the goggles, pocketing the diary, angling it to scattered light. Each micro-choice tightens her mission and forecloses the option of remaining a passive servant. Interiority stays sensorial, not therapeutic—goggles cold on skin, diary pages resistant—so affection and detachment coexist without label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the decrypted book) is earned by every beat since floor two; cost is visible when she carries the captain’s secret silently back into uniform.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density, diary+goggles pattern taught by 120 words, crystalline imagery recurs with escalating weight. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored immediately inside the elevator; no debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scattered-light decryption crystallizes her understanding and reweights servitude into stewardship. Cost is palpable—she descends still a servant but now bearing invisible knowledge she can never speak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire is not backdrop but constraint: elevator mechanism, fracturing light, and cold leather directly enable the decryption tactic. Micro-setting (goggles, diary, crystalline window) functions as interactive tools rather than scenic decoration. Spatial choreography inside the moving car is impeccable; no floating props. Final image—deck windows showing “endless sky” she can now see through two lenses—recharges the motif and would collapse if relocated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible by floor two: can Elira decode the captain’s anguish without losing her place? Pressure tightens once per floor via accretion of physical and emotional detail; no coincidence required. The decryption beat (7→10) is the single meaningful intensification that forecloses ignorance and forces her to carry his secret. Cost is visible: silent descent, uniform readjusted, path sealed into quiet custodianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—servitude as covert witness—emerges through pattern, not assertion. Goggles shift from captain’s shield to servant’s lens, reconfiguring class boundaries. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the sky she now sees contains two skies, yet she must walk groundward in silence. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the tension between ascension and custody.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is servant-sharp: notice what others miss, catalogue tactile minutiae—cold strap, humming elevator, resistant pages. Rhythmic control mirrors ascent: shorter clauses as decryption nears, longer reflective cadences on descent. Filter verbs serve voice (“she considered,” “she recalled”) without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “crystalline walls fracturing the light into scattered patterns” seeds both setting and decryption method. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, deliberate. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removing any elevator floor would erase causal step. Final line lands with crisp, image-driven cadence that recharges “scattered light” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—missing captain, encrypted journal, servant sleuth—are freshened by integrating decryption physics into elevator optics and class stratification. Specificity of ten-floor counter as clock, ice-spire as vertical kingdom, goggles as dual-sight device makes the synthesis feel inevitable. Risk is quiet: lyric accumulation rather than twist, but coherence never wavers. Without these exact objects and setting, emotional payoff collapses.</comment>
