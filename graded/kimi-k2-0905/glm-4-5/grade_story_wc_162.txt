<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-borne perseverance and father-fixation are vivid; her “featherly” bodying of determination (dust-mote/stepping-through-water) keeps contradiction alive. Interiority is concrete but leans toward label-speak (“sacred geometry,” “thresholds of transformation”) that blunts raw edge. One strong micro-choice—touching the oak doorway—triggers the final memory, yet the climactic forgiveness is delivered paternalistically rather than wrested. Cost is felt but not visibly paid by her body; the embrace is sweet, not earned through visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the maze of drifting shards and timber patterns builds density toward the threshold-doorway. Closure is Charged Poise: “Home” reconfigures meaning and the corn breeze crystallizes cost. Orientation is clean inside its lyric compression; drifted terrace, logbook, and oak door are legible anchors. The lens holds; love’s return is the unavoidable repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting rule satisfied: the logbook’s shifting symbols and the oak-grain pattern physically constrain Elara’s final step and charge the image. Prismatic light, violet pillars, and corn-snap breeze are selectively sensory, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean across a reality that dissolves and re-forms. The terrace’s “fractured hush” mirrors her bereft attention and pays off when silence breaks into remembered wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bridge the “necessary distances” between lost and found—threads every beat; the tightening arrives as the oak doorway narrows infinite drift into one irreversible step. Cost is conceptual (accepting death-drift) rather than viscerally paid; the price could be sharper on the body. Escalation is steady pattern-accumulation under Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent, agency is decision-to-cross. One deepening is sufficient and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mazes outward = mazes inward; sacred thresholds are the exits we brave to re-enter love. Subtext lives in image—corn breeze replacing fractured hush—avoiding preach tag-lines. “Home” as final symbol reweights prior codes without sermonizing. Complexity is honored: reunion is tender but not erasure of grief; ambiguity lingers in the infinite terrace left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at dream-distance, taught early by “distances seem both infinite and meaningless.” Syntax glides with light anaphora and soft alliteration that breathes rather than drums. Perceptual signature—architect’s daughter reading wood grain as runes—remains consistent, never drifting into explanatory overtalk. Voice modulates: clauses lengthen when awe thickens, shorten on the single-word reveal “Home,” mirroring breath-catch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“The necessary distances…”) repeats concept without new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within prism-terrace physics; no mixed vehicles. High information density achieved via compressed participial phrases that layer sight, sound, and memory. One filter-verb cluster (“had become,” “had begun”) softens urgency but does not stall the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Father-daughter maze mythology is familiar, but the pilot-logbook-as-weather-code and drift-terrace as living corn-maze are fresh inflections. Butterfly-effect liminal landscape risks trend echo yet justifies itself through wood-grain cartography. Conceptual risk—mourning mapped as sacred topology—pays off in the corn-wind return, feeling earned rather than gimmick. Specificity of oak-grain matching logbook symbol rescues premise from abstraction.</comment>
