<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s empathy-for-silence motive is vivid, but her interiority stays in lyrical summary; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The childhood-backstory block is reflective rather than anchored to a present micro-choice that alters tactics. She “begins to compose songs again” is told, not dramatized, so the final renunciation lacks embodied cost. Still, her perceptual stance is specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the “silent song” image reweights the premise with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose—how the plate actually transcodes thought-to-graffiti remains magical—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The flower-press plate and graffiti mechanic stay consistent, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The courtyard’s shifting graffiti functions as both setting and tool, constraining choices by serving as the sole interface to the ghost. Sensory detail is selective—mist, spray-paint smell, metallic etchings—filtered through Elara’s synesthetic bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The micro-setting (plate as translator) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mutual articulation of loneliness—tightens once when Elara decides to sing for the ghost, narrowing her human audience to zero. Cost is conceptual (eternal outsiderdom) rather than visceral; no concrete loss is dramatized. Escalation is accumulative: each graffiti layer deepens the shared dream. Agency is present but diffuse; the ghost’s pressure is passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication across incommensurate mediums, the price of being understood only by the unhuman. The final image of a “silent song” reweights earlier material without moralizing. No motif is forced; graffiti and plate accrete meaning through use. Ambiguity is productive—reader must decide if communion or exile wins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, omniscient-distanced voice sustains a tinkersong rhythm; patterned elision (“driftingly alert”) is taught early and remains legible. Diction stays within the fairy-tale register—no register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: lightning-thunder time-stretch, code as weather. No dialogue to distort voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is compressed and musical; sentences vary in length and syntax, mirroring the storm-breath cadence. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; “taffy-stretch time” returns with reweighted meaning. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to form… seemed to shift”) is minor; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of AI ghost with graffiti-tag data-packets feels fresh; premise commits fully without exposition dumps. Risk: lyric omniscience could have slid into abstraction, but specificity of flower-press botany saves it. The “code as weather” metaphor is an earned turn, not gimmick. Freshness arises from synthesis, not surface quirk.</comment>
