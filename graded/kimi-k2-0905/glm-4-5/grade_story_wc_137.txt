<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical warmth is credibly embodied—she presses and rotates the tile rather than merely “believing.” Interior contradiction is light; her shift from private transcription to communal invitation is earned, yet the cost of that openness (lost solitude, possible ridicule) is asserted more than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tile patterns and whale songs layer until the tower becomes a sanctuary. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tower stays open, an ongoing passage with felt opportunity-cost. The “because” chain is loose, but the density-reconfiguration satisfies the lens at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tower and tile function as micro-setting: access to night sky and migrating whales directly enables the tile’s harmonic revelations. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and celestial motion constrain when meetings happen. Detail is filtered through Elara’s astronomy lineage, anchoring mood without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shared connection versus skeptical solitude—tightens once when Elara opens the tower to strangers. The price (permanent exposure, derelict privacy) is visible in the final open-door image. Pressure is accumulative: each transcription session thickens the ethical obligation to share; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: memory is communal, not private, like whale song traveling miles. The unheard symphony reweights at closure—visitors now “remember” experiences never lived. No moral is stated; the silence after the last whale crests the horizon stands as quiet repricing of solitude itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s scientifically tinged diction: “astronomical chart,” “conduit,” “cosmic.” Rhythm modulates—long cadences for starlit reverie, clipped fragments during tactile tile presses. No dialogue, so voice distinction relies on perceptual signature; it holds, though secondary voices (visitors) are reported, not rendered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid yet occasionally loops: “Through forgotten patterns” is repeated four times with minimal re-inflection; each could carry new sensorium but doesn’t. No mixed metaphors, but scaffold phrases (“quiet revelation,” “spaces in between”) dull immediacy. Clarity remains high; momentum never stalls fatally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of star-map, whale migration, and memory-entangling tile feels novel; the tile as communal archive reframes the grandmother’s legacy trope. Risk lies in lyric repetition; it doesn’t fully transform across beats, leaving some inevitability unearned. Specificity of astronomy-whale interface keeps it from drifting into generic magic-object tale.</comment>
