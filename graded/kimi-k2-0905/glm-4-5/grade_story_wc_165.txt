<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leo’s “analytical” tag is shown only in summary; the one on-page micro-choice—dropping the bishop—reads as rehearsed routine, not active calculation under pressure. Interiority drifts into editorial commentary (“he congratulated himself”) rather than embodied contradiction. The token gift costs him nothing visible; the woman’s tears pay the emotional price, so the cost is displaced, not felt by the agent. The characterization remains pleasant but does not earn a higher band because the decisive beat lacks a palpable personal stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the bishop’s passage reweights serendipity from Leo’s private rule-set to public gift, with social cost legible in the woman’s stunned tears. Causal lattice holds: early drop → planted quartet → gift transfer, each step “because/therefore.” Orientation is secure inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices for this length, but the cost is borne by the recipient, not the protagonist, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is evoked through acoustic and reflective specifics—flooded marble mirroring stars—that directly enable Leo’s tactics (sound, visual misdirection). Weather and spatial layout are tracked without drift; the bishop’s small scale substitutes for macro geography. Setting subtly guides choice: the flooded floor hides the drop, the glass ceiling amplifies music. The environment does not charge the final image (the woman’s tear-stained exit), so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—manufacture wonder for strangers—is signaled early; escalation is a single soft turn (music starts) rather than a narrowing of Leo’s options. Pressure is observational, not adversarial; no credible loss or tool forfeiture alters his next move. Coincidence (quartet timing) is allowed under Situational lens but cannot resolve; here it delivers the payoff, so agency feels external. Cost is present only in the woman’s emotional release, not in Leo’s tactical world, capping the band at mid-6.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: engineered wonder versus authentic feeling. The bishop’s migration from prop to gift reweights the concept of “orchestrated serendipity” without authorial sermon. Subtext sits in the silent hand-off and the quartet’s unannounced arrival, not exposition. Ambiguity is preserved—reader can applaud or doubt Leo’s manipulation—earning a solid 7-band; lacks a final sting to push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Leo’s perceptual filter; diction (“calculated wilderness,” “diagonal movements”) mirrors his chess-metaphor mind. No head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance modulates cleanly between external action and interior planning. Distinctiveness is moderate—voice leans on conceptual phrasing rather than sensual idiosyncrasy—hence mid-7 rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between long reflective sentences and crisp micro-actions, sustaining momentum. Figurative language is controlled: no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. One paraphrase loop—“orchestrated serendipity” restated three times—dings −0.2. Otherwise clean scaffolding, precise verbs, and sensory economy. Closure image (“stars…conspirators”) is concise and charged, keeping the score in high-7 territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “street-magician-engineers-moments” premise is familiar, yet the tidal arcade’s flooding floor and star-mirrored acoustics give it a fresh, locally specific twist. Bishop-as-token transferred to stranger provides a crisp, non-obvious payoff. Execution avoids cliché, but conceptual frame remains within recognizable territory; no bold structural or moral risk is taken. Sufficient originality for upper-7 band, not quite the startling synthesis required for 8.8+.</comment>
