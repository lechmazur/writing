<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arthur’s interiority is concrete—his gift of hearing unspoken thoughts is shown through specific whispers (“Why must we do everything this way?”) that tilt his stance. The micro-choice to use the grotto amplifies his ability and foreshadows the plan. His final smile is a credible renunciation of silence, paid for by three weeks of secrecy. One slip: “forests of second thoughts” is used three times without fresh embodiment, a faint echo of label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn windows reweight the town’s rule-set, visible cost is the audible shift from resignation to wonder Arthur hears in the magnetic grotto. Causal chain holds: whispers → grotto amplification → plan → dawn displays → changed soundscape. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation (mist, cobalt light, starlight underground) is taught early and pays off in the final image. Persistent constraint: Arthur’s gift never lets him stop listening, shaping every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its field literally lets Arthur hear the stakes. Starlight underground recharges the crystal and the final image. “Cobalt library,” “narrow streets,” and “dissolving mist” are reused with precision, anchoring choreography. One near-slip: “windows glowing with an otherworldly blue hue” skirts cliché, but the color recurs as cobalt dawn, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving curiosity—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when Arthur realizes the whispers are a collective plea. The reversal is the town’s audible shift from silence to debate; Arthur’s agency is the synchronized puzzle gambit. Cost is legible: he risks being discovered by the same librarian-accomplice who could expose him. Persistent constraint: he must keep listening, even when the new soundscape overwhelms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the literalization of “second thoughts” as chess positions that refuse solution. The final image—students as “fellow thinkers”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: Arthur cradling the crystal is both comfort and weapon. No tidy thesis; the town’s new noise is left ethically ambiguous, amplifying resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Arthur’s perceptual signature—wire-rimmed glasses, mist as “almost tangible,” starlight as “special aperture.” Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for grotto awe, clipped fragments for dawn execution. No dialogue, so voice carries the subtext of revolt in quiet diction. One hairline slip: “humble rebellion” is repeated verbatim, a faint template echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—every sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Figurative layers (“forests of second thoughts,” “concrete of routine”) are limited to three, avoiding purple drift. No paraphrase loops; “cobalt” anchors color without synonym churn. Final line crystallizes without scaffolding: “great game of life” is earned by prior chess motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—telepathic chess coach uses unfinished puzzles as civic intervention—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high: quiet revolt via storefront dioramas could read as twee, but specificity of magnetic grotto and audible cost grounds it. Transformation test fails if Arthur is swapped for generic teacher—his gift is irreplaceable. Fresh synthesis: rebellion through invitation, not confrontation.</comment>
