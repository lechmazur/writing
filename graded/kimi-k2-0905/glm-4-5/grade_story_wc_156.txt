<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing a chipped violinist’s face while mentally calculating paint ratios” shows embodied expertise—but the five abstract “awakenings” are declared rather than dramatized, so the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity feels imposed, not earned by visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the nickel back completes an unseen circle and reweights her vocation (“curiosity would be her new guide”) with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each sonic pulse adds density rather than forcing external turns, and the pattern holds cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is sketched with selective synesthesia—“sound waves pulsed,” “patterns she could almost see rippling”—and the mural crevice that yields the nickel functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the next discovery; spatial anchors arrive early and track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she abandon rigid restoration for synesthetic creation?—is signaled early; pressure escalates through each “awakening” that narrows her old method’s viability. Yet the cost is largely declarative (“certainty dissolving”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on the page, capping tension at the high-mid band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as frozen music awaiting perceptual ignition—emerges from the nickel’s sonic reflections and the final image of a humming mural, avoiding explicit thesis. The nested structure mirrors the idea, but the repeated “awakening” labels flirt with thematic echo, keeping the score just shy of the 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s synesthetic lens; diction (“brush dancing playfully,” “gentle rain” of sound) carries a consistent rhythmic lift that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; the only minor slip is the slightly over-poetic “time itself had drawn breath,” which momentarily externalizes what should stay perceptual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive—sentence variety and sensory density keep momentum—but three adjacent “pause between question and reply” refrains create template cadence; the figurative layering never collapses into mixed metaphor, but the repetition dulls the final third enough to block the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The hobo nickel as acoustic lens that converts mural to living score is a fresh synthesis of tactile restoration and synesthetic sound; the concept commits fully without late rule changes. Risk lies in the abstract escalation, but specificity of Elena’s craft keeps it from feeling like a gimmick, landing in the low-8 range.</comment>
