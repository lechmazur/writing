<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maven’s yearning for “the shape of home” is vivid and embodied in her nightly feather ritual, but the interior contradiction between passive drifting and active world-shaping is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final epiphany feels lightly earned because no prior choice visibly risks or costs her anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile engagement with feather and stone thickens the bookstore’s reality until the mountain dissolves into the nexus image; the closure beat—“home wasn’t a place at all, but the connections between places”—carries conceptual cost because the rotunda she stands in is literally erased, foreclosing her old exile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mercury glass, raven feather, and shifting shelves are handled, weighed, and stroked; these micro-settings constrain every beat and charge the final image when the feather’s plume becomes the map she now carries inside her skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens once: the buried talent is awakened and immediately used to re-sculpt the corridors; the cost is the bookstore’s erasure and her irrevocable relocation into the nexus, but the escalation is singular rather than deepening, keeping the stake vivid yet not multi-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the accumulating tactile images of mirrors, feathers, and pages; the final reconfiguration—home as connective tissue rather than location—reweights every prior alcove-sitting beat without moralizing, landing as Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maven’s perceptual filter—paper-scent, heartbeat-synced hum, silver light on mercury; syntax lengthens and compresses with her pulse, teaching the reader the feather-stone pattern early and paying it off in the dissolving rotunda.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional adjective stacks (“labyrinthine corridors of bookstore that stretched deep within the ancient mountain”) slightly dilute momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat, keeping the final image crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “bookstore-mountain as multiversal hinge” is fresh, yet the raven-feather map and mercury mirror feel like inherited talismans; the synthesis gains originality through the tactile grammar that turns texture into topology, but the iconography stops just short of revelation.</comment>
