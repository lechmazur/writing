<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—public theatrical narration vs. private blankness—is vivid and embodied in the micro-gesture of touching a brittle petal. His motive (lightness in grief) drives every whittling beat and is visibly costed by the flakes of wood and petals he loses. The endurance/renunciation closure is earned: he refuses to sell the figures, accepting perpetual solitude as price. Only flaw: no second on-page character means relationship crucible and status dynamics are absent by scope, not failure.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving/petal layer adds density until the final figure reweights the stake—permission to feel. Closure is a Charged Poise: “a remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 4; no penalty. One minor loop: “layers of…” repeated twice in 60 words (−0.2). Cost is legible in the refused sale and the ever-thinning block of pine.</comment>

<comment>The cracked mason jar of dried petals functions as micro-setting: it constrains his daily ritual and is handled in four distinct beats, charging the final image when flakes fall “like snow.” Wind-turbine moan supplies sonic pressure that sharpens the hush. Spatial choreography is immaculate—table, knife, cup, jar—across one continuous scene. Weather (turbine drone) directly shapes his coinage “remade hush,” qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—permission to grieve—is signaled early and tightens through each carved figure that re-legalizes a banned emotion. Escalation is textural: the bouquet dwindles, wood shavings accumulate, visitors multiply; each intensifies the cost of refusal. No causal reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Visible price: the final figure’s expressive face costs him the last intact petal, foreclosing perfect preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated particulars: petal flakes = outlawed sorrow; whittled faces = repatriated emotions. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: “remade hush” = forgiveness for feeling. Subtext in gesture: touching brittle petals implies fragility of recovered grief. No abstract thesis statements; the single near-abstraction “theater of existence” is character-voiced, not authorial. Resonance lingers as ambiguity: is he saint or fraud? Answer refused—cost felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close tracks the blank face’s perceptual bias: he notices grain knots, turbine rhythms, petal dust—never crowd opinions. Syntax is carved-short like whittling strokes: “Every stroke… carried purpose.” Theatrical cadence in spoken lines (“Now I shall quench my thirst”) is intentionally performed, not narrator overwriting. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress to tactile micro-movements. Pattern-taught elision (“mandate years” left vague) pays off in conceptual reprice at end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mimics blade strokes: short, declarative, then elongates during turbine moans. Information density high—one sentence often marries action, metaphor, backstory (“This knot… mandate’s lie”). No scaffold loops; only two adjacent “layers of” repeats (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent: wood = emotional censorship, petals = banned mourning. Final line “like forgiveness” risks soft abstract but is earned by prior concrete flakes and figures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the ubiquitous “forced happiness” dystopia into post-collapse aftermath, focusing on grief-recovery craft. Whittling as protest against oblivion freshens standard resistance tropes. Dried flowers repurposed from décor to criminal evidence to relic currency. Risk: blank-face performer could read as gimmick, but sustained tactile detail and refused saint/fraud labels keep it human. Synthesis feels inevitable: craftsman + turbines + petal dust = new quiet.</comment>
