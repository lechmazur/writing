<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “benevolently ruthless” historian drive is dramatized through the obsessive floor-spelling walks and the tactile moment she touches the lone pawn; the interior contradiction between gentleness and ferocity is present but stays at summary level until the final beat, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s echo-pattern and reweights the pawn’s absence until the single returned pawn crystallizes the “luminous absence” closure with felt cost—memory reclaimed at the price of acknowledging thousands lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic loop and the nomadic penumbra’s light-eating edge are rendered through Elara’s footfall-echo synesthesia; the chessboard’s pawn void literally guides her next walking pattern, charging the final image when the pawn reappears.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from abstract memory-loss to the concrete return of one pawn; the escalating pattern forces Elara to confront that she can save only symbolic fragments, a trade-off made visceral in the final tableau.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of micro-history vs. erasure emerges through the repeating pawn image rather than thesis statements; the closing “luminous absence” re-prices the value of a single pawn as avatar for the disappeared, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly archaic diction (“incantation,” “penumbra,” “interregnum”) stays inside Elara’s historian-poet consciousness; rhythm swells and hushes with the gallery’s breath-like cadence, teaching the reader to hear echo as text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally precise, but sporadic abstract clusters (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) verge on purple when stacked; no loops stall momentum, yet one mixed metaphor (“penumbra swirled hungrily”) slightly blurs physical logic at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The memory-foraging walker who literally spells history into stone is a fresh angle on post-catastrophe witness; the pawn-as-archive trope is revitalized by tying its return to her kinetic alphabet rather than magic.</comment>
