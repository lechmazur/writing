<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria’s gift for noticing creeping normality is clear, but her interior contradiction—curiosity vs. fear of trespass—stays off-page; the moment at the cottage only restates her calm certainty. The final “smile” is performed emotion that feels unearned after zero embodied struggle. Micro-choices (placing objects) never risk failure or social cost, so the sanctifying quest reads as pre-decided routine, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shard reweights the premise—houses breathe because love leaves displaced echoes—visible in the instant the three objects glow. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via collecting ritual, cadence deepens at lighthouse, cost is the irreversible shift in how Aria will now inhabit every future dawn. One causality seam: how she “identified” the shard as orris root is told in summary, not shown, slightly dulling the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bay-town predawn is economically anchored by dew, streetlight color, and pulsing cottage walls; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that drinks sound, constraining Aria’s perception in the final beat. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound hush > visual glow) mirrors the thematic question of presence vs. emptiness. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single continuous walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode why houses feel alive—tightens once when the shard’s pocket of silence reweights her tactics; the glow moment crystallizes that attachment lingers in displaced objects. Cost is conceptual: she now must keep wandering, never settling, a quiet forfeiture legible in the final line. No tangible price (time, money, social credit) is risked, keeping escalation intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—love’s residue haunts space—emerges from the accumulating pattern of displaced objects rather than declaration. Final image of “every house seemed to breathe more deeply” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Sentimentality is dodged by keeping the insight oblique; the smile is the only wobble, a flick toward neat emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Aria notices “houses breathed while others merely occupied space,” a bias that suffuses every detail. Rhythmic control under pressure—long languid clauses that mimic predawn drowse, then clipped fragments at glow instant—mirrors her hushed blaze. No dialogue, so no register clash; diction stays within a lone night-walker’s lexicon. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she understood”) are sparse and voice-motivated, preserving immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence music is varied; no template cadence detected. Occasional soft filler—“seemed to,” “almost”—slows propulsion but never clusters. Metaphor chain (streetlights daydream, shard drinks sound) is coherent and paid off. No paraphrase loops; information density is high, each sentence advancing atmosphere or concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—houses as emotional lung-systems animated by displaced love-shards—is fresh yet emotionally inevitable. Risk: choosing an almost dialogue-free lyric accumulative structure pays off when the final glow reframes every prior object-drop. Transformation test fails only in late-breaking orris-root ID; otherwise particulars are inseparable from this bay, this walker, this dawn.</comment>
