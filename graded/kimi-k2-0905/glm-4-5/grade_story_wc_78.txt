<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s motive is legible—transform peril into music—but her interior contradiction is described rather than staged; the moment she “smiled as the blue hour faded” summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost of unending vigilance. The children’s inherited mallets signal generational endurance, yet no on-page micro-choice tests her willingness to pass the burden. Earned stasis is implied, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard drifts on, humming with residual sound, a charged poise that forecloses rest. The accumulative/textural lens holds—density of sound/cloud imagery tightens until the storm skirts them—though the cost is poetic rather than corporeal. One causal leap: the storm “skirts” because music redirected it reads more symbolic than meteorological.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating driftwood orchard is tactile—roots “conduct vibrations,” mallet strikes “ripple” through trunks—so setting becomes instrument and constraint. Blue-hour mercury sea and fractal clouds are filtered through the prophet’s synesthetic perception, anchoring who/where inside 120 words. The final image of the crescent-moon hook crystallizes the orchard as living metronome, satisfying 9+ micro-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival—signals early; pressure escalates via denser sonic patterns rather than external reversals. Agency is attention and endurance, not decisive gamble; the storm diverts off-stage, muting visible cost. Fractal cloud-reading and sketched resonance function as accumulative deepening that reweights the stake, but the price feels aesthetic rather than material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—obstacles as instruments—through recurring sonic imagery rather than authorial statement. The closing image of children inheriting mallets reframes survival as symphony, avoiding moralism. Subtext resides in the silence between strikes: perpetual vigilance replaces rest, a cost felt but not sermonized. Ambiguity lingers—salvation or cage—earning complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric retains perceptual signature: clouds “fractal generating,” ocean “mercury,” prose rhythms echo xylophone arpeggios. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Compression (“longer than memory served”) taught early and paid off in inherited mallets. Register drifts slightly elevated for drifting orchard denizens, but diction remains internally consistent and pattern-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence mirrors musical subject—varied sentence lengths, percussive verbs (“tapping,” “striking,” “rippled”). Only minor artifact: “sketched resonance” appears three times in final third without new inflection, a 0.3 loop. Metaphors stay coherent (sound = weather path). No mixed registers or purple overload; high density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard-as-instrument, cloud-reading via xylophone, and perpetual blue-hour vigilance synthesize into a fresh mythic logic. Risk of lyric stasis is countered by sonic causality that feels internally inevitable. No recognizable template; prophet trope is retooled through acoustic meteorology. Specific detail—roots as sound conductors—anchors novelty in sensory fact.</comment>
