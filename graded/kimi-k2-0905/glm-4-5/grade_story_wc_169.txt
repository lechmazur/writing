<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Elian’s “logical dreamer” identity is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory impulse or risky miscalculation; the interiority is abstract (“logical mind warred with dreaming heart”) rather than dramatized. Micro-choices—positioning decorations, adjusting weights—are meticulous yet emotionally flat, so the promised fusion of logic/dream feels declared, not performed. The final shift is purely epiphanic, lacking an on-page mistake or renunciation that would cost him something visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gauge steadies on Elian, signalling that his equations have “found purchase” across timelines; the cost is conceptual—he now bears the weight of multiplied possibility—so RR is valid. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the single scene holds. Causality is soft (Accumulative/Textural lens): pattern density escalates until the needle locks, not because/therefore. No meaningful tightening inside the beat—decorative rearrangements don’t narrow live options—so escalation is present but gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The tide-polished grotto is vividly sensory—prismatic reflections, rhythmic algae glow—and functions as micro-setting: retreating water reveals new surfaces that literally allow the next adjustment, so environment constrains action. The altitude gauge as recurring object charges the final image when it points outward, re-weighting earlier readings. Spatial choreography stays clean despite dense props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“revitalize possibility itself”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete personal loss or ticking clock sharpens it. Pressure accumulates via sensory density (spinning needle, shifting light) rather than a narrowing choice; the final moment is crystallization, not trade-off. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt, keeping escalation moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: pattern-making as fragile engineering of hope. The reprise of “trial balloons” in the final paragraph reconfigures earlier decoration-work from quixotic to effective, giving the reader an after-image of gentle upheaval. No moral is stated; the soap-bubble grotto keeps ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices angles, algorithms, tidal intervals. Syntax flexes with pressure (“needle drawing faster circles than Elian had ever witnessed”). No head-hopping; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; figurative language is restrained and voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical templates. Some near-paraphrase pairs (“creating patterns with decorations… each decoration represented a variable”) but not adjacent, so loops are minor. Occasional elevated register (“с новой науки”) feels unmotivated; otherwise clarity is high. No mixed metaphors; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of quantum-timeline logic with tide-carved cave craft feels fresh; the altitude gauge as multiverse compass is a specific, non-obvious object. Risk is quiet—lyric interior, no antagonist—but cohesion is complete. The concept commits fully without retreat; transformation test passed: swap setting or object and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
