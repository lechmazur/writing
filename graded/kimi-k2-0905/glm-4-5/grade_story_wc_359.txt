<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eira’s synesthetic lens gives her interiority texture—color-sound cross-wiring shapes every micro-choice, never abstracted. The weight-of-legacy motive is visceral: “amber music sheet pulsing… energy of ancient wisdom” makes inherited obligation felt in her palms. The final renunciation—lowered hands, luminous sheet—pays the cost of bearing witness, foreclosing any return to ordinary silence. Flaws: no contradictory impulse in scene, and the interior arithmetic (“certify wonder as essential”) edges toward thesis-speak mid-text.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each bell-strike layers chromatic density until the cavern itself becomes a resonant instrument. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“heart of the glacial cathedral”); no debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpted hush blooms into a silence the crowd can taste—undeniable conceptual cost. The tightening is single but sufficient: the last chord fuses every prior color into white, reweighting perception itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice cavern is no postcard; refractive geometry dictates where Eira can stand, which bell she must strike next. The amber sheet’s warmth against sub-zero flesh is a micro-setting that constrains grip and tempo. Spatial choreography is flawless—bells suspended, observers at mouth, aurora overhead—tracked across every gesture. One slip: “frozen valleys below” is the only exterior anchor; had it returned in the hush’s aftermath, the image would have charged even harder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—signaled in paragraph 5 and tested by every audible hue. Pressure escalates by accrual: each new bell-color narrows the possible silences until only the sculpted hush remains. No antagonist needed; the risk is experiential failure—crowd remains numb. Cost is legible: Eira’s final stillness is not triumph but exhaustion, the sheet now “brilliant with captured light” implying irreversible spent energy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence into palpable presence, never named as “theme of wonder.” The amber sheet’s generational pulse reframes wonder as civic infrastructure, not luxury. Final image—tasting silence—re-prices the premise: perception itself is rebuilt. Avoids 9-band because the penultimate paragraph’s “proving irrefutably” flirts with explicit thesis; a quieter ripple would have let the image alone reweight.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tethered to Eira’s synesthetic sensorium; diction (“prism-song,” “sculpted hush”) is concept-driven yet internally consistent. Rhythm swells with clause-length that mirrors chromatic crescendo, then fractures into shorter breaths at the hush climax. No head-hopping; crowd reaction is filtered strictly through Eira’s perception of their tasted silence. Filter-verb count is low; when used (“she could fully perceive”) they serve stress, not padding.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: periodic sentences rise and break like auroral waves; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—indigo as “distant stars” maintains light-sound continuum. Information-dense: one sentence can layer bell-strike, color, temperature, heritage. Only micro-loop: “wonder made manifest… essential to the human spirit” restates prior beat; trims −0.2. Closure sentence is artifact-free, pure image recharge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia + cathedral of ice + silence-as-sculpture creates a non-obvious ritual. The “sculpted hush” concept refiles negative space into tactile art, risking reader skepticism yet landing through sensory specificity. Risk heightens stakes: if the silence had stayed metaphorical the piece would collapse; instead it becomes tasteable, reconfiguring the reader’s body. Transformation test passed—this exact premise could not swap names or places without disintegration.</comment>
