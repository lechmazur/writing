<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elion’s benevolent stasis is clear, but Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait is asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice shows why she alone bridges worlds. Interiority is generic (“quiet conviction”) and the ghost’s non-corporeal limits never complicate his plan—no visible cost or flaw drives a mistake. The ending’s communal euphoria is sweet but unearned: we are told trust deepens, not shown a beat where it might have cracked. Closure lands as feel-good summary, not character-driven renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is present—planet saved, ghost fades—but the decisive change occurs off-stage: the larvae miracle is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. Causality is linear and smooth (chalk → discovery → bell → revival), yet the midpoint lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option; escalation is additive, not consequential. Orientation is clear by word 50, but the lens drifts from causal to accumulative without a pattern taught early, muting final resonance. No persistent constraint or price shapes the last image, capping resonance at “pleasant” rather than “indelible.”</comment>

<comment>Floating rock arches and violet sunsets are vivid but decorative; only the watering bell actively constrains choice, earning its keep in two beats. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—and the orchard’s spatial layout is never tested under pressure; we never feel a body navigating rows or heights. The nebula’s shimmer is repeated like a screensaver rather than evolving with stakes. Still, the bell’s tactile detail (seed-pod shape, larval mist) supplies enough specificity to anchor the miracle moment.</comment>

<comment>Stakes—crop failure, communal survival—are declared early and coherent, yet pressure plateaus after the first chalk message; each new note merely affirms the same directive. The single reversal (Aris finally digs) is delayed but not complicated by new risk or trade-off; success feels pre-ordained. No resource is lost, no relationship strained, no belief questioned on-page; the “brambled hope” tone claims setbacks that never materialize. Escalation is therefore textural—more messages, more believers—rather than causal or costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of interdependence between living and spirit emerges organically through the bell’s symbiosis, avoiding overt thesis. The final spring-solstice echo offers a resonant reprise, but the sentiment (“strangers became family”) is stated, not reweighted by a fresh image or irony. Subtext is thin: chalked directives carry no double meaning, and the ghost’s loneliness remains unexplored. Still, the butterfly-larvae metaphor for communal pollination is lovely and particular, saving the piece from generic moralism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains a gentle, folkloric distance suited to myth; diction is consistent, with pleasing rhythmic lifts (“brambled hope,” “tangled roots”). Because no character speaks, dialogue pitfalls are avoided; the ghost’s chalk voice could have offered subtext but is kept utilitarian. Free-indirect style is clean, though Aris’s perceptions never color the prose with idiosyncratic bias. The collective “they” lens in later paragraphs dilutes perceptual signature, but the shift is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose flows with varied sentence length and strong forward motion; no scaffold loops or synonym churn stall the read. Occasional softeners (“seemed,” “showed signs of”) slightly dampen urgency, but they vanish before the climax. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and the seed-pod bell image is precise. A single paraphrase loop (“strangers into family” / “strangers became family”) costs a hairline -0.2, preventing the 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The altruistic-ghost-orchard premise is familiar, yet the symbiotic butterfly-larvae watering bell feels fresh and non-obvious, integrating ecology with afterlife. Chalked dawn messages invert the usual séance trope into quiet agricultural mystery, a pleasing inversion. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but specificity of Veridia’s pollination crisis lifts the tale above generic pastoral fantasy. Derivative echoes (floating islands, violet skies) are offset by the bell’s biological twist, earning a solid mid-high originality score.</comment>
