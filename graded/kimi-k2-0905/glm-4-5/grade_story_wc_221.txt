<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—she “closed her eyes briefly” to trigger the glimpse, a bodily cue that externalizes her gift. The contradiction between isolation and sacred duty is vivid, but the arc is primarily declarative (“now she understood”) rather than shown through a late micro-choice that forecloses a path. No embodied cost (tremor, hesitation) is granted to the final beat; the insight arrives as label. Still, her perceptual signature is sustained and individuated, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the compass warms, the final sentence crystallizes “true north within her” with conceptual cost—she will remain alone. Accumulative lens holds: each star-map ritual thickens the pattern until the last reprise reweights her pariah status as chosen vocation. Causality is lyric rather than plot-based, acceptable under Accumulative default. The cost is felt, not paid, hence lands safely under RR.</comment>

<comment>The observation deck is sketched via functional micro-detail—“dim light,” “dormant equipment longing”—that mirrors her exile. The compass rose is handled twice (warmth at end), charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Sensory economy favors the visual, but the narrowed spectrum fits the solitary, star-lit scene.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve cosmic knowledge for an unknowable future—is declared early. Escalation is accretive: each mapped star tightens the burden of being the sole witness. No external reversal, but the pattern deepens until the final sketch becomes irrevocable commitment. Cost is conceptual (eternal solitude) rather than tactile, clear under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposition of temporal stretch and human continuity: starlight centuries old versus tonight’s ritual. The compass rose reprises as both navigational tool and self-orientation, reconfiguring “true north” from sky to interior. No final-paragraph sermon; the last image lets warmth stand for earned insight. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone follow?—inviting reflection without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “starlight that had traveled millennia reached her in what felt like seconds.” Rhythm swells and contracts to mimic time dilation, a patterned compression taught by line 3 and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; diction remains within her scholarly register. The near-repetitive anaphora (“She was…”) is intentional, mirroring incantatory ritual.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory, and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“ghosts of past discoveries”—and avoids purple inflation. Closure line is clean, no artifact; readability under compression is exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “blessed pariah astronomer mapping time-dilated stars” is a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and cosmic-awe tropes. The innovation lies in making cartography of hope the active stakes, not mere survival. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into repetition, but cadence control keeps it coherent. Not quite 9+ because the emotional calculus is solitary—no secondary voice complicates the premise.</comment>
