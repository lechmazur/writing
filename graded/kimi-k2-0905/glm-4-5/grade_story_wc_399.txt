<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and sustained, but the walker’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the cost of isolation is asserted, not embodied in a micro-choice. The final “renewed purpose” is a summary uplift rather than a visible renunciation with price. Still, the voice-specific perception and ritual micro-gestures keep the portrait above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the consecrated clearing holds, the echo is “stored,” and the walker departs with renewed purpose—an imagistic RR with conceptual cost. Causality, however, is loose; the kinetic parapet responds because “it always had,” not because the ritual beats pressure-tested an earlier choice. Orientation anchor (who/where) is delayed past 120 words, but the lyric disorientation later pays off in the final image, so the penalty is waived. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet escalation is one-note—density thickens but never tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Selective, breath-level sensory detail (“obsidian concealment,” “sand…held memories”) keeps the desert and temple tactile without cataloguing. The kinetic parapet is evoked more as mythic engine than machined object, yet its rumble beneath the walker’s soles in the final beat lets the setting constrain stance. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Micro-setting (half-mask, mosaic floor) functions as tool and threshold, charging the final image enough to brush the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is declared early and held. Pressure intensifies only texturally: murmurs deepen, sand remembers, parapet hums, but no live option is foreclosed; the ritual’s risk is never contradicted or tested. Consequently the “cost” is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but not the tightening required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: preservation as solitary, perpetual labor. The image of truth growing “wild like flowers in an otherwise barren landscape” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—mask off/mask on—as acceptance of perpetual isolation. Avoids explicit thesis, lets complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a controlled, incantatory rhythm that mirrors ritual pace. Diction stays within the walker’s mystical register (“conjured clearings,” “ley lines”) without purple inflation. Perceptual signature is distinct: attention to peripheral edges, sand-memory, stone-whisper. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; voice coherence under pressure is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate: parallelism and anaphora (“After the prophet…”) teach the liturgical cadence, then pay off in the hush of the final line. A few soft repetitions (“the line walker…”) approach template cadence but stay purposive. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each sentence layers task, world, and cost—keeps momentum through 755 words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mythic desert-engine trope is refreshed through tactile peripheral mechanics rather than exposition. The “whisperfield calm” coinage feels native to this world. Risk is taken with near-static ritual scene, but the accumulative texture justifies the quiet. Not radically new, yet the synthesis of sand-memories, kinetic architecture, and masked custodian is memorable and specific.</comment>
