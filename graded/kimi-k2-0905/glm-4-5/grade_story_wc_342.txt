<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The interior contradiction of a face-blind portraitist is crisp from the first line, and every beat (tracing grain, kneeling to pry the board, pressing coin into clay) is filtered through her perceptual bias. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values: sky-mapping vs. salvaging human essence. The final renunciation—accepting the building’s fall while pocketing the coin—carries visible cost and is earned by her prior pattern-seeking. Only the “algorithmic key” moment flirts with diagnostic label-speak, not quite embodied enough for the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the walls now “shimmer with a network of interlocking patterns” that reconfigure portraiture itself, and the cost is legible—she forfeits the literal sky to keep the invisible one. Causal lens dominates (each beat because/therefore: blindness → pattern obsession → coin discovery → new method). Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Only a micro-slip: the coin’s “algorithmic key” function is revealed rather than tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is not backdrop but tool: its spiraling grain guides Elara’s fingers to the loose board, its carved leaf-holes become the very projector screen for her sky-map. Micro-setting (coin, clay, plaster) constrains the final craft action. Sensory economy is biased to touch and shadow, matching her non-visual gift. The “heightened stillness” is sustained through selective auditory absence until the first mechanical growl, a cadence shift that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she archive human essence before demolition—tightens when the coin offers a new method that replaces literal star-mapping. One meaningful turn: sky-projections abandoned for soul-patterns; options narrow to either release the building or imprison its memory in her new syntax. Cost is visible: she forfeits the original sky-mirror plan and accepts imminent loss. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the invisible bonds between people can be archived only when facial appearance is discarded. Subtext lives in gesture (tracing woodgrain, pressing coin into clay) rather than assertion. The final image reweights the premise—portraiture without faces—without moralizing. No symbolic convenience: the coin’s pattern is earned by her lifelong compensation for prosopagnosia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s tactile, pattern-hungry perception; no filter-verb stacks. Syntax mirrors her fractal mind: long, winding sentences for spiral grain; clipped fragments during discovery. Diction stays within her artisan lexicon (“fractally precise,” “plaster impressions”). No head-hopping, no register drift; the single micro over-explanation (“algorithmic key”) is the only hairline slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature—looped cadence while she maps, staccato beats at coin discovery. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, interior calculus, and plot advancement. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (moon as witness, constellations on floor) stay consistent. Only minor scaffolding: “heightened stillness” is repeated once more than necessary, not quite dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portraitist archiving souls via star-pattern coin is a fresh synthesis; no close genre echoes. Risk—the entire story is a quiet craft sequence inside a condemned tree—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds: the coin’s soul-mapping method is followed to its last implication. Specificity (spiraling grain, leaf-cut moonlight) makes the premise unforgettable.</comment>
