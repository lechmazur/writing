<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amelia’s interior contradiction—artist who has lost her own color yet can still conjure it for others—is dramatized in micro-choices: she caresses the gray shard, risks her reputation on the observatory show, and watches strangers cry while her own joy “surfaces.” The cost is visible when the council sneers and when she stays up all night, paint-stained, trading sleep for revelation. Flaw: the “lost joy” is named more than embodied in body-level ache; still, the final smile is earned because every previous refusal to quit is on-page. One hairline slip from occasional therapeutic self-label (“rediscover lost joy”) keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fog still cloaks the streets, but the festival is reborn inside the observatory whose copper roof now leaks colored light. Causal chain never breaks—fragment under lamp → dancers appear → crowd weeps → Amelia’s joy rekindled → tradition restarts. Cost is legible in her sleepless night and in the council’s skeptical grant; persistent constraint is the ever-present fog that makes the indoor colors necessary. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each luminous layer thickens meaning until the final projection reweights the entire district.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory’s dome, the fragment’s grit under fingertips, and the fog that “swallowed” sound all constrain action: only a sealed dark space can make the colors visible. Sensory hierarchy obeys Amelia’s painter priorities—she notices wavelength before temperature, stone texture before smell. Spatial choreography is pristine: studio lamps click, cables trip visitors, children lean so close their breath fogs the glass. Micro-setting of the shard itself functions as pivot-object, charging the final image when its dancers bloom across the curved wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can joy be exhumed from ruin?”—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the gray shard first seems dead, then reveals dancers, then demands a public display that could fail. Escalation is textural: each new wavelength adds historical and emotional density until the festival is reborn. Price is visible fatigue and the council’s mockery; no option is foreclosed, but the community’s emotional stake is irreversibly enlarged. Agency sits with Amelia at every lamp adjustment; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art is a solvent that dissolves temporal fog. Subtext lives in gesture—old woman’s fingers tracing air-dancers signify memory re-embodied. The final image reweights “ruin” from decay to fertile seed. No moralizing sentence appears; the only articulated thesis is childlike (“Perhaps all ruins are just stories…”), voiced by a child, hence diegetically safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person focalization clings to Amelia’s visual cortex: “impossible colors,” “liquid dawn,” “dew-heavy orchards” are painterly synaesthesias. Rhythm accelerates with lamp clicks and shortened sentences at climax. No head-hop; council voices stay external, heard through her anxiety. Occasional lyric lift (“pensive mirth”) is earned because it first appears as her private phrase and is later echoed by collective awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long breathy cadences (fog description) to staccato lamp adjustments; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor is visual and necessary (“colors…like liquid dawn” justifies her profession). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence adds either historical or emotional information. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; final line resolves by image that re-illuminates earlier motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresco-as-unexposed-film is a fresh conceptual splice; light-painting resurrects it without digital fakery, keeping magic grounded. Orchard district swallowed by centuries of fog is familiar topoi made specific through Amelia’s lamp-by-lamp revelation. Risk of sentimentality is embraced and survived by letting the crowd—not the narrator—weep first. The synthesis feels inevitable: of course a color-starved painter would mine gray stone for hidden spectra.</comment>
