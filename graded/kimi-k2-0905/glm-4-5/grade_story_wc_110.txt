<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motives—curiosity, then custodial honesty—are legible, but her interiority stays generic (“heart raced,” “realized now”). The renunciation beat (leaving the lens) is因果ally earned yet emotionally skimmed; we get abstract virtue, not the felt cost of surrendering god-sight. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; she glides from discovery to ethical choice without friction or body-level fallout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: lens relinquished, silence re-seen as communal intimacy—an earned stasis with conceptual cost (she will keep scrubbing toilets while knowing everyone’s secrets). Causal chain is sound: lens → visions → temptation → refusal → new communicative praxis. Orientation and stakes are late—first 120 words dwell on atmospherics—but the payoff justifies the initial hush, so waiver applies. Lens ambiguity at midpoint is nil; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt after rain is evoked through echoing steps, moonlit glass, soft droplet melody—selective, POV-filtered, and thematically resonant. Micro-setting (the hidden chamber of lenses) functions as both plot pivot and symbolic repricing of “seeing.” Spatial choreography stays crisp; no floating rooms. Weather affects footing and mood, never over-described. Meets 9+ gate: the recurring “crystal whispering” recharges the final communal silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she weaponize or share the truth?—is signaled once she sees living doodles. Escalation is gentle: each ticket thickens temptation, but no tangible price is exacted (no nosebleed, no civic panic). The map-ticket discovery is pure convenience, not agency. Final renunciation narrows options, yet the on-page cost is only abstract (“she might finally bridge those gaps”)—felt pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—honesty as communal antidote to wordless silence—emerges through gesture (cryptic doodle notes) rather than sermon. Subtext is strongest in the paradox of “ambiguous clarity”: truth that is both obscure and piercing. Final image of “comfortable silence between people who truly understood” reweights earlier dread into shared poise. Avoids overt thesis, though “freed by honesty” prompt-echo is a hairline thematic bruise (-0.3).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s noticing bias (echoing steps, warmth of lens). Diction leans poetic but stays consistent: hush, resonate, crystalline—never jarring register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for awe, clipped fragments for discovery (“She understood now.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature could be sharper—metaphors verge on template (“world transformed”)—but remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph lengths breathe. Some modifier stacks (“lingering notes of music and scattered concert tickets, some bearing cryptic doodles”) dilute impact. No scaffold loops, but “crystal whispering forecourt” recurs enough to feel incantatory rather than urgent. Mixed-metaphor risk in “ambiguously clear” is acknowledged and thematic, not accidental. Generally clean; density slips in descriptive lulls rather than high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Post-verbal society + visual truth-lens is a fresh synthesis; doodle-tickets as living diary pages feels newly minted. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than shock-twist—but coherent. Specificity of “crystal whispering forecourt” keeps the concept from sliding into generic dystopia. Could swap names/places, yet the mechanism of silent transparency via discarded ephemera is memorable. Not groundbreaking, but avoids stock templates.</comment>
