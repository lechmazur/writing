<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The keeper’s detachment and embodied rituals (etching stone, folding paper) are vivid; the loose grip on reality enables the burrow and the refusal to surrender to stasis, a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—the interiority is steady observation—so the 9+ “contradictory impulses in scene” test fails by a hair. Still, the enduring witness ethos and final return to river noise show a scaled, individual arc that forecloses the tempting silence. Characterization is specific, non-diagnostic, and tightly wedded to theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of river time vs. frozen silence tightens through sensory callbacks (water roar vs. ozone hush) and closes with a resonant reconfiguration—the keeper re-enters flow bearing the silence’s imprint. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 20; no orientation debt. Closure cost is legible: the keeper foregoes eternal preservation, choosing ongoing decay; the swan’s new trace is the visible price. No causal gaps; the origami method is set up, paid off, and constrains return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and paper-swan “micro-setting” constrain every move: the refuge’s acoustics frame witness stance, the swan’s folds gate the burrow and return. Library catacombs evolve from atmospheric backdrop to active void that halts decay; the ozone scent and unblemished manuscript are tactile consequences of the silence rule. Spatial choreography is exact—no drift in body or object positions. Details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final image (river roar vs. silence imprint), meeting the 9+ “environment charges final image” test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness vs. stasis—is signaled early and tightens once: the regenerative silence offers eternal preservation, foreclosed by the keeper’s choice to exit and resume decay. Cost is on-page: the swan bears new tracings; the keeper re-absorbs river noise, relinquishing timeless safety. Agency is interior (renunciation) but visible and irreversible. No secondary antagonist needed; pressure is situational and conceptual. Meets 8.8+ “visible price” threshold; lacks second tightening beat for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entropy vs. witness emerges through concrete pattern: river’s endless change against silence’s perfect stasis. Final return reweights earlier motifs—etched stone now holds silence’s secret; water sound becomes the price of refusal. No moralizing; meaning is image-bound. The emergent aftereffect is a hush inside the reader, mirroring the keeper’s earned detachment. Complexity is embraced: decay is neither evil nor redeemable, only observed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person voice maintains lyric distance that mirrors the keeper’s detachment; diction is archaic-leaning (“etched,” “untold seasons”) yet precise, never generic. Rhythm slows during burrow (long sibilants) and quickens with river return—purposeful cadence shift. No dialogue to distort. Perceptual signature is biased toward texture and sound over plot, coherent with witness motivation. Elision of travel mechanics is taught early and paid off at return, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—each sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or emotional work. Metaphors are coherent (ink on wet parchment, solidified honey) and never mixed. Opening and final lines are sharp bookends. No filter-verb clusters or register drift. One hairline slip: “smooth, dark walls absorbing” repeats the absorptive motif in adjacent phrases; minor, does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise is familiar (hidden library, magic paper) yet made fresh through the inverse anomaly—silence that preserves—and the witness ethos that refuses it. Origami-as-geometry-key is specific, not gimmick, and links to theme of folded time. Risk: quiet, anti-heroic arc could read as static, but the refusal beat provides sufficient hinge. Does not reach 9.0 because the silence rule, while elegant, is introduced rather than foreshadowed, slightly lowering inevitability.</comment>
