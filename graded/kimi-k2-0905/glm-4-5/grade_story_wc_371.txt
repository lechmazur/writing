<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eliza’s interior contradiction—guilt for past silence vs. present need to protect—drives every beat; the bread-as-forgiveness object reweights her stance with visible cost when she leaves the last pieces behind. Micro-choices (pouring tea, reading aloud) keep pressure alive. Her flaw (hesitation) compounds earlier, then is accepted in the final renunciation, earning stasis. No secondary character on-page, so status and relationship tests are waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bread’s meaning flips from relic to shared absolution, felt cost in the act of leaving it. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of vanished objects and garden plantings reweights the stake of “noticing” until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (palace gates, rain, tea house). No prop teleport or causality break; the bakery’s disappearance is the given constraint, not a late rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Secret tea house and guerrilla garden function as micro-setting: mint through flagstones constrains foot placement, wisteria curtain hides the entrance, altering Eliza’s stealth tactics. Sensory selection skews olfactory (yeast, sage, rain on tin) matching her “noticer” bias. Weather (autumn storm) is not backdrop—rain determines when she reads the letter and charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds: bread wrapper, kettle, letter are tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the ordinary”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the letter redefines the bakery’s vanishing from tragic to protective, forcing Eliza to absorb that “ordinary” bread now means forgiveness. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope; cost is the forfeiture of the last loaf, legible on page. No external antagonist; conflict is internal/accumulative, coherent under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (rain starts at read-aloud) complicates mood, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulating objects (bread, garden, letters) rather than statement; final image of abandoned bread reweights “sacred in ordinary” without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph. Subtext lives in gesture: tearing loaf = self-absolution. Complexity retained—vanishing bakers are both careless and heroic. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone else find the bread? Insight earned via concrete struggle, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eliza; perceptual signature—“creeping normality noticer”—colors every clause (“mint pushing through cracked flagstones” not just visual, but evidence of slow change). No head-hop. Syntax mirrors patient attention: long sentences for observation, fragments under pressure (“time to reveal”). No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: descriptive lulls accelerate at letter reveal. No template cadence or synonym loops; “bread” reprises with shifted meaning, not repetition for filler. Mixed metaphors absent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image (“remaining pieces…for whoever might need”) recharges motif. Filter verbs minimal and motivated (“she considered”). High information density: single sentences deliver setting, memory, and moral weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “guerrilla garden as spiritual resistance” plus “vanished bakery as loving concealment” twists familiar dystopia tropes into quiet lyric. Risk taken with low-action accumulative structure pays off in final reconfiguration. Specificity of “Sweet Morning” bread wrapper and palace tea house prevents generic anywhere-ness. Transformation test passes: story collapses without Eliza’s particular guilt and noticing. No derivative premise penalty; concept is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
