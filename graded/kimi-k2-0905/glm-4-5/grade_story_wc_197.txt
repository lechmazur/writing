<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quiet-archivist cover and phone-booth-key obsession give her a crisp, specific edge; her micro-choice to trust the puddle-map shows trait-consistent risk-taking. Interiority leans on stock rebel shorthand (“tyranny of indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction, so the deeper emotional cost feels announced, not dramatized. Theodor is sketched only as trembling exposition, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is missing. Still, her final grin of grim continuation earns a credible endurance stance that forecloses rest, satisfying the closure-cost test.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: informant warning → patrol increase → puddle epiphany → lagoon breach → key bypass → data drain, each linkage legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ripples become a portable archive, reconfiguring future options with the conceptual cost of permanent exile. Orientation is clean by line 5; no penalty. The “ voices вони laughedнебр” typo fractures causality mid-climax, breaking immediacy and capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Auric lagoon under starlight is vividly anchored and repeatedly filters choices: golden surface hides vaults, reflection delivers map, shimmer hosts projection. The TrueComm key’s tarnish and slot placement satisfy micro-setting object constraint. Sensory economy is strong—bruised sky, liquid gold—without checklist excess. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across marsh approach and shoreline pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“save histories before dawn purge”—is signaled early and tightened when patrols triple, forcing the puddle map gambit. Mara’s agency drives every escalation: she deciphers, plugs cables, initiates transfer while sirens approach. Cost is visible—alarm flash, permanent flight—but price feels collective rather than personally visceral; hence high-band entry but not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. engineered forgetting emerges through the lagoon’s golden veil and the key’s obsolete logo, never sermonized. Subtext operates in gesture—Theodor’s trembling hand, Mara’s pocket pat—rather than thesis lines. Final image of rippling archives reweights the premise: history now swims with the fugitives, a resonant non-moral answer. One decorative “coded freedom” phrase near end nicks the score but doesn’t capsise resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is serviceably lean, though metaphors (“bruised purples,” “liquid gold”) recycle familiar palette. Dialogue is sparse but natural—Old Theodor’s “I didn’t expect you to make it this far” carries subtext of guilt and admiration. Filter-verb tally is low; rhythm breathes with the stealth tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Line momentum is strong: most sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere without scaffold. Minor loop—“lagoon” repeated three times in five lines—dulls without pattern payoff. One garbled Cyrillic fragment mid-climax is an outright typo, not stylized voice, jarring clarity. Otherwise concision and varied sentence openings keep propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Turning a puddle reflection into an insurgent map feels fresh and specific; the obsolete phone-booth key as skeleton key to state archives is a lovely, irreplaceable irony. Accumulation of forgotten tech (TrueComm logo, guardian podium) synthesizes vintage and dystopian without checklist tokenism. Conceptual risk—history as portable starlit projection—pays off by reweighting escape into perpetual dissemination. Score edges into high band because the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
