<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and risk-taking are vivid, but interior contradiction is stated rather than dramatized (“she needed to find…” vs. no visible competing impulse). No embodied emotion under pressure—static screen-tracing replaces body reaction. The lie is confessed, not lived; we never feel her pulse spike or palms sweat. Career-suicide stakes are declared, not tasted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: patch → numbers → breach → download → flight. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (she is now hunted). Orientation is late—archive geography only crystallizes at ~180 words, but the delay ultimately feeds the “digital necropolis” image, so waiver applies. One minor teleport: alarms “scream behind her” after she is already gone, softening cause/effect immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Archive as labyrinthine dataspace is economically evoked through access-denied grays and static-charged screen. The Stellaris patch reappears with reweighted meaning, satisfying micro-setting gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; a haptic jolt (keyboard heat, server hum) is missed. Spatial choreography inside restricted sector remains legible—no floating corps of data.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover vanishing truth—signals early and escalates via each 731 recurrence. The ninety-second breach window supplies visible ticking clock, narrowing options. Cost is declared (career/freedom) but not dramatized on-page; we do not see the first security ping or credential audit. Escalation leans informational rather than visceral, keeping it below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of erasure vs. persistence emerges through deleted-file whispers and the final vow to keep truth alive, avoiding explicit thesis. The forgotten-song motif glints twice but never accrues new resonance, so subtext stalls short of sublime. No moralizing paragraph—credit earned. Conceptual repricing lands: the archive itself becomes a living witness, reweighting digital ghosts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric style sustains electric diction—“static electricity of forbidden knowledge,” “digital necropolis.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, staccato for breach. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature sharp (“she traced … with her finger”). Corporate argon is kept in-character. No dialogue to test naturalism; internal voice stays consistent, never committee-flat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence variety and propulsion strong; opening line anchors. Figurative layering is dense—three metaphors in two sentences (“constellations,” “digital necropolis,” “ghosts in the machine”)—but pattern is taught early and echoed at closure, so allowed. One template cadence hiccup: “something that… something that… something that…” in video fragment, dulling peak beat. No paraphrase loops or typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of cold-case procedural with ghost-archive is fresh; Stellaris patch twist punches holes in official history without feeling gimmickled. 731 as numeric haunt is specific, not generic conspiracy code. Risk of overwriting accepted because metaphoric weave pays off in final image. Could swap names/places, but the archive-as-afterlife conceit is irreplaceable, giving it a memorable tilt.</comment>
