<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and salt-stained vocation are vivid, embodied, and drive every beat. The contradiction between her agoraphobia-like dread and her calling to descend into stone arteries is kept alive in sinew, not summary. Micro-choices—squaring shoulders, steadying breath—reveal a hierarchy of values. The ending’s Earned Stasis (she will return, cost accepted) is fully rooted in these traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: tide window → descent → Codex ignition → guided transitions → exit before reclaim. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 120 words and are echoed in the 42-minute clock. Closure—the quiet renunciation of self to perpetual duty—carries felt cost in the final image of her heart knowing only “sacred silence between.” No lens ambiguity; Accumulatively textured pressure tightens to Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Facility, cylinder, Codex, and salt-rot concrete are not backdrop but equipment: the cylinder is the portal, the Codex the key, the narrowing stairwell presses against her phobia. Gold flecks respond to cable EM fields, marrying tech to occult. Sensory hierarchy—damp air licking skin, humming pipes inside bones—filters through her spelunker senses. Setting constrains the final image: only this cliff, this tide, this door licenses her ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding the unremembered before ocean reclaims access—tightens at the ticking 42-minute clock. Each shadow she ushers through the cylinder forecloses personal escape; the last departing glimmer costs her the possibility of joining them tonight. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through dwindling time and accumulating shadows. Cost is visible: she emerges salt-crusted, alone, committed to eternal return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as electric current, grief as conduction—emerges from cable/ghost/Codex circuitry rather than exposition. Subtext resides in the crashing hush: worlds nearly collide yet never touch, a metaphor for bereavement’s permanent gap. Final image reweights the premise: silence is not absence but the charged space where meaning arcs. No moralizing; the reconfiguration is felt in body and tide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s sinew and seabeat rhythm. Diction—“salt-stained concrete yawned,” “crashing hush”—is compressed, lyrical, and POV-bound. No filter-verb stacks; perception degrades under pressure (“breathing quickened,” “walls seemed to press closer”). Voice scales with stress, ending in stripped cadence that mirrors the hush she now carries.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are lean, varied, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“tired giant,” “fibrous veins”) and paid off in final “sacred silence between.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor tone and reweight image—while paragraph cuts tighten to single-sentence beats at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusing claustrophobia, undersea telecom infrastructure, and medieval Codex into a grief-ritual is non-obvious and specific. The premise commits fully—no late rule changes—and follows electromagnetic/tidal logic to its eerie conclusion. Risky compression of occult tech is justified by sensory specificity and earned cost. If names were swapped, the ritual would collapse; freshness is baked into the parts.</comment>
