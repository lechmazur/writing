<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tracing the wrapping paper, the seed’s scent pulsing in her sinuses—and her goal intensifies cleanly from curiosity to guardianship. The final renunciation (she accepts village anchor, abandons wandering ambition) is legible, but the cost is stated rather than dramatized; we are told “she finally felt the peace” instead of seeing a micro-choice that forfeits an alternate life. Interior contradiction is present but soft: her fear of the elders’ judgment is named once and never retested. Still, the sensory-embodied motive and earned station lift the score into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-build via scent, doodles, and generational paper until a cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of village lights crystallizes her new role and forecloses the wanderer path. Cost is conceptual—she becomes rooted—made legible in “the anchor point for a destiny she now embraced.” Orientation is clean; transitions are single elastic climb within one scene. One causal seam is thin: the elders’ “quiet approval” floats in without prior pressure, but it does not resolve the conflict, only observes, so lens integrity holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The treetop canopy is rendered through tacticle rope bridges, swirling mists, and seed-filament bioluminescence—details that constrain movement and later charge the final image. Micro-setting objects (wrapping paper, seed, pouch) are handled repeatedly and evolve: paper from archive to language, seed from morbid specimen to guardian. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s nose: every beat is filtered through scent. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the vertical climb. One slip: “the turning of the tide’s thought” is repeated without concrete environmental tether, keeping it just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the seed before it vanishes—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each scent layer and doodle swirl thickens the mystery until the blue filament reveal reweights the stake from “specimen” to “living library.” The protagonist’s agency is observational rather than tactical; she watches the seed open rather than forcing it, so pressure feels accumulative, not acute. Cost is conceptual (she accepts rootedness), visible in the final image, but no tangible resource is lost or risked, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge disguises itself in rot; what seems repellent protects. No explicit thesis is declared; the seed’s true nature reprises the grandmothers’ doodles, letting the idea resonate through pattern rather than assertion. The final paragraph risks thematic echo—”the undercurrent of wisdom that flows through all things”—but it is framed as Elara’s explanation to visitors, so it reads as character speech, not authorial sermon. Ambiguity lingers: the village will thrive, but Elara’s personal sacrifices remain unnamed, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s olfactory perceptions; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical but anchored in vegetal specifics—“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush,” “spirals, dots, and patterns.” Rhythm modulates: longer inhalant sentences during scent discovery, shorter breath-points at filament reveal. One filter-verb cluster (“she noticed how her movements became more fluid”) is minor. Voice coherence is high; perceptual signature is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet efficient: “rope bridges of the mysterious treetop village with practiced ease” compresses setting, body, and habit in one stroke. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“village lights twinkled like stars brought to earth”) it recharges the closure image rather than stalls momentum. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-repeat: “the turning of the tide’s thought” appears twice without fresh inflection, a micro-drag that keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The corpse-flower-as-guardian inversion is fresh, and the ancestral doodle-archive mechanic feels specific to this world. Risk is taken in making scent the primary sense and climax observational rather than action-driven; the gamble pays off because the lyric pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Transformation test fails if seed is swapped out—entire plot collapses. Synthesis of herbalist lineage, olfactory POV, and wrapping-paper palimpsest yields a singular vision.</comment>
