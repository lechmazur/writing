<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet endurance and refusal to claim credit ring true; his interiority stays concrete (“understood the unspoken message”) and his micro-choice to expand the runs shows a visible cost in risking scarcity. The motivation to keep the community whole is steady, but the stakes jump is announced rather than embodied—no moment shows him doubting or calculating the real hunger price. Mira’s pressure line is the only beat that forces a tactical shift, so the characterization is strong yet not quite piercing the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Elias publicly redefines the mission, foreclosing anonymity and inviting greater danger while the bell toll charges the moment with ancestral cost. Causality under the Situational lens coheres—sanctions tighten ➔ scarcity looms ➔ expansion declared—each step legible as pressure crystallizing stance. The midpoint orientation is anchored by word 80 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”), so no orientation debt. The cost is felt, but the actual ration math and crossing risk are asserted, not witnessed; that keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta arbor re-appears as council site and launch point, its clay resonance carrying ancestral history; the silver bell micro-setting constrains timing and ritual, charging the final declaration. Sensory selection is urgent—night air “amplified quiet,” moonlit path—filtered through Elias’s tactical attention. Spatial choreography is clean: three figures emerge, packs leave, Mira returns; no floating bodies. The environment never forces a physical trade-off (no checkpoint encounter), so it stops shy of 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signalled early; the tightening arrives when Mira reports new restrictions, narrowing future options. Escalation is situational: external pressure crystallizes Elias’s public stance, visible cost is the foreclosed anonymity and the implied danger of wider runs. Agency is present—he chooses to expand—but the beat is still declarative; we do not see him weigh hunger against capture odds. Sufficient for the length, but the price is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mutual aid as resistance to exile and embargo, shown through rice bundles and bell lineage rather than thesis. The final image—bell ringing over widening mission—offers a resonant reconfiguration: anonymity sacrificed for regional solidarity. Subtext lives in silence: Tomas’s question and Elias’s evasive answer let the reader feel how collective identity subsumes ego. No moral is stated; the cost is the exposure they have avoided for three winters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias; perceptual signature is steady—“amplified quiet,” “clear but muted sound.” Diction is controlled, no filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped commands. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct: Mira’s whispered intel versus Elias’s parable-like reply to Tomas. No head-hop or register drift; voice does not scale the hairline mastery needed for 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or synonym churn; sentences open varied, information dense—“Each bundle contained just enough for a family to share” does world, stakes, and history in one line. Figurative language is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “they’ve tightened restrictions… They will need more support” restates scarcity twice—acceptable at 700 words but keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—refugee mutual aid—gains freshness via the anonymous elder + antique bell reversal: heritage weaponized for secrecy, then surrendered to expansion. Specific detail (terra-cotta arbor, seventh-year sanctions) roots the tale. The midnight-run logistics and grandmother-backstory avoid generic everyman. Risk is moderate; no structural experiment, but the bell-as-signal and anonymity twist feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
