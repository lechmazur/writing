<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s disenchantment is shown through concrete withdrawal—dismissing guards, choosing climbing leathers—and the interior contradiction between crown-duty and dream-urgency is felt in her muscles on the rock. The reflection-swap in the pool dramatizes her buried self, giving the renunciation of the “gilded cage” a visible cost. Maera functions mainly as mythic facilitator, so status crucible is off-stage, and the final ascent does not test new flaws; still, the earned return to court with secret strength lands cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dream recurrence → firefly ritual → cobalt threshold → starlight pool tightens the stake each beat; each image accretes meaning until the reflection re-prices her identity. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 50 words). Closure is CR: the bleeding starlight reweights her royal role with undeniable conceptual cost—she returns transformed, carrying a hidden wellspring. Persistent constraint: the grotto remains her clandestine recharge, shaping future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Micro-settings—razor-sharp holds, liquid-sapphire pool—constrain the climb and the vision; the cobalt grotto’s glow guides each hand placement and the final reflection. Fireflies echo as charged object, bridging childhood memory to grotto radiance. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: touch and sight dominate ascent; at climax, mirrored light reconfigures identity. Setting charges the final image: sunrise ignites embers at the entrance, sealing the secret.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: reclaim authentic self beneath crown. Escalation is textural: dream density → cliff danger → starlight revelation; each tightens the internal vice. The pool vision forces irreversible self-recognition, foreclosing pure monarchic facade. Cost is legible—she descends physically battered and publicly unchanged yet privately transformed, a palpable forfeiture of innocence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—authenticity versus obligation—emerges through mirrored starlight, not stated. Subtext operates in gesture: the annual exhale with Maera signals unbroken continuity beneath royal performance. Final image of the queen smiling at counselors reweights earlier “final warning” without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: she retains throne yet harbors secret, embracing dual identity cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient maintains consistent distance, filtering perceptions through Elara’s tired determination and wonder. Syntax modulates: short clauses during climb mimic breathless effort; languid cadence in grotto reflects starlight awe. Diction stays within plausible royal-educated lexicon—“lacy menace,” “luminescent tears”—without overreach. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer action, sensory detail, and meaning—e.g., “bleeding starlight… luminescent tears into liquid sapphire” does triple duty. Rhythm breathes with ascent exertion versus cavern hush. Minor scaffold: “they shared an exhale spotting…” could trim spotting; “gilded cage” cliché. No loops in final third; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines familiar royal escape + visionary cave, but specificity of firefly ritual and bleeding starlight pool refreshes trope. Transformation hinge—mirror showing younger self—feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk taken in quiet ending: no renunciation of crown, only secret integration. Slight deduction for “gilded cage” idiom and archetypal wise nursemaid.</comment>
