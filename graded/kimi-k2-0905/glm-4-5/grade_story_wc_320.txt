<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s want-to-find-beginnings motive is stated repeatedly, but only the final silent tuning beat dramatizes a costly micro-choice. Interiority drifts into thematic self-explanation (“she knew she must succeed by discarding assumptions”) that reads therapeutic rather than embodied. A single, earned renunciation (letting the towers sleep) lands, but earlier beats stay ornamental, not crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure cleanly satisfies Conceptual Repricing: the towers’ hum reweights the city as a living relic, cost is visible in Elara’s solitary descent. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mounting silence → resonance → quiet again—held without contradiction. Orientation anchors arrive by word 60; no penalty. Escalation is modest (one tightening), but sufficient for sub-800 word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted antennas, humming fragment, and wind-whipped gorge create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her balancing stance atop the tower; every sensory pick is filtered through her signal-hunter bias. Spatial choreography stays clean across her climb-place-tune sequence. The “blue-white field” at closure re-uses the sky/steel palette, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the lunar signal or fail—announced early; stakes tighten once when ambient sound drops to zero after shard placement, forcing her to listen inward. No visible price other than transient bodily risk; cost remains conceptual (knowledge gained, towers re-awakened then re-abandoned). Sufficient for lyrical mode, but lacks a concrete forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges from the towers’ re-activation and the fragment’s journey: death-to-earth-to-signal. No overt moralizing; final image of “peaceful slumber” re-prices the city as archive rather than ruin. Subtext rests in silence and steel vibration, not exposition. One thematic echo (“find the beginning in every ending”) is repeated but not terminal, so −0.3 only; still resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”—creating a consistent diction of calibrated mysticism. Rhythm swells and narrows with physical altitude: long clauses up the tower, clipped fragments at tuning peak. No dialogue, so no voice-contamination risk. Meets 9+ quick test: rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Sparse scaffold—only two near-paraphrase clusters (“abandoned city suspended over the gorge” echoed). Figurative language disciplined: “serenely electric” is motif, not purple. One filter-verb stack in the third beat “began to glow brighter” but does not clog climax; stays below 9-floor but prose is publishable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fallen actress-star-as-fragment + radio-tower-listening + lunar-perigee tuning fuses glam, tech, and cosmic myth without checklist feel. Conceptual risk in “shard of hush” pays off by literalizing silence as tool. Not a transparent allegory; particulars would collapse if swapped. Within-band +0.3 for risk that sharpens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
