<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mage’s “lukewarm” label is repeated but never dramatized as a specific limitation that complicates the bell-mending; interiority drifts into abstract self-talk (“magic was never my strong suit”) instead of embodying contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice shows him risking failure because of tepid power; the rebuild succeeds on first attempt, so the promised flaw never shapes tactics or exacts cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands: the bell’s “lukewarm” toll audibly rebalances the sea, a clean Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (silence → life). Causality is loose, however—dripping-rate lore is declared rather than tested—and the Orientation Test triggers: who/where/when is clear by word 40, but the cosmic imbalance rule is introduced after midpoint with no prior cue, so a −0.3 applies, capping Q2 at 7.2 and Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sapphire viaduct and dawn light are vividly, selectively rendered; the meteor-bronze bell and dripping water serve as micro-setting that constrains the mage’s ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean, but the cosmic-scale oceanic rules are announced late and never integrated into the physical environment, so the setting cannot charge the final image at 9-level.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore sea-life—signals early, and the silence → fish beat offers a visible tightening. Yet the mage faces no live opposition, resource drain, or failed attempt; escalation is declarative (“cosmic imbalance evident everywhere”) rather than enacted through narrower options or rising price, so pressure stays moderate under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—“lukewarm can still mend the world”—emerges cleanly from the bell’s final tone and the sea’s revival, avoiding explicit moral. The brittle devotion motif is announced too often (“brittle devotion in the way people…”) but ultimately reweights in the closing image; subtext would deepen if the mage’s naivety visibly cost him something on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; diction leans poetic but remains within a mage’s lexicon. Rhythm varies, and the bell’s “silence that settled across the waters” is a sharp perceptual signature. Occasional template cadence (“The… The…” openers) and filter stacks (“he felt… he realized…”) dull immediacy in peak beats, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is vivid but dense; three metaphors in four sentences (“fallen giant,” “counting down,” “settling stars”) risk coherence drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet elevated register edges into purple during the climax. Information density is high; tightening two adjective strings would sharpen propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Re-casting a ship’s bell from meteor bronze via dripping-water numerology is a fresh mythic synthesis; the “lukewarm” mage as cosmic repairman subverts power-tier clichés. Specificity of the sapphire viaduct and the silence-before-sound bell twist keep it from feeling like a generic eco-fantasy template. Risk is moderate; a higher score would require an even less familiar causal ruleset or a steeper personal cost.</comment>
