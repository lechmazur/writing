<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Samuel’s interiority is evocative—moonlight healing, cataloging sorrow—but his contradictory impulse (pursue arboreal truth vs. maintain stone labyrinth) stays summary; no in-scene moment forces a painful trade-off. The epiphany is gifted by resonance, not an active choice that costs him a path, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sorrow reframed as resilience, cost felt in his “weariness he hadn’t acknowledged.” Accumulative lens holds—images (sextant, pin-chime, dream frequencies) layer until meaning tilts. However, the decisive resonance is externally triggered; Samuel’s agency is limited to aligning sights, narrowing the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stormlit tower, brass gears, and scarred oak plank are vividly filtered through Samuel’s practiced eye; the sextant’s “liquid mercury” swirl charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive within 120 words; micro-setting (floorboard-of-oak) literally directs the moonbeam that unlocks the vision, meeting the 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decipher sorrow to preserve the labyrinth—remains abstract; the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical. The pin-chime coincidence complicates perception but does not test Samuel with a forked path or visible loss; pressure intensifies mood, yet options never narrow under his control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: quantified sorrow re-seen as arboreal patience. Trees’ “slow endurance” reframes grief without moralizing, though the epiphany’s external delivery softens thematic bite. Final image of sanctuary carries quiet, non-literal resonance, satisfying complexity without tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Samuel’s technician-poet perception; diction (“stormlit,” “quantified sorrow”) is consistent, rhythm modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; voice sustains lyrical compression without opacity, and the sextant’s mercury swirl is rendered in his lexicon of light and gear-work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry high density: moonlight “knitted his skin faster than any medicine” does plot + image + consequence in one stroke. Occasional adjective clusters (“impossibly ancient even when the tower was built”) verge on decoration but do not stall momentum or tangle causality; no loops or mixed metaphors near the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing dendrological memory with astrolabe mysticism feels fresh; the sextant as silvan key is a surprising yet prepared synthesis. Concept commits fully—no retreat to boilerplate fantasy— and the mundane-miraculous tone sustains risk without losing clarity.</comment>
