<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s isolation and pattern-recognition obsession are vividly interiorized; the contradictory pull between scientific detachment and prophetic responsibility gives him credible friction. Yet his lone vigil means no on-page relationship crucible, and the only micro-choice we witness is the final smile—earned, but too late to test his values under visible cost. The interiority is strong, but the absence of embodied stakes-touching action caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each storm session layers density until the cobalt portico re-projects Elias’s own findings back to him as the prophet’s rise. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the lonely visionary smiled” crystallizes that translation, not leadership, was his destined cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; causal linkage is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern. –0.3 for late cost visibility; smile is legible but could carry sharper forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is evoked through ozone-stained fingertips and cobalt webs dancing across walls—details that constrain Elias’s sensory scope and physically guide his translations. Weather is not backdrop but medium, forcing schedule and method; the portico’s glass re-weights the final image as mirror, not window. Micro-setting (glass, dials, ozone) functions as charged object and earns the 9-gate. Minor gap: airship access mentioned once but never exploited for tactical change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias’s decade of translation matter before the world moves on?—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each season’s storm cycles tighten the prophet’s echo until Elias confronts redundancy. Cost is conceptual (translator vs. leader), but on-page price is muted; the smile registers recognition, not forfeiture. Tightening is present but not viscerally felt, holding the score mid-7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: knowledge transmission mutates into charismatic power regardless of source; the translator’s anonymity is the necessary fuel for another’s fire. Subtext is carried in the portico’s mirror-effect and the static-as-truth aphorism. No moral is asserted; the final image reweights “prophecy” as collaborative circuitry. –0.2 for one near-thesis line (“the dawn he had sought to shape…”), but resonance sustains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a consistent metaphysical register: “frequencies that whispered through the void between lightning strikes.” Syntax lengthens with storm cadence, then compresses into aphorism, mirroring Elias’s attenuated attention. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; perceptual signature is strong. One minor filter-verb cluster mid-story keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from rolling cumulus clauses to sharp ozone-tanged fragments, propelling accumulative density without clogging. Metaphors stay atmospheric-coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“the rise of a prophet begins…” echoed two sentences later) clipped –0.2. Otherwise line-level craft is clean, propulsive, and image-rich.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit—ancient weather-encoded messages received via pre-digital radio static—feels fresh yet inevitable, marrying cli-fi and mystic tech without steampunk clutter. Trope of hermit-prophet is inverted: success means obsolescence. Specificity of cobalt glass as amplifier and mirror transforms familiar mountaintop hermitage into singular site. Risk is moderate but payoff coherent; not groundbreaking, yet memorably framed.</comment>
