<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elina’s interiority is lyrically textured and her perceptual signature consistent, but her motivations remain abstract—“compile fragments into meaning” is repeated without concrete micro-choices that cost her anything on the page. The absence of a visible decision or renunciation in closure keeps the arc just shy of earned. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trumpet valve on her desk reweights exile from wound to shared story. Causality is lyric-accumulative; staggered visions tighten stakes through pattern rather than because/therefore, but the lens is coherent and the cost legible. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivory harbor’s wet stones, briny air, and hollow crates are filtered through Elina’s archivist eye; setting guides her tactile cataloguing and quietly mirrors the community’s shift from absence to presence. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transform exile’s fragments into communal meaning—tightens once: the herald-secret revelation reconfigures anger into sorrow, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is felt collectively, but no single option is personally foreclosed for Elina, keeping escalation just above minimal. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: absence made fertile, archives as living tissue. The final image of the valve as bridge quietly reprices exile from rupture to continuity, inviting reflection beyond the page while embracing moral complexity. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is ocean-salt precise, rhythms modulate with visionary bursts, and perceptual signature—“glistening stones reflected the returning sunlight”—remains Elina’s curator gaze. Compression taught early (“staggered intervals”) stays legible at closure; no head-hop or register drift. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative layer is restrained to weather-light, trumpet-gleam, tapestry. High information ratio—each line advances catalog, vision, or communal stakes—without scaffolding or mixed metaphor. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “ocean-spray archivist” who maps navigated absences gives exile fresher metaphoric scaffolding, and the herald’s valve as secret seed feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is lyric-structural rather than plot-shock, but synthesis is specific enough to avoid template drift. </comment>
