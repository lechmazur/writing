<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The watcher's interior contradiction—precision versus dread—manifests in fumbling the parachute buckle under moonlight, a concrete micro-choice that costs calm. Muscle-memory encryption and tether-grab show professional embodiment, yet the arc stays observational; no path is foreclosed, only vigilance prolonged, so renunciation feels incomplete. Emotional specificity is high; moral ambiguity muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: star-whispers, sensor anomalies, and the decoded mantra layer into a Charged Poise where survival math is rewritten but payment is still suspended. Closure is legible—trust must be re-earned under new atmospheric rules—yet the parachute remains unraveled, so decisive change is conceptual, not physical. Causality is intact; spatial/temporal anchors land by line 5; orientation waiver applies but is paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Canopy-hum in thin air, moonlit metal click, ciphered keypad—three tactile anchors that constrain every next move. The arbor functions as micro-setting: height equals exposure; cold wind equals countdown. Buckle reflections and rustling leaves mirror internal vigilance without overt symbolism, charging the final image where polished metal equals revised survival algorithm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival via pattern revision—tightens when sensors contradict star charts, forcing a new broadcast that risks credibility. One visible price: the watcher’s composure frays, voice timbre surprises self. Escalation is accumulative: each anomaly adds density; no option is foreclosed yet cost is felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “trust is a renewable atmospheric resource that must be recalculated nightly.” Subtext lives in metallic reflections and silent echoes—objects reprice the value of vigilance. Final image of the unopened parachute reframes prior duty as perpetual beta-test; no moral is stated, yet the conceptual cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression taught early—“nocturnal arbor hummed softly”—pays off in echoing cadence at close. Perceptual signature is stargazer-poetic: “every star seemed to whisper warnings.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable; diction stays within watcher’s lexicon; rhythm accelerates with sensor alerts. Voice remains singular and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence variety strong; only minor scaffold: “the watcher's burden...the pattern seeker...the watcher” noun-cycles without new payload. One paraphrase loop on “preserve trust under pressure” reprise; otherwise information density high, metaphors coherent, no register drift. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cloud-borne arbor + celestial cryptography yields fresh ecological vibe; trope of lone sentinel is retooled through atmospheric math rather than heroics. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and controlled, heightening stakes. Specific detail (encrypted keypad, Great Storm memory) prevents generic swap-out. Inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
