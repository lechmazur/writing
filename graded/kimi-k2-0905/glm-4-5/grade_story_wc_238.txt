<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eloise’s guilt and need for apology are clear, but her interiority slips into poetic self-label (“wilderness of my conscience”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The embodied moment when her trembling hand removes the glasses is strong, yet the prior motive for publishing the scandal is asserted, not shown under pressure. Beatrice’s forgiveness is moving, but its weight rests on a single line of dialogue rather than a prior micro-choice that would make the apology feel earned. Stakes rise, yet the character’s genuine struggle is intermittently abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the incomplete sheet music left on the piano reweights the reunion as forever partial, a visible cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: perfume → apparition → bridge → fade, each beat thickens nostalgia. However, the electromagnetic ritual is introduced late and its mechanics are never allowed to fail or limit tactics, so the cost feels symbolic rather than practical. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The attic’s dust-and-amber texture is vivid and purposeful, mirroring the dormant melodies. The orchard’s “hush before chainsaws” acts as a living clock, tightening the scene. Spatially, the copper-wire circle and piano are tracked cleanly. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains the séance; its silver filigree is re-emphasized at sealing, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing a spiritual breach—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (scent, shimmer, touch) raises emotional cost. The tightening beat is the arc of energy that lets fingers merge: a fleeting option that can’t be held, foreclosing perfect repair. Price is felt in Beatrice’s fade and the unfinished score, though the external orchard clock is observer-only, not an active obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—art’s power to preserve yet never fully restore—emerges through the incomplete duet. Subtext lives in gesture: the crystal stopper replaced but the song left open. The closing image avoids moralizing, offering only the poised silence of unsounded notes. One near-miss: “sometimes scissors cut clean … jagged edges” verges on articulated thesis, blunting ambiguity a hair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, consistent with an ex-columnist who thinks in metaphor. Diction like “paper coffins” and “shattered sandals” is character-specific, not ornament for its own sake. Psychic distance tightens credibly under stress: clauses shorten as the generator hums. Filter verbs are minimal; perception stays embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies, openings rotate, no template cadence detected. Metaphors occasionally crowd (“melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins” stacked beside “time tiptoes on broken glass”), creating a purple tint in an already dense paragraph, but none confuse causality. Information density is high; each sentence advances mood or ritual step. Copy is clean; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” is a fresh splice, justified by the notion of chasing stories to lay ghosts. Using electromagnetic induction to summon spirits feels novel yet internally coherent. The unfinished score as closure object is an elegant, non-obvious twist on the “uncompleted duet” trope. Some phrasing edges toward familiar lyric Gothic (“scent of jasmine and regret”), slightly diluting surprise.</comment>
