<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s “balancedly curious” trait stays ornamental; no moment shows curiosity colliding with fear or cost. The interiority drifts into thematic summary (“Navigation isn't just about direction...”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the breakthrough arrives off-stage via returned ships, the instructor’s agency is diluted—he does not pivot under live pressure. Closure still lands as earned stasis (his method accepted) so the arc holds, but the emotional price is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chain link in his palm re-weights the city’s role in humanity’s cosmic future under an Accumulative lens. Causality is intact—edge geometry predictions are confirmed—yet the decisive confirmation happens off-page, softening cost visibility. Anchor who/where/when is clear inside 120 words; no orientation debt. The ending image succeeds, but the missing on-page verification of failure/risk prevents a higher band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Benthic pressure, viewport algae, and refracted starlight are woven through Kael’s perceptual filter; the city feels lived-in rather than toured. The chain link micro-setting charges the final image and constrains his tactile calculations. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—other senses appear only briefly—but the selective detail supports tone without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—legitimizing underground celestial navigation—surfaces early and tightens when colleagues scoff. Escalation is textural: refracted patterns accumulate until external confirmation retroactively validates the method. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool breaks, no reputation lost. The absence of a live test or jeopardy caps intensity below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: celestial navigation from abyssal darkness becomes a metaphor for expanding human perspective after contact. Final whispered line (“The stars have always been there...”) reweights the chain link and algae without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: cosmic connection coexists with persistent isolation—complexity honored. One thematic echo mid-story (“interconnectedness of all movements”) is mild; no final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is steady—oceanic metaphors, acoustic imagery, gravitational phrasing. Syntax breathes with meditation sessions, then tightens at the breakthrough. No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal diction remains in character. Register never drifts into academic over-explication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during sensory measurement, lengthen during reflection. Information density is solid—many sentences perform double duty. One scaffold loop: “its weight...its surface...its circular form” within 3 lines (−0.3). Metaphors stay coherent (anchor↔gravity↔orbital paths). No typos, tense hops, or buried leads. Overall propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime relic + deep-ocean city + post-contact star navigation feels fresh; premise avoids template dystopias or evangelist first-contact tropes. The “edge geometry” concept is specific, not hand-waved, and pays off causally. Transformation test fails—swap ocean for desert and the plot still functions—so originality is moderate, not radical. Risk-taking lies in quiet scientific epiphany rather than spectacle; the gamble succeeds.</comment>
