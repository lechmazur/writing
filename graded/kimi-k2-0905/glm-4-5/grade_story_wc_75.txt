<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Khira’s embodied defiance (“The bread remembers”) and the guide’s historically-anchored ache give us two credible, contradictory drives under pressure; the micro-choice to repurpose the lens as intra-dough viewer crystallizes values and costs on the page. Minor slip: guide’s interiority drifts toward abstract mission-speak (“profound, historically oriented ache”) that slightly blurs immediate emotional contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald flare inside dough re-weights cultural memory and forecloses continued stasis; cost is felt in the lingering dread backdrop. Causal chain holds—lens reveal → dough awakening → distant ice crack—tightened under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (guide walks to bakery) is legible. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no ambiguity at ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Waterfall-grotto, bioluminescent fungi, and opera-glass-as-microscope are specific, sense-driven, and filter through the guide’s curatorial gaze; spatial choreography is clean. The lens-as-tool constrains the final choice and charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts—tightens when the lens reveals dormant life inside dough, turning abstract despair into one visible re-animation; option of permanent loss is foreclosed by the warming bread. Escalation is textural (density of light, sound, warmth) rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 600-word scope; cost is the acknowledgement that bees will not return, absorbed into the final glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultural continuity through embodied craft emerges via action—initial-shaped dough, opera-glass microscope—never sermonized. Final re-pricing: memory can be re-kindled without its original pollinator, a resonant non-moral. Rosewater dread motif threads without overt symbolic declaration, earning complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to guide’s curatorial perceptual signature: “emerald-tinted,” “rosewater dread,” “historically oriented.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure; no head-hop. Khira’s rasp (“The bread remembers”) is idiolect-distinct from narrator’s elevated register—intentional status contrast that holds under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative layering is dense but patterned—green/ice/bread triad—paid off in final flare. No scaffold loops; one near-paraphrase (“rosewater dread” repeated) forgiven because it accrues thematic resonance. Clean grammar, precise verbs (“pinch,” “knead,” “flaring”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of opera-glass microscopy, bee-deprived hive-mind city, and initial-bread mnemonics feels novel yet inevitable; trope of “dying culture” is re-energized through microbial vision. Risk in magical lens is grounded by baker’s tactile craft, making conceptual repricing credible.</comment>
