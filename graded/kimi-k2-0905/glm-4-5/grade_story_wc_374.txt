<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic’s interior contradiction—charting weather with empirical tools while tasting cosmic ballot-boxes—is dramatized in embodied beats (metallic/salty palate, vibrating ring). Their acceptance of storm-carriership is foreshadowed by grand-father lore and charged micro-choice to clasp the storm-man’s hand; the cost (“forever merging”) is felt. Still, the shift from detached observer to willing vessel pivots on a single handshake; deeper resistance/complicity knots could sharpen the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass dissolves into skin, undeniable conceptual cost (“ancient responsibility”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored aurora tallies + forest murmurs tighten from first line to last, reweighting prior research question into lived office. Spatial/temporal anchors (bluff, night, continuous scene) are clear <120 words; orientation intact. No meaningful escalation gap; the final image fuses premise to person with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, aurora overhead, and vibrating tin ring function as micro-setting that literally steers choice (ring glow charts energy, lavender blooms react). Sensory triangulation—metallic, ozone, salt, honey—maps proximity to convergence; environment governs attention and decision. Specificity is high yet economical; no exposition dump. Could edge higher if bluff terrain (drop-off, wind shear) physically threatened stance during the handshake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will they accept or refuse elemental symbiosis—surfaces early (“their life now, chasing weather carriers”) and tightens when ring ignites. Single meaningful deepening: metallic taste sweetens to rain-memory just before handshake, signaling internal swing. Cost is conceptual but palpable at closure; no later option to remain detached. Escalation is linear, not twisty, yet sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: ecological citizenship whereby humans can be elected vessels of planetary seasons. No abstract thesis; argument carried by taste, vote metaphors, and culminating merger. Resonant non-moral answer: stewardship begins by ingesting the storm, not debating it. Subtle counter-readings possible—critique of charismatic destiny vs scientific detachment—add complexity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (“tasted of ozone and copper,” “tears weather embedded”) is distinct, consistent, and biased toward synesthetic sampling. Syntax stays compressed yet lyrical; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue minimal, thunder-toned; voice convergence acceptable at transformative touch. No head-hop; POV distance stable inside luminous skeptic.</comment>

<comment>High information density: compound images (“aurora pulsed… voting algorithms”) perform scene work while layering metaphor. Rhythm modulates: breathless pre-handshake cadence, then ionized stillness. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Pronoun and spatial tracking clean. Opening/final lines anchor and recharge motif. Artifacts absent; closure beat crystal clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Forest election” conceit reframes climate agency into participatory democracy; fresh without gimmickry. Storm-man as sentient atmospheric caucus transforms weather-person trope into symbiotic office. Specificity (ring vibration codes, taste-shift as poll data) makes premise irreplaceable. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echo. Conceptual integrity maintained to dissolution of compass in skin.</comment>
