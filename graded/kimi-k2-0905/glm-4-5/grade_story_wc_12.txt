<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation—prove the entity’s arrogance—stays visible, but interiority stays priest-centric; Sarah is a puppet, never a second will in play. Micro-choice registers only in pedal presses and paint strokes; the moment he smiles at the hidden assumption is the single beat where interior contradiction surfaces. Earned cost is present (anchor left humming, priest exhausted), yet the child’s reclaimed silence is felt more than his. Voice remains coherent, but the absence of Sarah’s interior keeps the relational crucible cool.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is lean and legible: pedal → layered chant → entity confusion → paint glyphs → anchor lock → silence break → expulsion. Orientation locked by word 60; dimensional rules taught through color-frequency pairing. Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary’s stillness is rewoven into a charged hush that now excludes the intruder; the cost is the lingering hum that keeps the priest tethered to future vigilance. No retro-fitted abilities or world-rule patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting works: loop pedal, indigo palette, and the altar-formed anchor constrain every tactical move. Sensory economy favors sound and color density over visual panorama; silence itself is rendered as weight and pressure. Texture is specific—indigo that “absorbs light,” pedal layers that “build sonic architecture.” No geography drift; spatial choreography stays clean as the priest circles the altar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save Sarah before final integration—is signaled early and tightened by the live pedal/chant progression. Escalation is procedural rather than reversal-heavy: each layer narrows the entity’s options until rhetorical paradox collapses its claim. Cost is legible—anchor’s residual hum, priest’s tremor, and the silence that now demands future guardianship. Agency is ritual-based, not character-debated, yet still forecloses the path the entity aimed to take.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme coils around silence as creative void and protective barrier; the final re-woven hush reweights the opening “unraveled stillness” without sermonizing. Subtext lives in pedal loops as mortal discipline imposing form on chaos. The single-color palette returns as both void-source and seal, letting the image do the moral math. No abstract thesis statement—meaning is left humming in the air, inviting reflection on cost and continuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to the priest; perceptual signature is sonic-tactile, privileging frequency, breath, tremor. Syntax lengthens during layering, then fractures into short beats at expulsion, mirroring ritual tempo. Diction stays within priestly lexicon—incantatory but never florid. No head-hop; Sarah’s voice is purely ventriloquized, keeping focalization clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: most sentences advance chant layer, glyph stroke, or entity reaction simultaneously. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (sound = architecture, silence = fabric). One mixed comparison—“muffled clarity”—is intentional, thematic, not accidental. Rhythm breathes with ritual escalation; final paragraph slows into resonant hush without momentum drop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of loop-pedal tech with exorcism feels inevitable, not gimmicky; the sonic-containment logic is fully committed. Tropes of priest vs demon are flipped: victory via rhetorical paradox rather than crucifix and Latin. Indigo-as-void/shield and silence-as-substance are particularized, not borrowed symbols. Risk is taken and paid off—the piece never hedges toward conventional rite or explain-away.</comment>
