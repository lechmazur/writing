<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling fingers, the held breath, the memory of soil—but the crystallization affliction is label-only until the fingertip prickle, so the stakes never feel bodily. The grandmother voice is invoked twice yet produces no contradictory impulse or new knowledge; it calms rather than complicates. The final “work perfectly executed” is declared, not dramatized, so the cost of converting scars into warnings is asserted rather than felt. Still, her micro-choice to keep breathing while the platform tilts shows a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she exhales only after the quill tip falls, signaling the transformation is complete and the path foreclosed. Causality holds—because she revisits the superstition, crystallization halts—yet the platform tilt is external coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of memory and ritual reweights the stake until the final image (“saturated hush”) reconfigures meaning. Cost is visible in the shed tip, but the scars’ conversion is summarized, not shown, blunting the decisiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, inkwell glow, and tea steam are sharply sensed and filter through Elara’s scholar gaze—she notices quill trim and ink viscosity. Spatial choreography is clean: knees, parchment, cylinder track across the tilting stone. The “saturated hush” functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. No environment or tool constrains a late tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but the selective detail keeps atmosphere alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn scars into living warnings—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: platform tilts → crystallization threat → ritual recalled to halt it. The tightening is textural, not causal, and the price (quill tip shed) is small, not viscerally tied to the scars. Still, agency remains hers; luck complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: pain rendered into protective knowledge via ritual. The grandmother garden memory reweights at the end when the “saturated hush” becomes the new soil where wisdom grows. No moral is stated; the image of the rolled parchment in crystal offers quiet conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—will future scholars heed the warnings?—but complexity is slight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays anchored to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“luminescent liquid,” “metaphorically trimmed tip”) reflects scholarly precision. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in memory, staccato clauses during tilt. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is zero. Filter verbs (“she imagined”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is natural; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk—“steam like miniature dragons” beside “crystallized fear”—but both serve POV bias and do not clash. Information density is high; each sentence layers ink, memory, or threat. Minor scaffold: “the tea set before her steamed gently” could compress, but it anchors the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The “scars → rune stories” concept is fresh, and the crystallization affliction literalizes emotional freezing. Garden-shed superstition knots are specific childhood texture. Yet the floating rock platform is familiar anime vista, and the storm-breath timing feels convenient. Synthesis is personal enough to avoid checklist flavor but not radically new.</comment>
