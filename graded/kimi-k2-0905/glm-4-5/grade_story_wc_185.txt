<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is thin; we get duty (“preserve the ancient patterns”) but no contradictory impulse or embodied emotion while the cave is literally being torn apart. Micro-choices are reported (“they traced the pattern”) rather than lived; the moment of conjuring carries no visible cost or physical toll, so the final smile feels unearned. The single POV keeps the field clear, yet the character never surprises us or reveals a flaw that complicates the cure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a tidy CR—the bloom of hush reweights the premise and the beings harmonize—but the cost is only asserted (“the stone now resonated differently”) rather than dramatized on the body or the cave. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and cadence shifts at the end, satisfying the lens rule. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words, but causality between ice-crack reading and perfect counter-frequency remains magical rather than demonstrated, blunting the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting specificity is the story’s strength: ripple-mark walls, never-melted ice, echo chamber stone, and distorted light are vivid and purposeful. The harmonic caves function as both environment and tool, constraining the mapkeeper’s sonic tactics and charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent through a single continuous traverse. The ice-crack method, however, is described rather than shown in action, so the critical beat feels abstract.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—save the patterns—is declared early but never visibly jeopardized; we are told marks are “damaged” yet never see one effaced, so tension stays conceptual. Escalation is a single smooth ramp: arrive → read → conjure → harmony; no narrowing of options or trade-off tests the mapkeeper. The energy beings shift from threat to allies off-stage, so pressure evaporates rather than tightens. Cost is asserted (“stone tuned to new frequency”) but not felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—harmony through receptive stillness rather than domination—emerges cleanly via the bloom of hush image, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is thin; the mapkeeper’s silence is never contrasted with a failed attempt to fight the beings, so the insight feels pre-ordained. The final line’s “seed of all harmony” drifts toward platitude, slightly undercutting conceptual repricing. Still, the particular sonic world keeps the abstraction grounded.</comment>

<comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance, with rhythmic, clause-stacked sentences that mimic wave resonance. Perceptual signature is present—the mapkeeper reads by touch and tonal vibration—which distinguishes the POV. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narrative texture; occasional template cadence (“They began… They would…”) flattens the rhythm. Filter verbs are minimal, but overuse of gentle, resonant, harmonic clusters edges toward stylistic self-parody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and mostly loop-free; information density is high with few scaffold sentences. Mixed metaphors are avoided, but stacked modifiers (“gentle luminosity,” “profound quiet”) recur without fresh inflection. The climactic conjuring beat is overwritten: three consecutive sentences open with “The stone…” creating template cadence that dulls propulsion. Otherwise, grammar and sequence are clean, and the read-aloud rhythm supports the sonic premise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—acoustic cave librarian negotiates with chaotic energy beings via counter-sound bloom—is fresh and non-obvious. The synthesis of geology, music theory, and alien ecology feels organic rather than checklist. Risk is present but safe: harmony is achieved without sacrifice, so the story avoids darker implications of its own physics. The idea lingers, yet its emotional payoff is muted because no unique cultural or personal cost is exacted.</comment>
