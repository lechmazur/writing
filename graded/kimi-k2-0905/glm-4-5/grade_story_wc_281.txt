<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s “affectionate skeptic” duality is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment where she must act against type; the interior monologue stays safely diagnostic (“her affectionate skepticism had evolved into determined conviction”) instead of showing simultaneous contradictory impulses. Her brother’s suffering is the stated engine, yet no concrete memory or sensory cue of him intrudes to twist her gut mid-experiment; heart-rate sync is reported, not felt. The single micro-choice—packing the sliver at dawn—arrives only after the experimental beats have already succeeded, so it registers as aftermath rather than costly decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is present as a soft Charged Poise: the new protocol is declared, the geode tucked “against her heart,” and hope is rebranded from fragile to “lighting her way.” Cost, however, is conceptual rather than dramatized—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated light-pattern imagery and heartbeat micro-data accrete until meaning crystallizes, but the final sentence drifts into explicit thesis (“she became a believer…”) which mildly blunts the reconfiguration. Orientation is secure inside the studio within the first 60 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<comment>The light-painting studio functions as both crucible and instrument: every camera angle, sweep of red/blue light, and geode glint is tethered to Maya’s attempt to “map the hidden pathways,” so environment directly constrains tactics. Sensory economy is good—sound is mostly absent, touch (static shock, chill skin) and sight (fractal lattice on the wall) carry the beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; lens, geode, and her body remain trackable. The studio never evolves beyond its initial state, so it supports but does not deepen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—heal the pill-damaged brains—circles reliably around Maya’s brother, but escalation is textural, not causal: each new light pattern adds density rather than narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the experiment simply keeps succeeding until she “finally devised the protocol.” The only visible price is late-night fatigue, too mild for the declared scale of disaster. Pressure coheres but never tightens to a point where failure feels possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the fractal metaphor (order within apparent chaos) quietly links geode lattice → neural tangle → healing pattern, avoiding explicit sermon. The final image of the geode resting over her heart reweights “willowglass hope” from fragile to instrumental without verbal moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: belief is in “human spirit,” not magic, keeping skepticism alive. One soft echo of prompt language in the last paragraph costs a sliver of subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person single POV stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter; scientific diction (“somatic markers,” “synaptic chaos”) is justified by her researcher stance. Rhythm clusters short clauses under studio strobes, then lengthens at dawn—effective cadence mirroring shift from frenzy to resolution. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on interiority, which occasionally slips into template repetition (“fractally precise” appears four times). No head-hopping or distance leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but “fractally precise” and “light painting studio” become percussive refrains without accruing new charge. Two near-paraphrase loops: “motivation to illuminate hidden pathways” vs “illuminate hidden pathways in the brain,” and “static shock that had changed everything” repeated. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks; information density is high. Artifacts are moderate—do not obscure closure—but the refrain fatigue keeps the prose short of luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The telepathy-pill-recall angle is fresh scaffolding, and the choice to treat the geode as an optical neural lens rather than new-age talisman smartly inverts expectations. Recurrent fractal imagery fuses object, method, and theme in a way that would collapse if swapped for any other crystal. risk is moderate—accumulative lyric structure rather than dramatic reversal—but the synthesis feels specific to this narrator’s grief. Not groundbreaking, yet memorably particular.</comment>
