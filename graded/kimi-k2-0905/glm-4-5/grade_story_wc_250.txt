<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Guardian’s “spiralingly calm” is vivid but static; no interior contradiction surfaces under pressure. Visitor’s half-secret never presses a decision, so the emotional cost stays abstract. The final nod is too slight to register as earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unspoken secret is reweighted by the completed star-pattern, cost felt in the mirror going dark. Causal chain is thin—visitor never acts—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation clear by 50 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick shutters, and dental-mirror reflections form a micro-setting that actively constrains every gesture. Light-angle mechanics are tracked shot-by-shot; spatial choreography never drifts. Mirror’s final blackout charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no concrete price is risked or lost. Escalation is textural: each shutter adjustment deepens the pattern rather than narrowing options. Tightening is beautiful but intellectual; pressure plateaus instead of peaking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light without shadow is meaningless. Final star-pattern reconfigures the secret’s weight without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the concept’s abstraction keeps emotional aftereffect just shy of full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, ritual cadence that matches the guardian’s calm. Sentence rhythm modulates with the shutter clicks; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric, never breaking the spell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence layers image, motion, and concept. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Only minor scaffold: “spiralingly calm” is repeated without fresh inflection late in the text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Silent lamplight-weaving guardian with a dental mirror is a fresh synthesis; the conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the piece commits fully. Could edge higher if the secret carried a sharper twist.</comment>
