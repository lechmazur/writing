<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s claustrophobia and cleithrophobia are dramatized through crouched posture, trembling hands, and controlled breathing, grounding the fear in the body. The stunt-double résumé is asserted rather than shown and never complicates tactics; the “billionaire daughter” reveal feels plot-twist convenient, not character-earned. Interiority is vivid (“stars peek through broken skylight” refracted by her panic), but the final epiphany about vulnerability-as-power is articulated, not dramatized via a micro-choice that costs her anything on the spot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya stands, seashell to heart, hunters entering—an image that reweights all prior masquerade with undeniable cost (“herself, whole and unbroken”). Causality holds: because mentor betrayed → she hides → decrypts cast → confronts. Library orientation and midnight deadline are anchored by word 120; no disorientation. One causal gap: how the plaster cast appeared behind a false spine is unexplained, a teleporting-prop micro-flaw that nips the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Rusted shelves, broken skylight constellations, and phosphorescent glow on plaster ridges create tactile, selective density; the library’s decay doubles as emotional corollary. The seashell half functions as micro-setting, warming under palm to signal decryption climax—an object that constrains her grip and focuses attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: crouch → trace cast → stand at doors; no impossible moves. Environment never becomes mere postcard; every visual is filtered through panic-sharpened perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“truth vs. permanent silencing”—is signaled early and tightens geometrically: midnight clock + approaching footsteps compress options. Middle beat (decrypting cast) is the earned agency that flips hunter/prey dynamic. Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons iron control (her life-long survival tactic) to embrace exposure. One minor slip: the Organization’s on-page pressure is shadowy off-stage threat rather than an immediate adaptive challenge inside the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges through image chain—seashell whisper, child-hand cast, starlight on fear-sweat—rather than overt thesis, until the final sentence states it outright (−0.4). Subtext operates stronger in gesture: clutching shell to heart = accepting fragility as weapon. The broken skylight’s starlight literalizes “being seen” after lifetime of doubling others. Final articulation is redundant; the stance crystallization already speaks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature vivid (“ethereal patterns on decaying books” filtered through panic). Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences under starlight, staccato fragments as footsteps approach. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs minimal; body-based perception dominates. Register remains in character—no academic drift. Slight syntactic repetition of “stars / starlight” thrice within 80 words creates template echo (−0.2) but doesn’t blur clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly crisp: information-dense lines (“phosphorescent glow…made faint writing slightly easier”) do double duty. One paraphrase loop: “heart pounding…heart-pounding fear” recycles same beat. Metaphors stay coherent (stars as witness, shell as maternal voice). No simultaneity errors; tense stable. Final clause “unbroken” nicely inverts seashell’s earlier fragility, showing micro-level turnaround rather than tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—orphan-heir, shadowy syndicate, magical shell—are re-anchored in claustrophobic library under starlight, giving fresh spatial charge. The stunt-double-with-phobias angle adds irony but isn’t exploited tactically in the scene itself, reducing freshness. Cast-as-cipher is a novel prop twist. Conceptual risk: embracing vulnerability as combat stance feels earned here, not preacherly, because panic is physically dramatized. Overall, a non-obvious synthesis, but still relies on stock thriller scaffolding.</comment>
