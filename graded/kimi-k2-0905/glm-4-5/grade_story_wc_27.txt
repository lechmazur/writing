<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her transformation is declared (“now she understood that she was the meaning”) rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her something visible. The opera glasses fall, yet this is shrugged off; no contradictory impulse complicates her ascent to “regal” stance, so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: the hum, light, and barefoot contact build a crescendo that reweights the stake from scavenging the mess to becoming its meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—arms raised, light rising—whose cost is the abandonment of her former tool (glasses) and implied surrender to the stones’ claim; the lens is coherent, but the beat could be sharper if one earlier option were explicitly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spaceport debris, fractured ceiling, and settling metal create tactile specificity; the barefoot soles act as micro-setting that constrains path and amplifies vulnerability. The stone circle’s sudden appearance is the one credibility stretch, yet it is internally consistent as a discovered liminal zone, and its hum directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find meaning in ruin—tightens when the circle’s hum demands she trade her telescope (glasses) for direct embodiment of meaning. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (dust, hum, light) raises the cost of retreat, culminating in the stance crystallization. No visible price beyond dropped glasses, so cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-embodiment emerges organically from the barefoot contact and the circle’s demand for physical presence. The final image reprises “margin of daylight” as liminal space where ruin transmutes into vessel—an earned, non-didactic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cosmic, sustained through rhythmic long sentences and stellar vocabulary (“technological ambition,” “cosmos”) that matches the stargazer’s idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent: toes curl, brass warms, hum soaks into bone—no filter-verb drift. Compression (“thunderous serenity”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Generally clean, but occasional modifier stacks (“awkwardly confident stride”) and three successive “something X, something Y, something timeless” clauses create template cadence that dulls final ascent. Otherwise high density—each sentence layers sensory or symbolic pressure—and no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing stone-circle mysticism with derelict spaceport is a fresh synthesis; barefoot stargazer as meaning-catalyst feels specific rather than archetype. Risky lyric escalation stays coherent, and the ruin-to-relic transformation offers a non-obvious reconfiguration of hope.</comment>
