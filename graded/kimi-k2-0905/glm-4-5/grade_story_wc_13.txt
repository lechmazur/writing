<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The illustrator’s interiority stays thin—no contradictory impulses surface in-scene; all motive is declared (“His motivation burned within him”). The single micro-choice (shatter the cage) arrives without prior tactical use of the pendant to foreshadow cost, so the final sacrifice feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the restored cadence reweights the world, and the illustrator’s shortened future is legible. Causal linkage is present but light; the “borrowed time” rule is asserted more than demonstrated, so the cost is felt only at the tag end, not through tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The rooftop canal system is insistently specific—water-crystal map, stone troughs, tower canyons—and directly steers the chase. Micro-setting (pendant, sketchbook) is handled, but only the canals constrain the final approach; the cage room is vivid yet generic, keeping it below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (restore cadence before giant wakes) is signaled early and tightens once when breathing clouds appear. Agency is reactive—he follows the crystal map rather than testing/altering it—so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is paid in a lump at the end, not incrementally shaping moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: interference with primal sound = ecological rupture; restoring it costs the artist’s own time. The infinity pendant never accrues shifting meaning, and the giant-as-reality-dreamer stays abstract, so resonance is moderate—no final image re-weights prior motifs beyond the single tone release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, lyrical, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature shows in selective notice of fauna, crystal patterns. Syntax stays elevated throughout, lacking stress-induced fragmentation, so modulation is limited; nevertheless, no head-hopping or register drift, and elision is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythm varied, high noun specificity (“crystal-like patterns,” “canyons between towers”). Minor template cadence in “he” opener clusters and a few stacked metaphors (“echoes are born,” “cadence that should have been flowing… like a heartbeat”) keep it from the 9-band; no loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing urban-ecology sketching with time-sculpting against a dreaming-giant is fresh; the “place where echoes are born” offers a conceptual twist on sound-world myths. Execution relies on familiar quest beats, and the pendant’s time-loan mechanic is standard SF currency, trimming the score from exceptional to solidly original.</comment>
