<comment>The otherworldly sentimentalist has a coherent, if abstract, interior motive—deliver illumination without combustion—and the text keeps returning to that desire. Yet it never makes a micro-choice whose cost we can feel; the transit simply happens, the gear keeps spinning, and the enlightenment spreads without visible renunciation or risk. Interiority is stardust-poetic but generic (“eternal yet changing, complete yet yearning”) rather than embodied. The result is a stylized sensibility rather than a character whose contradictions act under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pressure accrues through repeating image-clusters (petals, pings, gear) that tighten the emotional cadence rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final “troubling serenity” image reweights all prior transits. Cost is conceptual (cyclical rise-and-fall may never break) but not dramatized on-page; the being suffers no forfeiture. Orientation is deliberately cosmic, so the 120-word anchor test is waived, but the piece still drifts in dream-logic that keeps the stakes vaporous.</comment>

<comment>Nebula garden is evoked in saturated, shifting color that mirrors the being’s mood; petals function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial grounding is intentionally fluid—distances and physics bend—but the sensory selection (soft luminescence, dying-star petals) stays purposeful. Gear-as-tool repeatedly constrains action: faster spin equals deeper transit, so the object qualifies as setting-in-motion. World rules remain consistent: sonar pings map, gear approximates, light never burns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can this civilization keep the light without self-immolation—is signaled early and re-echoed through generational dread. Pressure escalates only in lyrical density: each petal-stanza thickens the cosmic melancholy rather than narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the being neither hesitates nor forfeits anything during transit. The outcome feels inevitable, not earned through a tightening choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge can be gifted gently, yet entropy may still cycle. The motif of “light without fire” recharges across returns without being named in summation. Final image of gear resuming its infinite spin gives a CR that reweights the premise: every illumination is already being erased. Complexity is honored—no moral is delivered—but the insight stays cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains a consistent incantatory cadence; diction is elevated but cosmically apt (“quiet sigh of falling petals”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is stardust-diffuse, registering color shifts and sonar harmonics rather than humanoid fixations. Rhythm swells and subsides with transit beats, creating purposeful breathing. Occasional template cadence (“Across the quiet sigh…”) is borderline hypnotic rather than mechanical, so not penalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined—metaphors stay within cosmic physics, no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; each sentence layers image and concept. Repetitive anaphora (“The calculating machine gear…”) approaches loop territory yet serves mantra-like pattern, so only −0.3. No scaffold or synonym churn obscures closure; final line snaps clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentient nebula librarian ferrying abstract math-gear as memory-palimpsest feels fresh; trope of missionary enlightenment is inverted—no coercion, no flame. Petals as time-currency and sonar as empathy-radar are specific inflections not interchangeable with generic SF furniture. Conceptual risk—plotless lyric meditation—mostly pays off because the repeating gear-image supplies causal glue. Still, the piece circles rather than transforms, keeping it shy of top band.</comment>
