<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liam’s contradictory states—hopeful ferryman / fractured survivor—are stated via backstory blocks rather than dramatized micro-choices in the present scene; the “hourglass” and “vanishing ferry” act as external proxies for interiority, so his moment-to-moment emotional risk never quite lands under pressure. The final sense of wholeness is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the once-empty hourglass fills, marking timeline merger with visible cost (Liam is now “ephemeral”). Causality is loose—patterns taught late, radio beats merely confirm rather than alter—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, and the final image reweights prior motifs. Orientation is functional; only the “interconnected patterns” remain abstract until payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The spectral grotto’s liquid-starlight water and triple moons are vividly etched, supply the magical rule-set, and charge the final merger image. Micro-setting (hourglass, ferry console) doubles as tool and talisman, constraining Liam’s actions via touch-glow cues. Selective sensory detail favors luminous visuals; other senses are under-used, keeping it just shy of top-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—timeline merger—surfaces early and tightens once when the parallel ferry appears; escalation is mostly atmospheric (grotto vibration, pattern glow) rather than a hard choice that forecloses an option. Cost is conceptual (permanent transience) rather than viscerally felt on the page, limiting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fractured identity seeking wholeness emerges through the hourglass and ferry motifs; the final sand-blend image reweights earlier emptiness without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit, though the childhood accident is summarized, not dramatized, reducing resonance. Avoids tidy thesis yet lacks a fresh ethical twist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres cleanly to Liam; perceptual signature favors luminous, rhythmic diction (“liquid starlight,” “clocks run sideways”) that matches cosmic scale. Minor register drift into abstract physics phrases, but voice remains consistent and propulsive under climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm, vivid metaphor, high density; occasional stacked epithets (“ancient chronal energy older than humanity”) verge on purple but don’t stall clarity. Zero loops or scaffold; temporal sequencing clean. One mixed metaphor (“patterns glow...like a lover”) momentarily jars, yet closure image stays sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Blends Celtic ferryman myth with time-slip scifi; the sideways-clock rule and hourglass-as-timeline-vessel feel fresh, not checklist. Risk-taking lies in lyric cosmic scale compressed into flash; it largely succeeds, though the childhood trauma split is a familiar device. Specific lunar triad and neural-sand image linger.</comment>
