<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “wise fool” contradiction is dramatized in two on-page micro-choices: the public self-diminishment to the official and the private decision to thread coded sabotage. Interiority is concrete (“stitched her needle through star-flecked fabric” vs. “feigned confusion”), but emotions stay slightly performed rather than rawly embodied. The final stance—continuing to embroider while the coup collapses off-stage—is a credible renunciation, yet the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt, keeping her short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each embroidery session tightens the conspiracy’s clock because the star anomalies she spots directly enable the micro-sabotage plan. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the finished tapestry reframes her “fool” label into covert power—visible in the image of the candle-lit cloth hanging while arrests happen unseen. One minor causality slip: “adjacent possibilities” are asserted but never shown narrowing her options; the reader must infer mechanics. Still, the coup fails because of her embroidered delays, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, prismatic windows, and the eternal candle’s moving flame create a tactile, lived–in observatory that doubles as micro-setting; the candle’s flare length-changes mark beat-shifts. Autumn leaves and “echoed silence” supply atmospheric counter-point, but environment never actively constrains her tactical choices—she could have worked in any quiet room. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies track across the hall. Meets 9-band gate only weakly: candle images charge the final line but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prevent coup without exposing herself”—is signaled by the impossible galaxy triad and escalates when she translates it into human sabotage. Agency is iterative embroidery decisions that foreclose direct confrontation; each threaded delay tightens the plotters’ window until off-stage arrests collapse the plan. Cost remains conceptual (perpetual outsider mask) rather than a concrete loss on her body or resources, just missing the visible-price band. Escalation is steady but singular; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “invisible labor rewrites power”—wisdom disguised as decoration literally unravels patriarchal conspiracy. Subtext operates in the officials’ condescending dialogue and the tapestry’s unread language. Final image of the silent, candle-lit hall invites reflection on who history credits, but the piece ends with a gentle nod rather than a charged reprice. Avoids overt moralizing; complexity stays intact. Ambiguity is purposeful yet slightly safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays latched to Elara’s perception; diction (“star-flecked fabric,” “prismatic tears”) is lyric yet internally consistent. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for cosmic scale, clipped fragments under sabotage urgency. No head-hop; POV modesty respected—she guesses officials’ motives from overheard shards. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-level metaphors) risks purple but stays justified by her celestial craft. Voice is distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory density with mixed-metaphor vigilance (“windows catching dying light like prismatic tears” edges to stacked image). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop: “whispers swirled… echoed silence” twice invokes quiet without new pressure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“stitched,” “swelled”) propel. Closure line is clean, foregoing explanatory clutter. Artifacts present but do not touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and espionage feels fresh; utilitarian tapestry as both code and artwork is specific to this world. Risk taken in quiet victory—coup fails off-stage—pays off because the reweighting of her “fool” label happens on-page. Adjacent-possibility angle is under-explained, trimming full originality points. Details (tartan smock, eternal candle) individuate rather than decorate. Premise transformed through concrete craft rather than abstract spy tropes.</comment>
