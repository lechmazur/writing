<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and sensorily anchored; the traveler’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the weft thread while writing deaths for the living—are dramatized in real time. Micro-choice (uncapping the pen for Thomas) crystallizes values. Cost is felt: “anchor and burden” line foreshadows the shift to compass. The self-obituary turn is earned, but the gardener remains off-page, so relationship crucible and status pressure are inactive; cap applies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of image-density (thread, garden, autumn, starlight) tightens toward the traveler’s self-reckoning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—thread becomes compass, writing turns inward—charged with conceptual cost: “a river of explanations” is now dammed. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Slight over-reliance on lyrical summary between beats prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shadowed garden functions as micro-setting: decay-scent, leaf-motion, and the weft thread on the bench constrain mood and ultimately the pen’s movement. Spatial choreography stays clean (bench → soil → notebook → stars). Autumn is exploited for tonal mirroring rather than cliché. The thread as charged object satisfies 9+ gate by guiding the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the traveler map his own absence before night falls? Pressure escalates via density—each new sensory layer (scent, starlight, memory) tightens the need to convert observation into self-writing. The “river of explanations” line marks visible cost paid. Agency remains introspective but causally legible; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “healing geography”: wounds become pathways, not dead ends. No explicit moral; final image of thread-as-compass reweights earlier destruction. Subtext carried in gesture—fingers tracing thread rather than verbalized grief. Avoids thematic echo; no final-paragraph sermon. Complexity accepted: traveler may still be lost, but stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature relies on synesthetic compression (“earth, decay, and the lingering perfume of vanished blooms”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, staccato noun-triplets for sensory saturation. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register remains within traveler’s lexicon; no academic drift. Patterned repetition (“shadowed garden”) is taught early and pays off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“The crimson weft thread…fragile than spun sugar when held against the weight of memory”). One paraphrase loop (“river of explanations…explained absence”) docks −0.3. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence earns its emphatic repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Obituaries-for-the-living premise is fresh, yet grounded in post-war displacement. Thread-from-destroyed-palace object avoids contrivance by doubling as anchor/burden/compass. Risky lyric density is justified by accumulative lens and pays off at closure. Transformation test fails if garden/thread swapped, confirming specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
