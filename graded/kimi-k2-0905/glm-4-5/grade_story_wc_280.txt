<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Silas’s yearning for “encores that could never end” is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a contradictory interior moment; the synesthetic gift is colorful label-work rather than a pressure-forced flaw. His final dissolution is graceful yet cost-free: no visible relinquishment of a live option, no embodied tension between staying and going. Character depth stalls at atmospheric nostalgia.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory echoes and color-ribbons layer toward the final cadence. Closure attains Charged Poise—the garden’s renewed glow and the vanishing coin reconfigure meaning—but the cost is only implied (“spectral essence” spent). Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore; timeline mending is metaphorical, its mechanism asserted not tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Moonlit maze, mossy stone stage, and synesthetic orchard are vividly filtered through Silas’s singer-performer bias: scents “taste,” applause lingers as perfume. Spatial choreography stays clean across translucent drift and echo-bounce. Final image—the garden glowing more vibrantly—uses setting as micro-setting that recharges the closure. Meets 9+ gate: the garden’s charged state is inseparable from the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes—save the orchard from timeline despair—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete consequence (loss of song, loss of self) is risked on the page. Escalation is tonal intensification rather than narrowing options: each lyrical echo adds texture, never jeopardizing the success we’re assured is possible. Cost is lyrically implied, not tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of art-as-afterlife emerges through recurrent performance metaphors rather than overt statement. Nostalgia is the medium, not a message; the final dissolving bow offers resonant non-literal answer to “what lasts?” Avoids sermon, but the conceptual reweighting is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Silas’s synesthetic register: “silver-blue glow that tasted of thunder” is idiosyncratic and consistent. Rhythm modulates with song-crescendo, no head-hop. Filter verbs (“he could almost smell”) are few and voice-motivated. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal song-lexicon remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm rises and falls with musical cadence; metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic rule-set. No loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction (“temporal fragments,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift. High density maintained; final line lands cleanly. Minor over-figuration in middle paragraph keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-tenor healing time-garden via sung echoes is fresh synthesis; synesthesia plus tarot coin plus orchard is quirky yet coherent. Risk is lyric-static rather than stakes-shifting, so innovation feels ornamental not transformative. Specificity of “hand-painted tarot coin” and “pink petals tasting like laughter” counters generic tropes, but premise still leans on familiar elegiac mode.</comment>
