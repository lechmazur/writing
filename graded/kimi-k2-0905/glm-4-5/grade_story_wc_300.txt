<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The inspector’s interiority is vivid—“heartbeat of a hesitation” crystallizes her pivot—but the epiphany leans on abstract therapeutic shorthand (“dissolve the walls between hearts”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro-choice to lift the pearl is dramatized and costly, yet the crown transformation feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from flaw. Earned-Stasis closure lands because she accepts perpetual invisible weight, but the absence of a second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relationship crucible off the table. Voice remains consistent and individualized; still, the moment of absorption of “pure emotion” skirts diagnostic-speak, blunting the highest band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown’s invisible weight reconfigures her mission with undeniable conceptual cost—“walls… could be dissolved.” Causal linkage holds: discovery of passage → pearl → crown → new purpose, each beat a because/therefore step. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“concrete corridors”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes options under Causal drive. Persistent constraint—the crown’s perpetual light only she senses—shapes later tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bunker and crystal caves function as macro-setting, but the pearl-as-micro-setting is what constrains choice and literally reshapes on her head. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: inspector notices schematics, concrete dust, then the breathing light of pearl—professional gaze escalates to wonder. Spatial choreography is flawless; flashlight beam, footsteps swallowed, pedestal center all track cleanly. The final image of crown-light reflecting off every cave surface anchors the Charged Poise, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor withholding: we never learn city/season, but disorientation serves the liminal payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she use the discovery to reconnect humanity?—is signaled in the first third and tightened when she lifts the pearl with “trembling fingers,” paying a visceral cost. Escalation is causal: each new chamber increases knowledge and narrows her future; refusal to seal the bunkers becomes inevitable. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. The price—perpetual invisible crown—alters tactics and is legible on the page, meeting the 8.8+ gate test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete image chain: bunkers-as-walls → pearl-as-absorber → crown-as-bridge, culminating in the conceptual repricing that the apocalypse is disconnection, not mushroom clouds. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line offers a charged image—“state of disconnection that could be healed”—letting reader complete the thought. Subtext operates in silence: the “resonant hush” is both literal cave acoustics and metaphor for listening across divides. Emotional aftereffect lingers: reader leaves hearing that hush, reconsidering their own walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>POV remains tight third-person singular with no leakage; “her flashlight beam,” “she noticed,” etc., keep distance consistent. Perceptual signature is occupational—schematics, concrete, inspection rhythm—then mutates to luminous mystic perception without violating lexicon. Syntax mirrors arc: clipped procedural cadence early (“practiced efficiency”), then lengthens, softens as light takes over. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; phrases like “latent radiance” stay within the inspector’s awestruck diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: short declaratives for corridor tension, then elongated, breath-paced clauses in the caves. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—“liquid sunlight” for warmth, “crown of living light” for transformation. Minor scaffold: “abandoned hopes” is repeated three times; still, the reprise reweights meaning at closure, so the penalty is capped at −0.2. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image; propulsion remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bunker-to-crystal-cave pivot reweights familiar apocalypse tropes into interior repair; the pearl-as-absorber of forsaken hopes is a fresh, non-obvious twist. Image set (concrete, crystal, shell, crown) is specific to this narrative and would fail if swapped. The conceptual leap—“end of the world is disconnection”—feels inevitable only at closure, yet is fully seeded by the shell-confession mechanism. Risk taken in merging hard-SF bunker realism with lyric mysticism succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
