<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena’s grief is sketched in stock phrases (“hollow and adrift,” “subdued ardor”) rather than embodied contradiction; she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The stencil and origami function as props, not pressure points. The promised arc from “withering to bloom” is asserted, not dramatized; the ending offers stasis, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure is a soft Charged Poise: origami glow in alcoves, implying ongoing service. Cost is conceptual—lifelong guardianship—but feels abstract because Elena never confronts a live decision inside the scene window. Causality is accumulative/textural: grief → observatory → craft → teaching, each step declared rather than tested. The drive lens holds, yet the tightening is narrated density, not a visible fork that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s star-paths, shifting architecture, and thin curtains create a textured micro-setting that does constrain access to the dead. Sensory detail is selective—star-whispers, vellum texture—but occasionally drifts into catalogue listings of alcoves. The final image of glowing origami reuses the setting’s light motif to crystallize Elena’s stance, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</question><comment>Stake—helping others grieve—is declared early but never tightened by an on-page test or trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; Elena simply continues her ritual. Cost is existential, not dramatized. Pressure remains flat; the story accumulates examples rather than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Theme of transformed grief emerges through recurring phoenix-and-ashes imagery folded into jewelry and origami, avoiding explicit thesis. The final image reframes prior motifs (light, paper, coordinates) into quiet endurance. Subtext is present but leans on abstract “teaching withering to bloom” rather than a specific realized irony. Complexity is acknowledged yet not fully plumbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Lyrical, elevated diction (“curtains of intention shimmered between worlds”) is consistent and atmospheric, though at risk of register drift. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is absent. Perceptual signature is observatory-centric—starlit, cosmic—rather than individuated to Elena’s bodily grief. Repetitive anaphora (“Every night…”) creates template cadence that flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Strong rhythmic control in opening paragraph; later sentences sprawl with stacked participles that slacken momentum. Metaphors occasionally mix (“curtains of intention” beside “rock bottom”) without pattern payoff. No paraphrase loops, but several near-duplicate clauses (“grief consumed her entirely, leaving her hollow and adrift”). Closure line is clean and resonant, avoiding artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Interdimensional observatory as grief sanctuary is fresh, yet the beats—celestial gateway, origami keys, phoenix stencil—feel like curated fantastical tropes rather than a single transformative angle. Risk is present but safe; the story never jeopardizes its tender tone. Synthesis is atmospheric, not seismic; swap “origami” for “lantern” and logic holds, indicating moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
