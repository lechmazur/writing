<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-archaeologist persona is vivid, but her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) are asserted rather than enacted in scene; the epiphany is soft-revealed through reflective summary instead of a pressured micro-choice, so the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. “Quietly analytic” recurs as label, not demonstrated tactic under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow-globe image reweights her life-rule from hoarding to releasing, with “Peace” as audible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterned returns of ‘tangle / untangle’ and ‘snow-settle’ deepen stake rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by line 4; transitions are handled within one continuous descent-ascent window; no meaningful escalation break, only a single cadence shift, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sunken-library micro-setting is tactile—aqueous pages swollen like tumors, captain’s desk fissure—and directly supplies the hidden drawer / globe that catalyzes the final reweighting. POV-filtered sensory triage (pressure gauges, silt breath) keeps detail purposive; environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as she enters, lifts, writes, ascends; no anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep or release the ghosts?”—is signaled early; pressure mounts through accretive imagery (swollen books, fused pages) rather than new external obstacles. One meaningful tightening: shaking the globe = decision to leave her own note, foreclosing the artifact-hoard path. Cost is legible but generalized (“lightness”); lacks a concrete forfeiture on-page, keeping it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-buoyancy emerges via concrete objects (globe, vellum note) and recursive water imagery, never sermonizes. Final image reconfigures premise: letting go = integration, not loss. Subtextual irony—she salvages to learn why salvage fails—remains implicit, inviting reread. Sophisticated melancholy saturates diction yet avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s analytical perceptual signature (“quietly analytic mind observed shifting water pressures”). Syntax grows clipped under depth pressure, then lengthens on ascent—rhythmic modulation is purposeful. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated; diction remains within plausible lexicon of technically trained diver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean, high-density, with selective metaphors (“shelves stood like skeletons”). A few template cadence runs—“She… She… As she…”—appear mid-page, not in closure beat, causing minor drag. No mixed metaphors or purple overwrite; sentences advance at least two jobs (image + interiority). Final paragraph trims to crystalline image, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Combines maritime-archaeology salvage with metaphysical library is fresh; snow globe as key to surrender trope is non-obvious. Premise transformation: Earhart cameo reframes famous disappearance as deliberate release rather than tragedy, feeding Elara’s arc. Emotional specificity outweighs surface novelty; voice-level melancholy keeps it from feeling like concept exercise. Risk stays moderate—structure linear, no formal acrobatics—hence not 8+.</comment>
