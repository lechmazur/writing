<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “creeping-normality” gift is shown through concrete sensory vigilance (bay inches, oak slowing), giving her a sharp perceptual signature. The orris-root placement is a micro-choice that visibly costs her childhood certainty, cementing her motivation. Interiority avoids diagnostic jargon, instead using tactile memory (“scent of violets and memory”). Still, the moment of realization feels slightly paraphrased rather than embodied, and no secondary character is present to test status dynamics, holding this short of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is legible: orris-root displacement → tangible quiet → cottage sigh → theory confirmed. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara sees a pattern that reweights every future act, with the cottage’s warmth as felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 3. The lens stays Accumulative/Textural; one meaningful cadence shift suffices. A micro-drag is the summary-like “she realized…” rather than dramatized confirmation; that keeps it below 8.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Bay, cobblestones, cherry petals, salt air are filtered through Elara’s slow-change lens, giving micro-setting purpose. The orris root itself functions as environment-in-hand, constraining the final move. Spatial choreography is tight: gate latch, creaking beams, interior dust all track cleanly. Weather and season mirror the theme of gentle resurgence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—why houses live or die—pressures every beat; the cottage’s breath provides the tightening. Agency is present: her deliberate displacement triggers the shift. Cost is visible in the hush that wraps her and the cottage’s audible relief. No reversal beyond the single profound inhale, but that suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern-recognition rather than thesis: small displacements sanctify. The final image of “quiet fire of purpose” reweights prior streetlight motif without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—root on rusty latch, not explanation. A trace of thematic echo (“inadvertently profound”) is uttered once, but not in final paragraph, so penalty is minor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic bias; perceptual signature is consistent (“streetlights daydream”). Filter verbs are minimal; syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens at the inhale. No dialogue to test, so no penalty. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction nudges academic; else voice remains within coastal artisan diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, layered, and loop-free; opening anchors voice and stakes in two lines. Metaphors stay coherent (“pink snow” fits cherry petals). No scaffold or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or knowledge. Rhythm modulates with the hush beat, giving natural propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “displaced object as sanctifier” premise feels fresh against haunted-house tropes. Specificity—orris root fixing scent and spirit—grounds the concept. A slight echo of commonplace “objects hold memory” keeps it from 9+. Final reconfiguration is inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
