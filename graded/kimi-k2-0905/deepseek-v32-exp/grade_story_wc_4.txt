<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-perceptive lens is consistent, but her interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“transmute pain into a masterpiece”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. No visible cost attaches to her choices; she lingers, arranges, listens, but nothing is foreclosed. Mr. Hemlock’s grief is the only beat that pressures her stance, yet she remains a passive conduit, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty map-case beside her in the lavender field reweights the whole project into “peace,” a legible social cost. Causality, however, is loose—exhibition success and communal healing arrive off-stage, summarized rather than shown. The ‘because’ chain is mostly “she displayed photos → townspeople felt better,” which feels accumulative/textural rather than driven by her decisive agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lavender vs. rust dichotomy is vivid and purposeful, filtering every beat through scent, color, and decay. The dove-gray map case functions as micro-setting; its final emptiness charges the ending. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies move credibly across field and hall. Detail economy is strong—no wasteful cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can photographs heal?”—is signaled early but escalation is ambient: more visitors, more shared tears, no obstacle or trade-off. No reversal narrows Elara’s options; pressure accumulates rather than tightens. Cost is social/observed, not personal, so tension plateaus rather than peaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Healing-through-art theme emerges organically via recurring arcs of photos and the living reclamation of vines. The moral complexity is present—art profits from others’ pain—but left implicit, inviting reflection. Final image of the empty case avoids thesis-statement trap and lets the theme resonate through object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice sustains a gentle, lyrical compression with patterned clauses (“as vines climbed…”) that teach the accretive rhythm early. Diction stays within Elara’s perceptual register; no corporate register drift. Free-indirect slips are clean; no head-hopping. Slight lift into poetic cadence at closure is earned and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies well; sentence openings rotate. Occasional soft fillers—“she chose to linger here,” “in that moment, everything made sense”—slow propulsion without breaking it. No mixed metaphors or over-modification. Scaffold is minimal; only minor paraphrase loops near the reflective coda.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist heals town” frame is refreshed by lavender-vs-ruins sensory counterpoint and the map-case object arc. Black-and-white arcs concept is evocative but not fully exploited as constraint. Risk level is moderate; stakes stay safe, healing certain. Specificity of scent and tactile detail keeps it from feeling template-cut.</comment>
