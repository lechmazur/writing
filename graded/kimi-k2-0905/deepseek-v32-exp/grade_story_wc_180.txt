<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s feisty stubbornness is shown through her solitary cathedral labor and the micro-choice to craft “eyes that see hidden truths,” but the interiority drifts toward paraphrase (“she realized…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The mother–daughter rift is sketched more in summary than in scene, so the final embrace feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than hard-won. Still, her persistence tracks cleanly from exile to altar offering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine—exile → retrieve bag → craft gift → reunion—holds, and the hair-ribbon return supplies visible closure cost. Transitions are smooth, but the orchard-as-setting is introduced late (after retrieval) and the “deciduous vows” epiphany is narrated rather than dramatized, blunting the decisive change. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is sensory and specific, roots in beams guiding Elara’s climb and echoing the theme of growth from decay. Apple scent and rotting stone constrain her mood and later frame the dawn reunion, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors remain steady; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the rift with Lyra—is signaled early and tightens when Elara ties the ribbon around her wrist while polishing quartz eyes. Escalation is single-cycle, but agency is visible: she chooses to “persist” through trial, and the offering on the altar forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (pride shed) rather than visceral, yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Deciduous vows” emerges organically from mother’s journal and re-weights the ending when Lyra repeats the phrase, achieving resonance without sermon. The orchard’s seasonal cycle mirrors the concept, avoiding abstract thesis. No final-paragraph moralizing; the image of retied ribbon supplies the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Elara’s feisty, craftsman perception; diction like “quartz-eye mender,” “divine decay,” and “sap through the trees” is textured and character-bound. No dialogue, so voice convergence not tested. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short clauses under pressure, longer cadence for reflection—without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + image) and avoid loops; “bloom of apples and decay of stone” compresses scent and theme in one stroke. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous vows,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Elara’s craft-philosophy lens. Zero grammar slips; prop states (ribbon, quartz shards) tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orchard is a fresh spatial paradox that literally supports the plot (beams as soil). The deciduous-vow metaphor reframes generational conflict without feeling grafted; risk lies in quiet reunion rather than spectacle, and it pays off. Could swap “quartz-eye” for another craft, so not fully irreplicable, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
