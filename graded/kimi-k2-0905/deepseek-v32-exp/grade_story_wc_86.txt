<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers worrying the drawer pull, the chest-tight memory—but the “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive is stated more than dramatized; the final lightness feels more declared than cost-earned, softening the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal through-line holds: the drawer pull surfaces early, picks up symbolic freight, and re-appears in the handshake beat, re-weighting choice. The handshake itself is a light closure; cost is present but diffuse (Kael’s admitted loss, Elara’s guilt let go), keeping it short of 9-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Storm-worn parapet and clinging mist are filtered through Elara’s skin and mission priorities; the pull’s metallic cold and stone surface act as micro-setting that guides her gesture and finally charges the handshake image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the two-character pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can these enemies risk a new protocol—surfaces early and tightens once: Kael’s admission of fratricide narrows options to cooperation or endless vendetta. The handshake forecloses revenge path; cost (Kael’s grief, Elara’s guilt-release) is legible but not viscerally acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciliation cycles emerges from the drawer pull’s re-weighting and moon-phase timing rather than exposition; the final “recycle mistakes into wisdom” line leans overt, slightly blunting resonance, yet the image of shared cold metal lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight keeps perceptual signature aligned with Elara’s tactical watchfulness; wind, metal, mist are noticed through negotiator’s risk-filter. Syntax stays controlled; no head-hop; Kael’s voice distinct only in single rough admission—sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with variable rhythm; sentences open with changing shapes; no loops or filter stacks; figurative phrases (“mist clinging like a shroud,” “furrowed hush”) are sparse, pattern-taught, paid off in final soft wind. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Negotiator using moon-phase calendar and a household drawer pull as peace token offers fresh inflection on familiar prisoner-swap scene; premise remains recognizable, but specificity of object and timing ritual lifts it above template. Emotional risk is moderate rather than daring.</comment>
