<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—preservation oath vs. truth-telling—are dramatized in one continuous scene; the trembling hand on the icy terminal embodies the cost. Interiority stays concrete (“memories of vanished archivists”) rather than diagnostic. The final step away from the terminal is a credible renunciation that forecloses her former life, cost legible in the hush that now “held a promise of dawn.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she receives the letter, therefore she uploads; because she uploads, the network stirs and the council is scandalized. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“echoing library under snow”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the seed is planted, the conversation begun, cost felt in the “refreshing, cleansing” cold that now frames her exile. One micro-turn—alarm expected, instead a soft chime—tightens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library-as-server, the frost on the terminal, the breath-mist are selective, pressure-filtered details that constrain finger movement and data flow. Snow and silence evolve from decorative to tactical: the hush that once oppressed becomes the carrier wave for whispers of change. Micro-setting (data chip, icy controls) directly enables the upload beat. Final image of drifting snow reweights the setting from tomb to cradle of quiet revolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: expected alarms become soft chime, narrowing her fate from arrest to silent solidarity. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits institutional protection and embraces fugitive status. Agency is present (she inserts, initiates, walks away); escalation is causal under lens, not spectacular but sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogan: cryogenic preservation of data mirrors frozen conscience; thawing one thaws the other. Subtext in the soft chime—system acknowledges rather than alerts—renders tyranny both omniscient and oddly complicit. Final image of snow as hushed promise resists moralizing; it reconfigures silence from oppression to germination. No echoes of prompt language; concept stays embodied in archive, chip, whiteness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close adheres to Elara’s perceptual hierarchy—cold, silence, vanishing risk—without head-hop. Diction (“cryogenic archivist,” “contraband truths”) stays within her professional lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“blink that follows surprise”) then lengthens into cadence of resolve. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative voice; its frost-pattern repetitions (“dizzying quiet”) are taught early and payoff at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“She inserted the letter's data chip, feeling the hum of awakening systems”). Metaphors are spare and coherent—library as circulatory system—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the quiet growing more dizzying” repeats the opening epithet; since pattern is taught and echoed at closure, penalty is hairline. No loops impair causality or final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen-archive-as-revolutionary-node is a fresh synthesis; trope of whistle-blower is re-cast through cryogenic metadata. Specificity of dormant servers buriedinside a snow-muffled library gives the premise bite. Risk—quiet upload instead of explosive leak—pays off in the soft-chime inversion. Could edge higher if the genocide data carried a single sensory shard to freeze the abstraction.</comment>
