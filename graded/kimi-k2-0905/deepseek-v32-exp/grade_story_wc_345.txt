<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s calloused fingers on chalk and her dawn rally show embodied leadership, but the cast swells to three without distinct interior contradiction; the ghost’s altruism is asserted, never tested by a counter-impulse, so motive change feels gentle rather than costly. Micro-choices (Jax’s kick, Kael’s resonance leap) are present yet compressed; still, the relational crucible is thin because the ghost never risks failure or rejection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: chalk → bell → nebula → bloom; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“The garden grows”) that reweights hope from bramble to vine. The Orientation Test is waived—floating-arch weirdness is taught by 5% mark and pays off in the glowing mineral pulse—so no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt spikes at “we’re following a ghost based on sidewalk scribbles,” forcing Elara’s dawn recommitment; cost is the irreversible energy spend and the ghost’s own disappearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches function as both geography and resonant amplifier; their mineral veins literally constrain the final tactic. The bell-as-blossom object and butterfly cocoon provide micro-setting anchors that charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (chime) and light (nebula) over visual catalog, fitting crisis-narrowed perception. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from derelict garden to highest arch without impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the grove—signals early; doubt scene provides the single required tightening that forecloses the “quit” option. Energy drain as visible price (Jax’s kicked dust, Elara’s cracked voice) alters later tactics, keeping pressure causal under the Causal lens. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 750-word scale; nebula reveal is earned resonance, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges via reframed hope: bramble → vine, ghost → soil. The bell’s reprise and the butterfly’s emergence reweight “respite” without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the ghost’s absence in final line is the loudest statement. Minor softness: “brambled hope” is named once near opening and never returned to with new inflection, blunting full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice sustains rhythmic control; patterned diction (“floating rock arches… petrified trees”) teaches its cadence early. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature skews toward geologic and sonic detail. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Jax’s mechanic grumble vs. Kael’s botanical leap. No head-hopping; ghost POV remains externalized light, consistent with rules.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. High information density: single sentences fold setting, emotion, and stakes (“Their hope was a brambled thing…”). One paraphrase loop (“the words were simple, yet strangely trustworthy… trustworthy” in adjacent clauses) clipped −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Prose propels without scaffold; final line is image-driven, not explained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of ghost-mentor + orchard exoplanet + musical geology feels fresh; trope matrix is transformed through concrete botanic-mechanic collaboration. Risk: quiet lyrical ending rather than spectacle, but coherence holds. Specificity of inverted-blossom bell and mineral-vein arches anchors memory. Could swap “nebula of respite” for generic miracle, so not quite 8.5.</comment>
