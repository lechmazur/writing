<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s transformation from arsonist to keeper is credibly anchored in tactile flashback and present mending; the “volcanic tenderness” idiom is over-toured and the internal ledger of guilt stays abstract, never quite embodied in a single micro-choice that costs him on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain—tapestry fragment → curator trail → chamber discovery → promise rescue—tightens neatly; the vandalized portrait map is a sharp pivot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (knowledge must circulate) with felt cost, but the “six months off-grid” anchor arrives late (~140 words) and the Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies because the disorientation never pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dust-laden corridors and slashed canvas are selective, pressure-filtered details; the tapestry itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final act of mending. Sensory hierarchy stays narrow (cold, dust, light shaft) and supports the hush of archive-as-crucible, though spatial choreography is lightly sketched rather than stress-tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—liberate the promise—escalates because each artwork forecloses wrong paths; portrait-as-map is the tightening beat that makes the hidden chamber the only live option. Cost is visible: the curator erased self, Kaelen erases his old arson identity; the price is conceptual but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge hoarding vs. communal fire; no final moralizing. The promise reweights the meaning of both arson and archive without tidy binaries, though the “volcanic tenderness” refrain edges toward thematic echo (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited interiority is consistent, with perceptual signature in Kaelen’s symbol-reading gaze. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Register stays within a scavenger-scholar lexicon; only the repeated “volcanic tenderness” nudges template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level rhythm breathes with scene pressure; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned (tapestry-as-map, seedling-as-hope) and stays coherent. One scaffold stem (“volcanic tenderness” ×3) is a minor artifact (−0.2) but does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist turned conservator of burnt knowledge; curator’s self-erasure as map. The trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail (seedling sketch, sharing-meal carving) grounds novelty.</comment>
