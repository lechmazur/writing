<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—engineer’s precision vs. dream-archeologist hunger—stay live in every mirror-tilt, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“synaptic plasticity”) that flattens embodied cost. The final stance crystallizes with visible price: she forfeits her prior self-narrative, but the turn is rushed inside one clause, blunting the ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each refracted color layers density rather than causal chain, tightening until the canyon walls sing with borrowed dreams. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara stands as living archive—whose conceptual cost (she now carries orphaned hopes) lands cleanly on the final image. One scaffold loop (“chaotically precise gestures” repeated) slightly dulls the cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon, broken mirror, and Elara’s own body form a single micro-setting that actively refracts choice; the cracked glass literally re-angles what memories can enter. Sensory hierarchy is tight—visual spectrum, cold stone, bone quake—mirroring internal states without overt symbolic nudging. The mirror’s final silent state recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she hold multitudes without fracturing?—tightens when each spectral memory exacts a synaptic tax, foreclosing the option of ordinary identity. Escalation is textural: color-density mounts until flying-child memory tips her into irrevocable fusion. Cost is legible (“her very bones quaked”), though the canyon’s responsive vibration edges on convenient intensifier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of curating lost futures: every borrowed dream displaces a piece of the borrower. Subtext lives in mirror-fractures—what reflects also distorts—without authorial commentary. Final image reweights the premise: the archive is now animate, walking at dawn, a resonant non-moral answer to the cost of resurrection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: helix-minded spirals, engineer-calculated angles, poet’s chromatic yearning all filter through the same syntax. Rhythm modulates—long breathless accumulations tighten into staccato tilts under lunar glare. No head-hopping; compression (“chaotically precise”) is taught early and paid off in mirror choreography.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong density—each sentence carries mirror, light, memory, and body—but two adjacent “chaotically precise” phrases create synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“spiraling coils that loop back”) momentarily violates physical logic. Otherwise propulsive, with vivid nouns and muscular verbs; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synaptic-plasticity-meets-collective-dream-archeology, grounded in tactile mirror-work rather than concept alone. Risk of lyric overload is answered by disciplined sensory economy. Flying-child memory reprised at dawn feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick, because the mirror’s spectrum taught the pattern early.</comment>
