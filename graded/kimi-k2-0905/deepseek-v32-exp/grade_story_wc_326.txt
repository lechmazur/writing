<comment>Elara’s heartbeat-counting compulsion is embodied early and drops away at closure, showing earned change; the porcelain shard reappears twice, its final placement capping her arc with visible cost. Interior contradiction is thin—she never actively fights the urge to count while defragmenting, so the micro-choice feels pre-ordained rather than pressured. The digital ghost supplies pressure but is an external prompt, not a relationship crucible, so status shifts are off-stage. Still, the counting quirk, memory-blame, and shard form a tight triad that individuates her and drives the final renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: she stops counting, drawer-shuts the shard, and the observatory brightens—an Earned Stasis with felt cost under Accumulative lens (ink patterns re-weight meaning). Causality inside the defragment sequence is montage-style memory, not because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“ephemeral patterns in spilled ink”) and pays off in the final image, so lens holds. Radio-static anchor appears ~word 60 and pays off at end, satisfying Orientation Test. One minor slack: the system error that listed her dead is asserted, never shown or re-encountered, so the external stakes feel inherited rather than re-proven on page.</comment>

<comment>Opal dome, snow, and ink pool function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics: only the ink surface can organise data, and the ice-quiet allows the ritual. Shard temperature, ink shimmer, and dome glow are tactile and POV-filtered; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—shard moves from floor → hand → drawer, anchoring the arc. Weather (falling snow) returns in the last paragraph to reinforce stillness, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“fetch wisdom from failure”—is signaled early; the defragment act tightens by forcing her to relive ignoring Kael’s warning, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is conceptual (guilt acknowledged) rather than tactical; no resource loss alters later moves, so pressure intensifies emotionally but not materially. Escalation is accumulative: ink images layer until reckoning; one decisive deepening suffices. Ghost prompts but does not raise external danger, so antagonistic pressure is internal only, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—wisdom through confronting failure—emerges from ink-sequence images, not declaration; final line offers quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext resides in shard (breakage → integration) and heartbeat (life → acceptance); no thematic echo sentences. Ambiguity remains: we are not told whether system error will ever be corrected, letting theme linger. Porcelain and counting motifs recur with shifted meaning, earning their keep.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, close to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“milky, shifting luminescence,” “searing light followed by utter silence”—is poetic yet consistent with astronomer POV. Rhythm lengthens in calm passages, fragments slightly under memory-flash pressure, mirroring emotional cadence. Dialogue is minimal (ghost whisper) and appropriately stylised; no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and varied: sentences open with changing structures, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective (“ink…shimmering” mirrors opal dome) and does not overcrowd peak beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “opal” and “snow” recur only when recharging image. One mixed metaphor—“internal fires reflecting clarity”—is minor, does not touch closure, so stays above 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of data-defragmentation ritual with ink scrying feels fresh; ties astronaut-error trauma to personal memory repair. Porcelain shard as physical cursor of reconciliation is specific, not generic symbol. Concept risks cliché (digital ghost) but is saved by ephemeral-light visual and limited screen-time. Ending quietude rather than external repair avoids sentimental redemption, keeping complexity. Not quite transformative—core grief-recovery arc is familiar—but angle and object use supply memorable inflection.</comment>
