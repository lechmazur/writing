<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s longing to “learn the language of old buildings” is vivid and embodied; the obedient suspension of disbelief about Finch’s ghostliness feels character-specific. Yet Finch himself remains a graceful cipher—his only interior contradiction is the wistful smile—and the narrator’s micro-choices never sharpen into a painful trade-off, so the promised “cost” of the final transfer of the seal is inferred rather than dramatized. The relationship does function as crucible, but the shift is sentimental, not tactical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the brass seal passes from ghost to living keeper, a conceptual repricing that permanently reframes the city as text. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each meteor-steeped tea layers the lexicon until the final silence can speak. The orientation waiver is earned—deliberate disorientation (transparent hand, celestial dissolve) pays off in the last image. One soft spot: the narrator’s decision to accept the mantle is summarized in a single clause; the beat is present but not pressured, so the cost is felt atmospherically, not tactically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, meteor shower, and brass seal are rendered with synesthetic economy; jasmine scent and “iron bones” anchor the body-as-building metaphor. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible reaches or drifting props. The seal’s weight and warmth are re-registered each time it changes hands, so the object literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor lapse: city architecture is evoked in lyric abstractions (“mortar veins”) rather than one concrete detail that could constrain a later choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—gaining fluency in architectural utterance—tightens through each wax impression and creak translation; the final silence after Finch’s dissolution is the undeniable price. Escalation is textural: density of meteors and remembered sigils accumulates rather than reverses. One meaningful shift occurs when the narrator realizes the conversation will continue without the tutor, foreclosing the option of external guidance. Cost is atmospheric, not logistical; the story could have reached 8.8+ had the seal’s transfer forced an immediate tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: translation as collaboration with the dead, architecture as palimpsest of shared lies. Subtext lives in gesture—Finch pouring tea through translucent fingers—never thesis. Final silence reweights “agreed-upon lies” from polite pretense to ontological necessity, avoiding explicit moral. The almost-love between living student and ghost tutor complicates the theme with unspoken eros, giving the reader a visceral aftertaste beyond conceptual neatness.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice is consistent, lyrically compressed, and meteor-paced; no head-hopping or register drift. Perceptual signature—“celestial fireworks,” “wind through an alley”—is idiosyncratic yet restrained. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext (the single direct question hangs like jasmine). One filter-verb cluster (“I soon realized…”) is minor; rhythm breathes naturally, and the final cadence crystallizes into hush without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is highly controlled: metaphor vehicles stay physical (wax, iron, jasmine) and never collide; no mixed-metaphor muddle. Density is high—each sentence does two jobs (atmosphere + character or causality). Two adjacent “I”-openings could have been varied, but the pattern is brief and does not stall propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; closing sentence lands with imagistic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost philologist of buildings—feels inevitable yet fresh; trope is inverted by making the city the text rather than the haunting. Specificity of brass seal pressed into warm wax rescues concept from abstract whimsy. Risky choice to let mentor evaporate into starlight is earned by prior pattern; no safety-moral restores Finch to life. Final infusion of silence is a non-obvious reconfiguration that would collapse if replaced with generic parting.</comment>
