<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“the hollow replica discovered in the woods had shattered that illusion”—but the emotional arc is told more than embodied. The decisive turn relies on a declarative mantra (“Everything is a story waiting to be rewritten”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her something visible. Skepticism and forgiveness are asserted, not dramatized in a single irreversible action. The earned shift feels conceptual, not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the dissolving tooth reweights reality, cost felt as luminous clarity. Causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore; lens is Accumulative/Textural. The orientation anchor (“After the substitute body was found”) is prompt-cued and late, but disorientation is waived because the garden’s breath-magic pays it off. One slight causality wobble: the grandmother’s bone-setting never constrains present tactics, appears only as late metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The secret garden and hedge maze function as micro-setting: living walls whisper, plants twist into new forms under her hands—environment that literally reshapes in response to her ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her kneel, press, stand. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and touch, mirroring internal shift. The tooth-as-tool charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—healing the rift between worlds—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative imagery: tooth glow, garden breathes, fireflies constellation. No visible price is exacted from Elara; the cost is atmospheric, not tactical. The tightening is poetic, not option-narrowing, keeping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as innovation, mistakes as stars. No explicit thesis; final image reweights premise without moralizing. The motif of “constellations” recurs with shifted meaning, tying interior arc to cosmology. Complexity is present—changeling as guide, not thief—yet ambiguity stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up maintains steady psychic distance. Syntax is rhythmically controlled—“She yearned no longer for what was lost, but for the possibilities”—modulating with emotional crest. Perceptual signature is biased toward synesthetic magic: air shimmer, garden breathes. No dialogue to contaminate voice; diction stays within plausible rural-fae lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but avoids purple overload; metaphors are consistent (constellation, bone, garden). One paraphrase loop—“a shrine to her misplaced trust… the cleft in her certainty had widened into a chasm”—drops it from 8.0. Sentence rhythm varies; no filter-verb stacks. Closing line lands cleanly without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar changeling lore is refreshed by maternal grief reframed as cosmological bone-setting. The innovation—using folk bone-mending on reality itself—feels specific to this voice. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot, but coherence holds. Proximity to “stolen child” trope is acknowledged yet transformed through forgiveness lens.</comment>
