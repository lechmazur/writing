<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s involuntary truth-telling is dramatized early and shapes the inciting exchange; her micro-choice to chant the riddle while Kael sprays the rods embodies her “wonder in routine” motive. Yet the interiority lapses into lofty abstractions (“light sleeps in storm’s trance”) that feel authored, not lived, and Kael remains a functional helper rather than a status antagonist, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is legible: blackout → riddle → condensation insight → reboot. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—tower restored, wonder reframed—but the cost is communal, not personal; Elara forfeits nothing tangible, so the “felt” bar is only barely cleared. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment> Lightning rods, lacquer box, and nectar-dusk sky are sensuously etched and return in the final image; the tower’s metallic spine and rain-slick rungs constrain the climbing action. Selective detail favors the visual; scent of rain-honey arrives only at the tag, narrowing sensorial range. World rules stay consistent: drones reboot only when wet, no cheat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore city power—signals early; pressure tightens when the riddle is literalized into condensation tactic. Protagonist agency is present but shared with Kael; the visible price is off-loaded to the city, not Elara, so escalation feels medium. One meaningful turn suffices at this length, yet stakes never threaten Elara’s private wonder, muting personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder hidden inside routine emerges through iterative image of tower maintenance and riddle-as-mantra, never sermonized. Final lacquer-box click reweights earlier motif, but thematic cargo is lightweight—no counter-reading or moral friction. Subtext stays literal; silence and gesture underused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature shows in “nectar-dusk” coinages and tower-as-body metaphors. Syntax remains steady, but cadence does not modulate under pressure; diction edges toward poetic generic (“amber and violet”) rather than idiosyncratic. Dialogue sparse and utilitarian, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, high density; no scaffold or synonym churn. Occasional soft fillers—“the city lay silent and dark” opens with familiar palette; “wonder felt fragile, like a dream” is stock simile. Peak beat at summit avoids overwritten figurative pile-up, maintaining clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing bee drone navigation with lightning-rod condensation is fresh; riddle-as-tech-manual offers a neat conceptual flip. Yet the blackout-to-reboot arc is standard save-the-city fare, and character stakes stay generic. Specificity of tower-tending ritual helps, but story hedges the risk of letting wonder actually cost Elara something irreversible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Her candidness triggers the key exposition beats and final chant; removing it collapses the causal funnel.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Box appears first paragraph, intermediates the riddle transfer, and closes the story with a charged click that reweights its emptiness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Drone failure drives blackout stakes; wet-sensor dance failure is literalized at climax; cannot be swapped out.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Truth compulsion surfaces in whispered exposition and the forced riddle share; shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Revealing the riddle aloud is the pivot that lets Kael decode condensation; removal stalls plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Matchbox riddle is the only path to solution; its worn cardboard signals age, its text delivers the tactical insight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Tower provides vertical set, tool access, and condensation surface; geography of rods and hive directly enables fix.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Blackout supplies urgent clock; time passage tracked by climb and reboot flicker, though no tightening deadline beyond “city dark.”</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Wonder motto voiced early and reprised at end; Elara’s smile at restored lights shows motive paid, but no private sacrifice deepens cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Nectar-dusk” recurs as color and emotional hue; final fade to night keeps tone coherent and charges last image.</comment>
