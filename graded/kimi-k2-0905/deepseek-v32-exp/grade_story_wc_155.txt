<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but interiority slips into label-speak (“pensive mirth”) and generic therapy-speak (“the joy was not lost, merely waiting”). Only one embodied micro-choice—placing the fragment—drives change; the rest is observation. No contradictory impulse under pressure; emotional arc is tidy rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s ghostly bloom reconfigures the fog’s meaning and carries conceptual cost—she must keep working inside ruin. Causal chain is loose; the fragment “reacts” by unexplained optics, network input is told not shown, and the prism/algae lack set-up, so the lens wobbles between Causal and Accumulative. Still, the final image reweights prior decay and gives undeniable before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory selection stays urgent—damp walls, porous clay, glow of algae—filtered through painterly perception. The skeletal apple tree and fresco fragment serve as micro-setting that guides her next action. Spatial cues hold; fog density and temperature affect visibility and emotional temperature. Environment constrains choice and charges the final projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. One meaningful intensification: the fragment projects a living orchard, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (she accepts perpetual labor inside ruin) but not viscerally felt on page. Agency is present—she steers light—but escalation is mostly lyrical accumulation, not causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: memory as active, collaborative preservation rather than escape. No explicit moral; final image of fog-as-canvas reweights earlier despair. Subtext resides in gesture—cupping the fragile shard, laughing alone—avoiding overt thesis. Ambiguity is controlled; counter-reading (is illusion enough?) is plausible but not confused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains painterly perceptual signature—color as luminescence, fog as blank wall. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for reverie, short pulses for discovery. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction creeps into emotional peaks but stays marginal. No dialogue; avoids voice convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong image density but figurative runs stack in climactic beats (“ghostly orchard…dappled shade…phantom bloom”) without taught pattern, costing immediacy. Occasional scaffold: “the joy she sought was not… / the joy was not lost…” paraphrases within three lines. Pronoun and tense clean; spatial sequencing accurate. Final line earns keep—recharges fog/canvas motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresco-as-exposed-film metaphor freshens standard post-apocalyptic memory-trove. Combining algae optics with hidden artisan network feels idiosyncratic and specific to painter POV. Risk is moderate—lyric ghost-orchard could feel familiar—but detail (porous clay, prism angle) grounds it. Transformation test passes: swap fresco for photo and whole optic scheme collapses.</comment>
