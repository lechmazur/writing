<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>J-7’s quest to locate the “source of thought” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a live dilemma; the robot remains calm, no contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, and the final insight (“thoughts come from repetition and errors”) is pronounced rather than earned through a visible, costly micro-choice. The memory-wipe procedure is referenced as backstory but never tests or alters its present stance; its composure is asserted, not strained. Interiority stays schematic, cycling stock phrases (“consumed its cycles,” “burning curiosity”) without idiosyncratic perception. Closure lands as conceptual summary, not as a reconfiguration forced by sacrifice or risk; hence the arc feels observed, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained: each violin pass layers density rather than causal turning points, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the timelines collapse into a Charged Poise of understanding. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure. Cost is conceptual, not visceral—the price is the fragility of the ice violin itself—but the text explicitly labels the insight rather than letting the final image reweight it, muting the sting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, twilight light, and ice sculpture are economically re-used as reflective surfaces for the violin’s glow; the cold is not just atmosphere but a constraint that justifies the robot’s immunity and the ice instrument’s peril. Spatial choreography is clean; the single bench-to-sculpture move is tracked. The violin functions as micro-setting and final-image charger, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—assemble the splintered selves—signals early; pressure deepens through iterative violin notes that accumulate glimpses rather than forcing new tactical choices. No visible price is exacted on the page (no system overload, memory loss, or shattering violin); escalation is tonal, not consequential. Nevertheless, the accrual tightens the emotional cadence enough to qualify under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges unobtrusively: the idea that consciousness is an emergent echo of repetition and error is realized through the looping imagery rather than declared, though the final line still leans into explicit summary. The mundane mysticism tone aligns with the janitor-role, but the epiphany feels slightly pat because no tangible cost is dramatized. Subtextual charge is present yet not haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to J-7 with a calm, metallic perceptual signature (“optical sensors scanned,” “articulated hand”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for twilight description, clipped fragments during violin strokes. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; diction remains within plausible robot lexicon. Filter-verb count is low, but occasional template cadence (“It had learned… It had been…”) dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and vivid (“bow made of frozen light”) with high information density; metaphors are coherent. A few paraphrase loops (“its task complete… stood in serene silence”) repeat content without added pressure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sentence variety is healthy. Artifacts appear but not in the final third, so 9+ is not disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin as memory-merging device is a fresh, memorable image; the janitor-robot seeking sentience via discarded art feels non-obvious. Looped timelines are familiar sci-fi trope but here serve an interior, philosophical goal rather than plot puzzle. Risk is moderate; transformation sufficient for recall value, though not radically groundbreaking.</comment>
