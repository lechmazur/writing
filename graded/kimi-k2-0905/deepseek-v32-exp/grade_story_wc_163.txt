<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—her fingers on the brittle feather, the pocket-warmth at the end—but motivation stays abstract (“rhythm of belonging” is repeated, not tested). No contradictory impulse in scene; she drifts from observation to observation without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The single significant change is the realization that belonging is relational, but it is narrated as uplift, not wrested from a renounced alternative. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and occupation-specific, keeping the score in the solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sunrise-lit city and warmed feather re-weight the premise with felt cost (she leaves the sunken world she briefly claimed). Causal chain is light—bioluminescence arrives as gift, not consequence—but the accumulative pattern (star maps → feather → firefly echo) justifies the lens. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored within 50 words. The only slack is the 30-year-backstory datapad dump mid-scene; it pauses momentum without altering present tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Underwater city, curved-glass control room, and black water canvas are sketched with economy; the feather and holographic star projections function as micro-setting that constrains her attention. Bioluminescent bloom is timed to emotional crest, charging the final image. No spatial drift; generator hum and metal creak keep the facility alive. Sensory palette is narrow (mostly visual) but selective, matching her astronomer bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a sign of light/life—stays legible; the “until sunrise” clock is announced but never tightens tactics. Pressure escalates only by accumulation (darkness → star maps → glow), not because her options narrow. No reversal or trade-off; she watches rather than acts. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, capping the score at 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-rhythm emerges through recurrent light signals (fireflies, bioluminescence, sunrise) rather than thesis statements. Feather-as-phoenix is understated until the final warmth in her pocket, re-pricing failure into continuity. No moralizing close; last line leaves the reader with the dance metaphor. Ambiguity is preserved—she still has no literal home, only the pattern of shared breaths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—“softly ingenious methods,” “shadowseam wonder”—without register drift. Syntax mirrors stargazer precision: “holographic constellations projected onto the ocean floor.” No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction is consistent and textured. Only nit: “luminous respite” is used twice in summary mode, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for submerged calm, clipped fragments when she spots the swarm. No scaffolding loops; “burnt feather” returns only when meaning re-weights. Metaphors stay coherent (phoenix myth tied to actual warmth). Opening line could be sharper, but closing line earns its resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing landscape astrology with sunken-city bioluminescence feels fresh; the firefly echo across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is an original interpolation of the prompt. Feather-as-phoenix is familiar, but its burnt state is tied to a failed energy experiment, avoiding default symbolism. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation overplot—but coherence holds. Could edge higher if the experiment backstory had forced a tougher present choice.</comment>
