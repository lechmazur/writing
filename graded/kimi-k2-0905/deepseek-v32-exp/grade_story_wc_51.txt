<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is stated early and re-iterated, but her interiority stays at lyric summary (“boundary-lessly trapped”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. Emotions are named, not embodied—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The calcification ritual is repeated without escalating cost or error; she never risks failure, so the arc is flat. Love’s final lattice is pretty but unmotivated beyond the prompt’s mandate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each burden calcified adds artifact density; closure is a Charged Poise tableau of the golden lattice. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. However, the sequence is additive, not escalatory—no beat narrows options or raises price. The flame’s last “sigh” is the only faint cost image; calcification never backfires or limits her, so tension stays static.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight are vividly filtered through Elara’s artisan eye; the metallic walls “shimmering dance” refract her inner state. Sensory triangulation is tight—cold bronze floor, burner hiss, damp earth—anchoring each beat. Micro-setting (lamp height, flame flicker) directly guides her tightening ritual. No spatial drift; environment silently partners the weave, earning its closure glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—collect burdens—but no consequence attached if she fails or stops; pressure plateaus. Each burden calcified simply adds another pretty object without trade-off or mounting risk. No resource dwindles except off-screen kerosene; she never hesitates, mis-aligns, or fractures a crystal. Love lattice lands as aesthetic tableau, not narrowing options, so escalation is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing pain into art emerges through imagistic recurrence, not lecture. The fractal weave, shingled hush, and whalebone reverie form a coherent metaphor cluster: rigidity vs. flexibility. Yet the insight—burdens become beautiful artifacts—never complicates; no counter-reading questions the ethics of aestheticizing grief. Final image is satisfying but safe, unworried by the cost of possession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: metallic taste of starlight, baleen memory yielding. Syntax flexes from long sinuous sentences to shard-like fragments mirroring weave patterns. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under ritual focus. Diction occasionally over-leans on hyphenated abstractions (“boundary-lessly”) but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythm control: paragraph breath-pauses align with ritual beats; sentence openings vary. Occasional micro-loop—“weight of… weight of…” in adjacent burdens—dulls momentum. Mixed metaphors (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) stay coherent within lyric license. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractal-weaver alchemist is fresh, and the snowmelt-to-spring frame avoids typical renewal clichés by keeping the lens interior. Burdens-as-crystal-collection risks gamification, but the lyrical execution transcends inventory. Whalebone flex image repurposes marine biology into metaphysical insight. Could edge higher if calcification carried irreversible cost or public consequence.</comment>
