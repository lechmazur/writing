<comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete—“amber bottle felt heavy,” “closing his eyes to focus”—and his renunciation of nostalgia is embodied in micro-choices (salvaging wood, teaching settlers). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: he stations the unopened bottle in the square, foreclosing the wish-path forever. Missing only a second contradictory impulse in-scene to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bottle’s unopenable seal becomes the town’s new covenant, reweighting the rule-set from magic to merit. Causal linkage holds—each salvage/teach beat is a because/therefore consequence of the spent-wish premise. One scaffold loop (“rejected the false comfort” echoed twice) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Paper-lantern cove is signaled early, anchors every beat, and charges the final image: lanterns retrofitted as solar capacitors glow over workshops. Spatial choreography is tight—bench, square, gardens track cleanly. Setting constrains choice: wind/sea resources dictate the new engineering. Micro-setting (the bottle as town-square monument) fulfills 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—replace magic with sustainable labor—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each salvage/teach beat. One meaningful deepening: the bottle shifts from puzzle to civic charter, narrowing options (no more wishes). Cost is visible—years of patient rebuilding, laughter earned not granted. Slight repetition of “rejected false comfort” softens escalation peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the lamp-transformation image rather than thesis: solar lanterns literalize the moral that light must be captured, not granted. Final image reweights the premise—children play under lantern-light that is stored labor, not grace. Avoids sermon by letting the bottle’s silence speak. One thematic echo (“civilization from ashes”) is tolerated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—“brittle leaves where laughter once rang.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during salvage beats, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; POV modesty respected—he cannot know settlers’ inner lives, only their hands in soil. Register remains alchemical-minimalist without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. High density—“paper lanterns, once mere decorations, could be redesigned to harness solar energy by day”—does triple work (image, world-rule, thematic pivot). One paraphrase loop (“false comfort” x2) costs −0.2; otherwise zero scaffold. Final line earns its resonance: “wishes were unnecessary.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic rebuild is refreshed by alchemical engineering specifics—solarized lanterns, reed-weaving chemistry. The bottle as unopenable civic charter is a fresh inflection that grows from prior beats. Risk is moderate: quiet accumulation rather than twist, but coherence is high. Could swap setting with minor edits, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
