<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “cold star” of curiosity and the flutter of “wonder and dread” are embodied—but the contradictory impulses never clash in a single beat; the renunciation at the end is signaled rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels more observed than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the cameo blank’s reweighting from “unfinished” to “erased gap” tightens the stake once, and the final image of placing it back among the roots lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she forecloses the path of conquest and accepts curation-as-process. Orientation is swift; nonlinear inheritance is taught by 120 words and closure pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The astral orchard is rendered through filtered perception—luminous fruit, ozone scent, bark etched like forgotten language—each detail steering her inquiry. The crystalline bathroom micro-setting supplies the breakthrough beat, and the cameo blank as recurring object constrains her final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—pursue or relinquish forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the fruit’s vision threatens her own memory. A single meaningful tightening occurs at the second bathroom epiphany: acceptance forecloses possession. Cost is conceptual (she abandons the key), but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: knowledge as living process, not artifact. The cameo blank’s shift from puzzle to vessel-of-absence reweights the premise without moralizing. The final image of return crystallizes the thematic cost, though the insight is more serene than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“luminous fruits that hummed,” “brightened disquiet”—is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; the orchard’s voice feels ancient, Elara’s contemporary, all filtered through her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentences vary in length and opening. A few near-adjacent echoes (“simply complicated,” “nonlinear inheritance”) recur as thematic refrain rather than scaffold, so they read intentional. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; closure image is crisp.</comment>

<comment>The living-library-on-asteroid is fresh, yet the erased-memory-cameo and ascended-civilization vision flirt with familiar tropes; their synthesis through curation-as-process rather than conquest provides a non-obvious inflection. Risk is moderate, coherence high.</comment>
