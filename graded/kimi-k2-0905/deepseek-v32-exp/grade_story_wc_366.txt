<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet, sea-calibrated interiority is consistently shown through tactile beats (hand on cold wall, sea-glass palm). The contradiction between his reticence and the need to “protect” is dramatized in the decisive act of relighting, so the final endurance carries cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (placing glass, stacking cairn) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One clean shard—dock ascent to lantern room, descent to cove, return—held under Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “light/failure” tightens the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the beam revives with the glass anchor visible, reweighting safety as shared vigilance; cost is the perpetual return of the haunt. Orientation anchored by word 30. Causality intact: cairn mechanics foreshadowed in earlier letters motivate Elian’s action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, spiral stair, Fresnel lens, and sea-glass micro-setting all constrain movement and attention. The lantern room’s cold hum and the cairn’s tactile geometry are returned in the final image, charging the re-lit beam. Sensory economy favors touch and sight filtered through Elian’s mariner bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to balcony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“bottle the feeling of safety”—is signaled early and escalates as the lamp refuses to stay lit. The spectral chill intensifies on each return to the lantern room, narrowing options to: flee, endure, or anchor light. Protagonist’s agency: stacking guidance cairn and placing glass anchor directly enable the revival. Cost is the unending vigilance implied by the receding but not vanquished haunt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of inherited vigilance emerges from the concrete chain of anonymous letters and the glass-lensed light. No overt thesis stated; final image of glass catching sunrise reweights prior “ache” into beauty. Ambiguity remains: haunt is calmed, not defeated, avoiding moral tidiness. Subtext in silence between keepers feels honest to maritime solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter: salt air, stone weight, lens hum. Syntax lengthens under exertion, contracts under chill—prose mimics breathing. No dialogue, so voice purity unscathed. “Luminescent ache” and “cold, complex jewel” are memorable yet anchored to POV’s sensory reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with stair-climb labor and dawn surge; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “The lantern room at the summit was said to be haunted, not by ghosts of men, but by the lingering echoes of drowned sailors’ hopes” seeds theme and stakes. One paraphrase loop—“cold… chill… cold”—in lantern paragraph; minor. Closing line lands with crisp image, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: lighthouse haunt as accumulated fear of mariners rather than singular ghost. Cairn-code message system particularizes the world. Sea-glass talisman subverts typical lantern relic. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent resolution where light merely “calms” the haunt; coherence holds. Slight dock-to-beam familiarity keeps it sub-8.8.</comment>
