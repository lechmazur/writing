<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s historically reverent trait is stated repeatedly but only once—when it “honors every whisper”—does it visibly tilt a concrete present-tense choice; the interiority otherwise drifts into lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment of renunciation (standing still forever) is implied, not dramatized with felt cost, so the arc reads as elegant stasis rather than earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the humming of the towers anchors the wandering pulse in a resonant reconfiguration that makes “navigation without motion” legible. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than strict because/therefore; the flock-to-arrowhead linkage is taught early and paid off, so the lens holds, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers functions as both acoustic instrument and metaphysical compass; their hollow resonance directly enables the final anchoring of the pulse, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is biased to Elara’s quest—sound, dust-weight, stone texture—creating an atmosphere that guides the stillness goal without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stake is singular—anchor the wandering pulse by stillness—and tightens once when the bird pattern reveals the arrowhead’s conduit role; the price is the forfeiture of physical travel forever, though it is implied rather than scaldingly felt. Agency is mostly interpretive (reading birds, humming) so the escalation is intellectual, adequate for lyric mode but short of visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: navigation as inner attunement rather than movement. The arrowhead’s final glow reweights earlier history-worship into lived integration, avoiding explicit moral. The last-line proverb (“true navigation arises…”) is borderline thematic echo but saved by its imagistic cadence and placement after the concrete glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent perceptual signature: slow, sonorous syntax that mimics stone-skimming patience. Diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon (“harmonics,” “resonant network”) without academic drift. No dialogue to test, but the prose itself becomes character-specific music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control mirrors escalating resonance; sentences lengthen then compress at the humming climax. One scaffold loop—“centuries of layered dust” repeated with near-identical phrasing—dulls momentum slightly. Metaphors (towers as instruments) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles intrude on closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of archaeo-acoustic ecology with meditative non-movement feels fresh; trope of “found artifact as key” is transmuted through sonic rather than heroic logic. Risk in lyrical abstraction is balanced by concrete sensorial grounding. Final image of glowing arrowhead embedded in Elara’s essence offers a non-obvious synthesis that would collapse if relocated.</comment>
