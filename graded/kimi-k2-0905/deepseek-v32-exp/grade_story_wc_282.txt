<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—heat-mapping as lived obsession, body-lightness under fossil lift—but the “voice of the unknown” goal is stated more than pressure-tested; no contradictory want or flaw complicates the stance. The fossil-handling beats show micro-choices (aim scanner, follow glow) that credibly pivot him from observer to interpreter, yet the cost is purely epiphanic rather than a foreclosed path. Earned stasis feels willed rather than wrung. Still, the sensory-perceptual signature is strong enough to lift him into high-band territory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each heat-map pass layers emotional density until the cave itself glows in sync, a clean pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fossil settles back, the maps now “glow with new clarity,” a crystallized final image that reconfigures meaning without expositional summary. Cost is conceptual—the world now has a voice—visible in the last line. One scaffold loop (“the world after humans hibernated was no longer silent”) slightly dulls the cadence, keeping it under 8.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is more than backdrop: saline drafts narrow perception, mineral veins literally light the path, constraining Kaelen’s route and charging the final image. Micro-setting (floating fossil as lantern) fulfills the 9+ gate. Sensory selection skews to tactile and thermal, reflecting the heat-map vocation. One minor drift: “labyrinthine” is repeated twice, a small plaque on otherwise razor-sharp specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the silent Earth be given voice?—is signaled early and deepens through each heat-map pass. The fossil’s lift is the single meaningful intensification: it narrows options from passive recording to active channeling, cost legible in the shared levitation that leaves Kaelen changed. No secondary antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. Falls short of 8+ because the price is spiritual rather than a tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges through the fossil’s journey from living leaf to stone memory to floating lantern; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext reads in the cave’s synced glow—resilience encoded in mineral veins. Final image reweights prior grief into quiet joy, achieving resonance without moral. Minor sentimentality in “testament to transition and hope” keeps it under 8.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a geologist-poet idiom: “saline drafts,” “stone matrix,” “heat signatures” feel native to Kaelen’s education. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“the air thickened”—then widens for wonder, mirroring emotional arc. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied. One template cadence in “Here, I discovered… Here, I focused…” barely audible beneath textured control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences map emotion, tool function, and cave response. Metaphors stay physical and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Clause variation keeps momentum through a 700-word single scene. A lone paraphrase loop (“ancient and new… ancient magic”) costs a sliver. Closure line is crisp, free of ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses climate grief with geologic haunting; heat-mapping residual emotion is fresh, not a trope re-skin. Fossil-as-transceiver feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Risk taken in levitation is justified by cave’s “factually mystical” rule, taught early. Specificity of mineral veins lighting in sync prevents abstract drift. Slight bump down for thematic nearness to “last human witness” template, but the sensory method reclaims ownership.</comment>
