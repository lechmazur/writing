<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“frugality…key to seeing what others had wasted”—and embodied emotion pulses in the trembling hands. Yet the only micro-choice that costs him (aligning the tile) is executed without visible alternative or flaw-exposed struggle, so the renunciation feels slightly under-priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fused tile reweights the palace into a “monument to encrypted devotion,” cost felt in the irreversible fusion and the astronomer’s emptied satchel of further moves. Causal lattice holds—each schematic alignment tightens the next—so the lens stays clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The palace corridors, observatory cupola, and mosaic floor are not backdrop but instruments whose spatial relations dictate where Aris can step; the final image is charged because the tile becomes literally inseparable from the floor he stands on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes sharpen from abstract “covenant” to concrete “fuse or forsake” when the tile glows and symbols rise; the single turn is meaningful, but the price (loss of the tile as portable tool) is announced more than dramatized in the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: devotion = pattern-seeking frugality, love = equations in stone. The closing line reweights the quest itself as the true covenant, achieving quiet resonance that resists moral packaging while still feeling conclusive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Aris’s astronomer diction—”dying star,” “celestial beasts,” “dusty corridors”—and rhythmic control heightens at climax: “a wave of calm settled.” No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, but occasional modifiers stack—“soft, internal light,” “seamless gradient”—and two near-restatements (“encrypted devotion…coded into architecture”) create mild paraphrase loops. Closure beat itself is uncluttered, preserving momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes magic-square mysticism with architectural astronomy in a way that feels freshly specific; the “empirically ironic faith” twist reframes scientific parsimony as spiritual practice, a risk that pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
