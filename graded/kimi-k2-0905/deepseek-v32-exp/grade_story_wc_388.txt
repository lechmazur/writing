<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s drive to “excavate truth” propels every action; his observant trait shows in concrete pattern-spotting (ring-counting, dust-still moment). Interiority stays grounded in bodily sensation rather than labels. The final choice crystallizes earlier motive, but because we only glimpse the cost starting to return (dust creeping back), the emotional price feels legible yet not fully dramatized; still, the character arc is coherent and earned under situational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rumor → arrival → confetti → reassembly → tree code → diamond → activated sphere. The “stillpoint = orchard” turn is seeded by growth-ring numbers and geometry observations, paying off with Conceptual Repricing: the liquidation was deliberate reset to bury this secret. Closure shows visible cost (activating sphere trades life energy; dust already returning), satisfying Cost Proof test under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard’s paradox (lush inside poison storm) is vivid, specific, and immediately tied to Kaelen’s puzzle-solving. Sensory hierarchy (radioactive glow, numb fingers, cool diamond) tracks POV priorities. Environment literally shapes choice—storm halts inside sphere—and charges final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—truth vs comfortable lie—tightens when each clue shows larger complicity (orchard survives via murder of world). Escalation is causal: every deduction narrows option from “find gem” to “activate stillpoint at personal cost.” On-page reversal at diamond lift instantly demonstrates price (still air, flickering light, returning dust). Cost is visible and persistent under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme that knowledge itself can be weaponized emerges through events, never sermon. Subtext pulses in bargain letters, liquidation truth, and now Kaelen’s silence option. Final image (flickering diamond, creeping dust) reweights prior “salvation” trope into ethical trap. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no tidy moral stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Kaelen’s perception; diction stays within his investigative lexicon. Patterned metaphors (dust, stillness, fracture) taught early and recur at closure. Rhythm tightens under pressure through clipped clauses (“He pulled out a diamond the size of his thumb…”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: many sentences do double duty (“radioactive dust that glowed faintly under a bruised sky” sets scene + foreshadows storm stilling). Varied syntax; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent (diamond flaws as energetic map). No scaffold or paraphrase loops; minor participle openers but actions remain sequential. Ear test reads clean aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines post-apple-orchard, diamond-as-key, and “truth costs life” in fresh synthesis. Stillpoint = sanctuary state rather than place is non-obvious yet fully prepared. Corporate “liquidation” as cover adds sociopolitical bite. Specific detail (ring-count, confetti reassembly) prevents generic feel; twist feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
