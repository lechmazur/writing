<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “map scars” surfaces early and recurs, but the interior contradiction between fury and tranquility is asserted rather than dramatized; the micro-choice to hand the new poem over is present yet its causal link to her prior silencing is compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels moderate rather than acute. The censor-turned-ally arrival supplies external pressure but the status flip is stated, not staged, muting relationship-as-crucible. Motive coherence is solid; emotional embodiment hovers on the cusp of therapy-speak once (“furiously tranquil” repeated). Overall, strong spine, plausible change, but not yet razor-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: poem transferred, masks slipped, vigil re-started with partner—cost is the exposure of her once-forbidden voice and the alliance with her former censor. Causal lens dominates: envelope → observatory → timer-end → poem → alliance; each step because/therefore. Timer ding synchronizing with stranger’s entrance is a neat coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under lens. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark (observatory, storm, timer). The single explanatory line “He had left the envelope...” is retro-active but delivered within the same beat, so minor causality warp, not break. Enough tightening and cost for high-band but not immaculate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storm-dome, lightning flashes, telescope reflection, and timer click create a tight sensory circuit that repeatedly constrains attention; telescope mirror scene is the pivot where setting literally shows her scar-constellation, charging the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift. Weather is not backdrop but dictates light, sound and emotional pacing. The observatory functions as micro-setting-plus-tool; its optic train enables the self-recognition beat. High specificity, economy-driven, final image tethered—meets 9+ gate for object/environment charging image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover voice / rarefy truth—signalled in paragraph two and escalates through countdown; agency resides in enduring the wait then choosing to externalize the poem. Escalation is one-step but palpable: silence → written poem delivered. Cost is social exposure plus alliance with ex-censor, visible on page. Coincidence (timer ding = door) complicates, does not save. Under causal lens, pressure tightens once yet adequately; meets 8-band though not multi-turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: censorship vs. re-humanization through shared scars. Subtext carried chiefly by mirror-image and scar-map motif; no character sermonizes the moral. Final image (poem passed, storm ebbing) reweights “rarefy” from alchemy to ethical act—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Keeps complexity: alliance is fraught, not redemptive fairy-tale. Meets 9+ quick test for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person poi camera stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid (“storm-kissed wonder”), diction poetic but generally within poet-observer lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ruminative beats, clipped fragments when timer nears zero. No dialogue to test naturalism; prose voice is consistent if slightly perfumed. No head-hop or register drift. Close to 8-band; minor perfume keeps it middle-high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cartography of scars,” “stormlit silence”) flirt with density but pattern is taught early and returned at end, so forgiven. Minor paraphrase loop: “vigil was in pause” repeated 3x; could trim 1. No synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Closure image clean. Solid line-craft with room for tighter pruning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines censored-poet + observatory + darkroom timer + scar-mapping to produce fresh crucible; not a trope stack seen frequently. Envelope-in-timetable is deliciously odd yet believable. Conceptual turn from “rarefy” as chemical distillation to moral clarification feels earned. Risk level moderate; structure conventional. Sufficient originality for high-tier but not paradigm-shift.</comment>
