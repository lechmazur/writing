<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s interior contradiction—honest son of a con man—drives every beat; the ink-pot micro-choices under mortuary pressure embody his math-of-fair-trade motive. Embodied emotion is lean but precise: “weight-a brand in this silent room” fuses shame and vocation. Final renunciation of con tricks is earned by causal chain; cost is the drained pot, signalling future emptiness. Minor: father’s biography is off-stage, so paternal flaw is told more than enacted, capping at 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each guard-study/flower-delivery step is a because/therefore that narrows to the mental breach. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: “rigidity fractures, but fluidity endures” reweights Leo’s moral rule-set with social cost (chief’s conscience). Cost is legible on-page: emptied pot, dawn isolation. No plot amnesia; ink-pot logic is consistent, payoff foreshadowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prep-room micro-setting (embalming fluid, steel table, casket polish) constrains every tactical choice; proximity to bodies makes patience plausible. Sensory hierarchy is mortician-biased: chemical smells, label typography, metallic clinks. Spatial track is flawless: pot travels from shelf → pocket → table → shelf, states tracked. Weather absent but irrelevant; environment mirrored in “deathly vitality” tone; qualifies for 9-band but lacks one added constraint in final image, hence 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—father’s asylum—tightens via each surveillance discovery; one deepening suffices. Agency visible: Leo’s invented flower-drop lures the security chief; refusal to physically breach is active renunciation with felt moral cost. No coincidence; chief’s doubt is liquefied by ink-pot, a causal device. Cost: Leo embraces solitary dawn, father safe but relationship still hollow—price acknowledged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern: fair-trade math vs inherited con. Ink pot’s shift from heirloom to empty vessel reweights “mathematics” from equation to ethical fluidity. Final line “rigidity fractures, but fluidity endures” is conceptual re-pricing, not sermon. Ambiguity remains: asylum achieved yet filial rupture persists—tidy moral avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person limited stable; perceptual signature mortician-cold: “dusted the embalming fluid bottles,” “death’s honesty couldn’t be faked.” Rhythm modulates: short clauses under surveillance tension, longer reflective lines in casket polish beat. Dialogue sparse but subtext-loaded: “Consider the fairness of a trade” carries ethical trap. No head-hopping; diction stays within Leo’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences triple-duty (scene, interior, symbol) e.g., “vintage ink pot, tarnished silver and dried crimson inside.” Figurative language sparse; when used (“ideas flowed like water”) it pays off closure image. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase. Sentence openings varied; paragraph cuts tight. Proofing clean; tense stable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mortician noir with embassy espionage feels fresh; asylum via embalming-room patience reverses genre expectations. Ink pot as cognition-scrambler is magical but grounded in occupational metaphor—rigor mortis vs mental rigidity. Risky conceptual ending pays off under causal lens. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight; story could not swap pot for any prop without collapse.</comment>
