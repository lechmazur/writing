<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her bare feet on warm stone, the clipboard’s cool weight—but the “operatively gentle” trait is stated more than dramatized; we see nods and soft chant, yet no contradictory impulse that would let gentleness cost her something in-scene. The self-sacrifice is foreshadowed early, so her fade feels earned, but the emotional layering is smooth rather than jagged; she never surprises us or herself. Secondary characters remain silhouettes, so the relational crucible is thin; still, in a single-POV vignette this is acceptable. Overall, a credible arc of renunciation, but the absence of visible flaw-driven mistakes keeps her just shy of high-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s life-force leaves her body while the clans clasp hands, a visible, irreversible cost that reweights the terrace from war-memorial to living peace-shrine. Causal chain is tight: each chant beat draws moonlight into the clipboard, which then projects binding light; no prop teleports, no rule is invented late. Orientation is clean—who, where, when anchored by line 12. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of “price,” “cracks,” “muster” accrues until the final fade reconfigures meaning. One tightening only, but it is decisive; meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terrace is sketched with selective sensory strokes—warm stone, violet sky, cracked mosaics—each mirroring the theme of resilient imperfection. Spatial choreography stays coherent as representatives step into circle, clipboard drops at exact moment of Elara’s fade. Weather (midsummer, twin-moon convergence) functions as ritual clock, directly constraining when the final act can occur. Micro-setting qualifies via clipboard and terrace cracks; both re-appear in final image, charging closure. Tiny slip: “ancient songs” is auditory placeholder, but it is fleeting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—personal redemption through peace-sealing—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates by each moon-creep beat. One visible tightening: when clipboard glow forces her hands to tremble, we feel the life-drain altering tactics—she must keep chanting despite wavering stance. Cost is legible: body grows lighter, fingers loosen, life paid in real time. No reversal, yet the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence is absent; escalation is internally generated by her continued choice to hold the circle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete return of cracks/beauty: the terrace’s flawed mosaics echo Elara’s cracked life, both made luminous through acceptance rather than repair. Subtext operates in silence—tears on former warriors’ faces carry the moral weight; no one declares “peace is hard.” Final image reframes “flawed beauty” without moralizing: fallen clipboard among clasped hands. Avoids tidy maxim, invites reader to tend the cracks. Slight abstraction in “price of redemption” refrain could be pruned, but it is interleaved with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions—weight loss, moon blur—no head-hop. Diction is lyrical yet controlled: “slow dance of celestial bodies” is repeated motif, taught early, paid off at fade. Syntax shortens under stress—“She smiled, seeing the clans embrace”—mirroring her ebbing breath. Filter verbs minimal and motivated. Voice distinctiveness moderate; could tilt further into her idiom, but clarity is prioritised and succeeds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with ritual pacing. Metaphors are few, coherent—“web of shared understanding” extends spider-web introduced earlier. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One scaffold spot: “price of redemption” phrase recurs four times; while thematic, it edges toward template cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers moon-phase, emotion, or physical cue. Closure sentence is clean, image-driven, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Familiar trope—self-sacrificing peacemaker—gains freshness via ritual mechanics tied to celestial choreography rather than generic magic. Cracked terrace as peace-technology feels site-specific; not every fantasy war uses mosaics as conduit. Final fade into light is archetype, but here it is earned by clipboard’s earlier established rune-function. Risk level moderate; could push further by letting Elara’s gentleness fail once before final act. Still, synthesis feels organic, not checklist.</comment>
