<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is consistently poetic-scientific, her scarf-triggered visions dramatized rather than reported; the final renunciation—letting the scarf dissolve—pays off a chain of micro-choices and costs her last physical link to grandmother, earning the “forever” stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each hyperbolic trace thickens the library’s uncanny atmosphere until the wall ripples into a literal doorway; the Charged Poise closure (narrative constellations swirling around her) reweights “solitude” into communion without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The curved reading room, stained-glass atoms, and scarf-as-key are tactile, choice-constraining micro-settings; negative-curvature geometry is learned through her finger-tracing action, anchoring the impossible doorway in lived detail rather than tourist-catalog listing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single stake—reach the story-realm—tightens when each hyperbolic gesture costs her social visibility (patrons’ obliviousness) and emotional capital (scarf’s dissolution); the final doorway forecloses return to prior anonymity, price legible in the scarf’s vanishing light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of mathematics and memory: stories are not archived but spatial, a cosmology she physically enters; no moral is stated—the closing image of her hand tracing an invisible curve in now-empty air re-prices “observed solitude” as participatory myth-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic perception; diction marries physics to lyricism (“equations danced with metaphors”) without register drift; rhythmic compression under pressure (“wall before her rippled like water”) teaches the pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Near-zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image or motion; figurative density is high but coherent (hyperbolic light, silent sonnets) and peaks only after pattern is taught; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops; final line lands with crystalline brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Scientific-poetry library + hyperbolic geometry as portal mechanism is a fresh synthesis; risk of abstraction is accepted and paid off by grounding each geometric term in physical gesture; the scarf’s analog memories avoid digital cliché, making the concept irreplaceable.</comment>
