<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is present—her shrewdness surfaces in brokerage recall and the micro-choice to trace the envelope—but emotions are declared (“whimsically attentive,” “joy,” “warmth”) rather than embodied. Anya remains a gentle archetype; we never see her contradictory impulses under pressure, so the friendship’s depth feels summarized. The earned change (Elara pivots from profit to people) is stated, not dramatized with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a CR image: stars overhead shimmer “with approval,” reweighting Elara’s world toward compassion; the conceptual cost—she will keep integrating kindness into contracts—is legible. The causal chain holds: envelope slip → investigation → friendship → community honoring; each “because” advances options. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. However, the final beat is narrated summary rather than a crystallized gesture, muting the Resonant Reconfiguration punch.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Seaside port, cliff cottage, and star-scented library are sketched with selective salt-air and breeze detail that mirrors internal shift. The library’s repetitive “under the stars” tag becomes a scaffold loop, dulling specificity. No object or environment constrains a pivotal choice; the locket is emotional prop, not tactical. Thus fails 9+ gate for constraint-on-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens when Elara decides to find Anya, narrowing her goal. Yet escalation is gentle: no concrete obstacle or price is faced; the “cycles” expand off-page via montage. Agency is present but low-pressure; coincidence (lucky envelope) drives instead of challenging her shrewdness. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet compassion emerges through accumulating port-worker anecdotes rather than authorial thesis. Final paragraph’s starlit laughter offers resonant, non-literal answer. However, “cycles of compassion” is explicitly named twice, edging into thematic echo; the locket symbol stays ornamental, never re-pricing meaning. Subtext remains thin; silence or gesture could deepen irony.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Elara with consistent perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is smooth but generically literary—“whimsically attentive,” “cautious exuberance” recycle prompt diction, flattening voice distinctiveness. Dialogue is absent; prose rhythm is even, lacking idiosyncratic cargo-broker idiom. Voice neither obscures nor heightens closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, with mild syntactic variety; no grammar faults. Recurrent stock phrases (“breezy library under the stars,” “cycles of compassion”) create template cadence; four mentions in 800 words feel scaffolded. Figurative language is sparse and safe; no mixed metaphors, but also no high-density compression. Line-level competence supports momentum without standout texture.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—mistaken envelope sparks community honoring of hidden caregivers—is low-risk, feel-good territory; local specificity (port brokerage, symphony nights) helps, yet plot would survive with any coastal town. No bold structural risk or moral twist; warmth is predictable. The locket photo and “cycles” motif are familiar uplift devices, not transformed.</comment>
