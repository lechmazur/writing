<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—her gift-turned-curse of translating infant wails—threads every tactical move; the contradiction (artist-healer who once fled) is dramatized, not declared. A visible cost is paid when she weeps while "tattooing" silence into the soundboards, yet the prose occasionally lapses into quick emotional labels (“guilt washing over her”) instead of embodied contradiction, keeping her just shy of 9-band immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s re-leased ancient hush fuses with the forgiven cry, the firmware now croons a lullaby, and Elara’s stance is crystallized with felt cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is intact—each constellation-tattooed silence panel is a therefore-link that cumulatively softens the haunted sound pile-up. One minor orientation wobble: “meteor hush” is introduced before we know we’re inside a lab, but the phrase is swiftly tethered to place and later repaid in the closing image, so the Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lab’s “meteor hush” and resonator grids remain physically present, governing both acoustic action and character movement; the amber fossil is handled, wired, and finally memorialized—its wings-lit silhouette literally re-images inside the closing quiet. Sensory economy is tight (we get star-mapped skin, insect wings, and breath-held corridors), but an 8.8 gate requires one environmental constraint that final-instantly shapes tactics; the amber qualifies, yet the broader lab geography could have tightened one more choice beat to push into 9 terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s accusatory cries—escalates through each inscribed panel; the tightening is pattern-based (sound density lowers as constellations accrete) rather than causal reversal, fitting Accumulative design. A visible price is paid: younger-self visions force Elara to confront the literal moment she bolted during the meteor shower, foreclosing denial; the final hush is earned, though the escalation is single-track and could have used one intermediate risk beat to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic atonement emerges from action—tattooing quiet, translating wails—never sermonizes. The fossilized insect’s eternal pause reweights “flight” into “rest,” charging the closure without overt statement. Subtext in the handwritten letters (child’s missing warmth) intersects with Elara’s gift to create understated irony: she always knew the meaning of the cry, just not her own answer. Final lullaby image offers resonance, not moral, satisfying the 9-band spirit even if one line edges toward thematic echo (“she had finally hushed the dissonance”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is fever-dream lyrical yet precise: “meteor hush,” “constellation tattooist,” and “phantom frequencies” form a taught pattern that pays off in the lullaby cadence of the last line. Syntax compresses under pressure—short em-dashed clauses during firmware glitch—then widens into slow, star-lit sentences for calm, mirroring acoustic contraction. No dialogue to test, but internal diction stays within Elara’s artistic/astral lexicon; occasional elevated terms (“escritoire,” “resonator”) are justified by lab setting. Filter verbs are minimal; the piece is safe for 9+ territory save a trace of template cadence in tripled “she… she… she” anaphora mid-story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and information density: most sentences layer job, image, and motion (“she began to inscribe patterns into the soundboards, creating constellations of silence”). Mixed-metaphor risk appears only once—“time folded more tightly” beside “bleed like phantom frequencies”—but context keeps it coherent. Opening and closing lines serve as acoustic brackets, satisfying read-aloud ear test. Lacks true 9+ flawlessness because two adjacent lines paraphrase the same emotional beat (“guilt washing over her anew” after “she wept, the guilt washing over her”), a minor loop that dulls the climax half a degree.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing star-cartography tattoo art with acoustic exorcism feels fresh and inevitable; no extant template replicates this constellation-of-silence conceit. The haunted-firmware idea risks cliché, but here sound is literally inscribed, not just analogized, converting tech-horror into penance ritual. Specific risk is taken: a 740-word story spans two timefolds, yet coherence is preserved through amber-as-anchor and lullaby payoff. Transformation test fails if “tattooist” is swapped out—her profession governs both tool and metaphor—cementing high originality.</comment>
