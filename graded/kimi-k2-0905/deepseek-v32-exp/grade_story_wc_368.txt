<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s curiosity is vivid, but he never makes a visible choice that costs him anything; the illumination simply happens to him. The donor-heart backstory is evocative yet never alters present tactics or creates interior contradiction. “Quietly explosive” stays a label—no beat shows calm cracking into risky action. Closure is observation, not renunciation or decision, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tight accumulative design under a situational lens: each sun-trail adds texture until the wing’s dusting reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—wing turns to dust, reweighting beauty’s cost—but the causality is ambient, not driven by a decisive protagonist act. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. The lack of a visible cost-bearing choice keeps the closure effect muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tea-house levitation and valley-mist are sensuously tracked and directly charge the final image of drifting witness. Micro-setting (dye-stained hands, wing on table) constrains the only action—sun-tracking—so environment shapes tactic. Selective, body-filtered detail keeps the floating rock plausible without exposition dump. Setting never forces a hard choice, capping short of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering story-magnetism—remains abstract; no concrete price is risked or paid. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than narrowing options; the wing’s destruction is environmental, not a consequence of Kaelen’s agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when iridescence reveals symbols, but it changes knowledge without forcing trade-off. Stakes are legible but never viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: beauty’s peril, transplanted life, inherited narratives—all refracted through the wing’s短命 iridescence. No moral is stated; the dusting of the wing offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—does the heart’s pull now inhabit Kaelen?—without confusion. Slight abstraction of the central question keeps it from full 8+ charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays locked and lyric, with perceptual signature in dye-master color vocabulary and sun-angle precision. Syntax breathes—long misty clauses that tighten into short pulses of light. No dialogue, so voice carries all; register never drifts. Compressed diction under pressure (“quiet explosions”) is consistent and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from languid valley sentences to sharp prismatic fragments, mirroring light refraction. Occasional modifier stacks (“valley-mist wonder that blurred the lines”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric density. No loops or synonym churn; information is layered. One mixed metaphor (“stories like iron to lodestone” beside “moths to flame”) slightly blurs vehicle coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating dye-master using sun-tracking through a morpho wing to decode narrative magnetism is a fresh synthesis of magic-realist science. Familiar transplant metaphor is re-inflected via chromatic craft. Risk lies in near-lyric stillness, but coherence holds. Could swap “stories” for “fame” with minor edits, keeping it from 8.5+ inevitability.</comment>
