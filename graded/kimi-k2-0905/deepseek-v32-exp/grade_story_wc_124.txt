<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation is lucid and personal; the prologue-style summary keeps us from seeing contradictory impulses *in scene*. Only one micro-choice—uncorking the vial—actually alters her tactical position; everything else is memory montage. That single beat earns the insight, so the arc is credible but thinly dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: pollen = ancestral residue, tears = love’s fingerprint; cost is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of scent/light imagery reweights the stake once. Orientation crystal-clear by line 3. Causality gap: UV lantern is introduced as fait accompli rather than earned tactic, a minor but visible seam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse, UV lantern, and perfume vial all constrain tactics and charge the final image—each object’s physical state changes (lantern on, vial empty, blossom fluoresces). Sensory selection skews to scent and filtered light, mirroring Elara’s professional bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. World rule (extinct flora revived) is learned through action, not lecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why scents wound—tightens once when vial aroma forces on-page tears, proving the hypothesis. Escalation is textural: UV reveal + pollen cloud deepen the *meaning* of her grief rather than creating external jeopardy. Visible cost: she accepts future exposure to triggering smells—an Earned Stasis that forecloses emotional avoidance. Agency is interior but legitimate under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as physical residue—emerges concretely via pollen fluorescence rather than exposition. Subtext resides in silent tear-streaked face under UV glow; no moralizing speech. Final image reweights early “wistful” stance into resolved custodianship of legacy. Ambiguity lingers: will future clients’ lanterns also carry grief? Complexity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical, stable distance. Perceptual signature skews to photons and odor molecules—perfect for a lantern broker. Rhythm swells during pollen release—“shimmering cloud, visible only under the UV light”—then contracts to single tear, mirroring emotional crest. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon for an itinerant tradeswoman.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template churn. Information density high—e.g., “crystal shadows danced under the filtered sun” does three jobs in eight words. Two adjacent near-repeats: “transformation completed as the blossom shed its pollen” echoes prior “transformation was underway”; mild loop, −0.2. No strained metaphors; register consistent. Closing line lands with punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of scent-memory physics with extinct-plant resurrection feels fresh, not stitched. Lantern-broker profession is specific lens on light, not gimmick. Conceptual turn—pollen as data archive—earned by prior UV logic. Risk is moderate: lyric montage over scene, but coherence holds. Could transpose to another grief-healing setting, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
