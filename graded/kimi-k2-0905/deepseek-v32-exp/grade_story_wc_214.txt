<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s quiet interiority is consistent and specific—his tactile handling of the glass shard, his nightly tracing ritual, his felt smallness beneath the dome all embody a believable cosmic-lonely psyche. The final crystallization—“endings could be beautiful”—is earned by the iterated empathetic star-watching and the glass’s warming pulse, so the renunciation of despair carries visible cost. Yet the story never lets him make a true micro-choice that risks anything concrete (no job threatened, no offer refused), so the arc is observational rather than crucible-forged; the empathy stays emotional, not tactical. Still, within lyrical mode the interior contradiction (“yearning vs. accepted solitude”) remains active in scene and charges the ending.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each meteor passage layers density until the final image re-weights the stake—stillness becomes alive. The glass’s glow, the warming hand, and the “golden pool” on the console act as pattern-teaching repetitions that culminate in a Charged Poise: Kael stands guard, options reconfigured, loneliness now chosen not imposed. Orientation is anchored early (“Shooting Star Tracking Station” by line 2); causality is lyric, not linear, so no causal break. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: he embraces perpetual custodianship of moments, foreclosing any larger cosmic claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The station dome, glass shard, and meteor streaks function as micro-setting objects that constrain attention and finally charge the closing image; spatial choreography stays clean (viewport-to-console-to-swept corridor). Sensory selection favors visual motion and haptic warmth, filtered through Kael’s janitorial bias—dust, gleam, swept floors—so environment guides his ritual pacing. No overwrought sky-catalogue; each stellar detail is routed through his empathetic projection, keeping economy tight. Only minor slip: “primal elegance” is named twice, slightly abstract, but the final golden pool literalizes it, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can solitude become generative?—tightens via escalating meteor intensity and the glass’s rising temperature, a lyric deepening rather than plot reversal. Agency is attentional: Kael’s choice to keep watching, keep sweeping, keep holding the shard narrows his life-path to custodial stillness; the cost is lifelong anonymity, felt in the hush. No external antagonist, but internal fear of insignificance is pressured by each dying star. Closure crystallizes that pressure into earned stasis; no cap breached.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges from iterated images—sweeping motion beneath motionless stars, glass glow that pulses yet stays—never sermonized. Subtext operates in silence: the unswept corridor would mean cosmic disorder, so his labor is love. Final image reweights broken glass from trash to beacon, a CR that makes vulnerability the price of quiet radiance. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the hush, yet emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice carries a steady cosmic hush cadence—long sentences mirror star drift, then compress in meteor flashes. Perceptual signature is janitorial: Kael sees “pristine floors,” “dust mote,” “gleam,” never academic jargon. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks; repetition is pattern, not artifact. Rhythm modulates with celestial motion, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety high; information density strong (“yellow lantern glass, a smooth shard that glowed with soft, inner light” does triple object-work). No mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, each image re-used (glass glow → star trails → final pool). Minor scaffold: “tracing the path of falling stars” phrase recurs 4×; but it is the story’s drum and pays off in last line, so −0.2 only. Copy clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-janitor-as-star-keeper is fresh angle; yellow lantern glass repurposed as talismanic lens feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Stillness-as-alive concept is non-obvious synthesis of Zen and astro-custodial labor. Risk is quiet ending, but coherence holds. No derivative plot; transformation test passes—janitor specifics cannot be swapped out without collapse.</comment>
