<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation is arresting—teaching suffocation to breathe—but interiority slips into thesis-statements (“This was the lesson:…”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. His single on-page decision—to allow the encroachment by hovering a hand near the ring—does carry cost and changes the relationship state from solitude to shared breath, so the arc lands. Yet we never feel his body under pressure; emotional embodiment stays abstract (“loaded emptiness,” “hollowed look”) and the epiphany arrives pre-interpreted. Sufficient for a tight 700-word arc, but not quite vivid enough to hit the 7.4+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is present and resonant: the final image of two people breathing under fading starlight reconfigures the premise—silence becomes shared lungful air—under Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; the “because” is psychic resonance through scars, not concrete beat-by-beat linkage, and that pattern is announced early and held. Cost is felt conceptually rather than physically, satisfying the cost test. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 5; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Starlit charcoal sanctuary is evoked with selective sensory hits—starlight casting silhouettes, dust underfoot—each filtering through the keeper’s caretaker bias. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting: its tremble without a hand rewrites the spatial rule, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single move from threshold to seated dust. While no environmental detail literally blocks escape, the ashen ground and fading threshold metaphorically constrain the choice to stay and breathe together, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence teach breathing?—is signaled early and tightens once: solitude vs. encroachment. The tightening is lyric rather than causal: the ring’s ghost-chime reweights the stake from eternal silence to shared respiration. Agency is present in the keeper’s hand-hover acceptance, but the cost is conceptual (loss of pristine isolation) not visceral; no concrete resource is forfeited on-page. Sufficient for 600-800 words, but lacks the visible price that would push ≥7.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through recurrence of breath/bridge/ash rather than thesis: “burning bridges carefully” flips from isolation tactic to connective path. The final double-breath reprises the early “loaded emptiness,” reweighting it as shared lung-space. No moral is stated; ambiguity lingers—will tomorrow choke them again? Subtext sits in the unstruck ring now obsolete. One minor abstract phrase (“teach suffocating to breathe”) slightly over-articulates, keeping it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distances yet stays pierced through keeper-perception: starlight “casting long, soft silhouettes” is caretaker-language. Syntax lengthens with meditative commas, then shortens at ring-tremble—“He lifted a hand”—mirroring intake of breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Occasional elevated diction (“crafted silence,” “cauterized”) borders register drift but remains consistent with ceremonial tone; no head-hopping. Patterned elision (“linked through scars”) is taught early and paid off at entry, keeping lens legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is strong: sentence length varies with respiratory cadence, propelling the lyric accumulation. Only two paraphrase loops (“loaded emptiness” echoed) and one therapy-speak phrase (“shared wounds”) slightly dull the peak; -0.2 applied. Metaphors stay coherent—bridges/ash/breath—without mixed vehicles. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Final image is clean, uncluttered, and earns its pause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Conceptual inversion—burning bridges as life-giving path—feels fresh yet inevitable; the caretaker of shadows who gardens in ash is specific, not archetype. Starlight sanctuary and scar-linkage synthesize familiar grief-ritual tropes into a single spatial metaphor. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric ending eschews conventional confrontation, but coherence never wavers. Doesn’t push into 8.5+ because the emotional aftereffect, while genuine, relies on reader’s personal scar map rather than a jagged story-specific surprise.</comment>
