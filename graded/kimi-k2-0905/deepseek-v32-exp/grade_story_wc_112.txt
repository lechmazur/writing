<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Kael’s obliging nature is shown through his quiet, self-driven mission rather than explicit service beats; his internal contradiction—seeking validation yet shunning glory—peaks in the lever pull that risks ridicule. The moment of shared awe with Dr. Aris crystallizes a status shift from mechanic to co-discoverer, but we never see how his kindness might complicate or cost him. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tools clicking softly against his hips”), but the epiphany is softly stated rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or new risk. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (truth > personal acclaim) is legible and paid for in the fading hologram’s light.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: Kael’s private theory → twilight alignment → lever → hologram proof → shared reconfiguration of scientific truth. Orientation is clean within 80 words; the nexus and dormancy clock are anchored early. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the lateral-time model’s glow reweights their worldview, and the cost is the station’s habitual reserve melting into vulnerable camaraderie—felt in Dr. Aris’s hand on Kael’s shoulder. No causal breaks; the Mothraals’ stirring is complication, not resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Gas-giant twilight, magnetic nexus, and leathery-wing dormancy are tightly filtered through Kael’s mechanic gaze—tools, spires, holographic console—so environment constrains timing and tool choice. The “mechanically warm” air becomes a micro-setting that mirrors emotional thaw after the proof. Spatial choreography is flawless: corridor → deck → console → window view → external nexus, all tracked without drift. One hairline slip: “embrace” is metaphorically pushed a sentence too far, softening the precision edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes are single and dominant: prove lateral time before Mothraals reactivate and warp the fields. The tightening is the fading twilight alignment window—one quiet but irreversible clock. Agency is present (Kael pulls the lever), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool breaks, no social punishment, only the shared risk of error. That intellectual wager is sufficient under an accumulative lens, yet lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges sideways: time’s lateral drift parallels the station’s emotional drift from cold professionalism to intimate wonder. The hologram’s fade reweights the opening “profound quiet” into an earned hush of acceptance. No moral is stated; the final image of Aris’s hand replaces exposition with tacit reconfiguration. The concept stays specific to this orbit, resisting universalist abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Kael’s perceptual signature—metallic tastes of brass lever, soft hum as “mechanically warm,” twilight colors refracted through mechanic vocabulary. Syntax lengthens during hologram reveal, then compresses into the final handshake—rhythmic modulation mirrors emotional arc. No head-hop; Dr. Aris is observed from outside, preserving POV modesty. Diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon except one near-overreach: “esoteric needs” sounds researcher-adjacent rather than grease-under-nails.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Information density is high—each sentence advances either setting, character, or concept. Metaphors are sparse and clean; the single mixed risk “hush of beating wings at rest” is justified by alien biology and paid off at closure. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive, and free of scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time premise is familiar philosophically, but here it is grounded in a mechanic’s tactile test using asteroid alignments and holographic consoles—specific, orbital, non-academic. Risk is taken: quiet scientific proof instead of melodramatic time-slip, and it lands via conceptual repricing rather than spectacle. Transformation test passes: swap Kael’s profession or setting and the entire emotional calculus collapses. Fresh inflection is the union of alien dormancy clock with human emotional dormancy thawing in parallel.</comment>
