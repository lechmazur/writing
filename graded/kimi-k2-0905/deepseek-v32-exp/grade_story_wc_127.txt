<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—professionally thorough charlatan yearning for authenticity—is dramatized in the blotter-petal beat. The embodied shift from static crackle to hollow inhalation shows emotion under pressure, not labels. The final renunciation is earned by prior causal chain: synthetic joy tastes false against real sorrow → she drops the petal. Cost is visible: her livelihood tool becomes dust, yet the micro-choice hierarchy is narrow for 700-word scope and the “grotto’s gratitude” drifts toward pat personalization, keeping her just shy of 7.5+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blotter-petal drop is a Decisive Change with felt cost—her trade literally crumbles. Causal lens holds throughout: “static crackle → detects residue → senses hollowness → drops petal.” Orientation is anchored by 63 words; no debt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the grotto’s static reweights her synthetic joy into ash. The final image reconfigures her future tactics without exposition. Minor slip: “transformation completed” is iterated three times, a templated cadence that dulls the last beat by −0.3, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Amber grotto is not backdrop; its translucent walls emit static that she reads like a seismograph—setting as tool. Micro-setting (blotter petal) is handled twice and recharged at closure when it turns to dust, constraining her next move. Spatial choreography is clean: she waits → examines → inhales → drops → steps out. Dusk light evolves with her shift, mirroring without overt symbolism. Missing 9-band: no environment or object directly shapes the final tactical decision beyond symbolic discard; hence 8.6 capped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—authenticity vs. counterfeit—is signaled in line 1 and tightened once: counterfeit joy tastes hollow → petal dropped, path foreclosed. Agency is internal yet visible; no coincidence. Cost is the loss of her trade tool and the income it represents. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words; however, the absence of an external antagonist or secondary reversal keeps pressure intimate rather than crushing, capping at low 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of the merchandise: the dealer becomes the product’s final consumer, and the product fails her. No explicit thesis; resonance lives in the dust motes of a discarded petal. Subtext is carried by static electricity—science as soul detector—without exposition. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: she steps into night carrying “grotto’s warmth,” a quiet repricing of authenticity as portable. Slight softness: “fusion of insight with empathy” is named once, a hairline echo, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: molecules on blotter, crackle on skin. Syntax grows shorter under the final inhalation beat, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Static electricity as sensory verb (“she sensed the gratitude”) is the lone overreach—anthropomorphizing the grotto risks POV leakage, −0.4. Otherwise, diction stays within her chemist lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences multi-task (light/shadow “danced like silent patrons” sets tone + stakes). No paraphrase loops; only “transformation completed” repeats three times, a −0.3 template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—electricity as emotional Geiger counter. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line (“blotter petal…crumbled into dust”) resolves with tactile cost. Density is high; every paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Hairline slip keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Counterfeit-emotion black market is fresh, yet the arc—criminal repents via aesthetic epiphany—leans on familiar redemptive template. Static electricity as emotional residue detector is the specific inflection that lifts it: world-rule is taught early and paid off at climax. Transformation test fails: swap petal for forged painting and grotto for gallery, arc still functions, preventing 9.0. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks. Hence high 8-band.</comment>
