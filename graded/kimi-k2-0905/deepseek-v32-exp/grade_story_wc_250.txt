<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority stays lyrical and consistent (“spiralingly calm” anchors every beat), but the child-ghost remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is missing and the final empathy turn feels willed rather than paid for in visible cost. The dental mirror operates as an extension of her gaze, yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens her composure; she never hesitates or recalibrates, so the arc is static perfection rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter-light motif thickens the pattern until the water itself becomes a taught galaxy, delivering a Charged Poise closure. Causality is poetic but legible—mirror-angle → new constellation → child-spirit edges upward—so the soft mystery is functional. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral (the dock returns to quiet, guardian still alone), which slightly lowers punch, yet the rule-set is internally consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick metal, warehouse slats, and black-mirror canal are re-used with precise sensory economy; each new stripe of light literally re-plots the visible world. The micro-setting (dental mirror) becomes the pivot that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible body or light positions—so environment constrains tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coax a drowned child’s spirit toward star-recognition—tightens via pattern accumulation, not reversal. Each new constellation is a micro-turn that raises the ghost’s visibility; the risk is spiritual stasis, not physical danger. The price (guardian’s solitude, perpetual vigil) is abstract but legible on the final quiet dock; a sharper tangible loss would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: stars can be re-made from human scraps when sky fails. Subtext lives in the act—light through broken architecture—never flattened into moral. Final image reweights the premise: darkness taught not by sermon but by mirrored constellation, achieving Conceptual Repricing without thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person clings to Elara’s perceptual grammar: “stillwater tension,” “black mirror hiding forgotten things,” syntax coils like canal currents. No head-hop; distance stays tight to her hand-level choices. Pattern-taught repetition (“spiralingly calm”) pays off in cadence, not monotony. Dental mirror’s tiny lexicon is never exceeded, so diction remains credibly guardian-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense; every sentence layers light, water, or emotional valence. Metaphors stay coherent (weaver → Lyra → star map), no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “spiralingly calm” appears four times—acceptable because pattern-taught and closure-charged. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; sentences breathe with paragraph variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: industrial dock + dental mirror + constellation-loom to heal ghost-child = specific, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into preciousness, yet restraint and tactile detail keep it grounded. The transformation test fails if any element is swapped—mirror’s clinical fragility versus telescope, dock’s post-rain cobalt versus meadow—proving irreplaceability.</comment>
