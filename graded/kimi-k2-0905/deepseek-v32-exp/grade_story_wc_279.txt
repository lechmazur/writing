<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her chalk-stained fingers sifting sand, her refusal to look up when challenged—but the “socially perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; she never actually tests or risks status. The final smile is earned, yet the cost feels ambient rather than personal—no chalk stub broken, no social capital spent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush becomes a shared, re-weighted silence whose cost is the mandala’s imminent dissolution. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight “because/therefore,” but the lens is taught early and held. The tile flake’s hum-to-hush progression supplies the decisive reconfiguration; the price is the ephemeral art itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mist, acoustics, and granular sand are filtered through Elara’s artist-eye; the lilac veil and echo-dampening stone guide her decision to let the pattern blur. The grotto never feels generic—every sensory choice serves the emergent hush. Micro-setting succeeds: the tile flake acts as portable acoustic chamber, constraining where she places the final grain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“discover meaning in the mess”—stay abstract; no concrete resource is risked or foreclosed. Escalation is atmospheric: whispers fade into hush, but this is texture, not narrowing options. The woman’s outburst is the only pressure spike; it neither complicates tactics nor exacts a rippling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: impermanence as the only shape left after facts dissolve. The mandala’s blur is the non-literal answer, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—fingers wiping chalk on trousers—avoiding overt thesis. Final line’s “lavender clarity” flirts with echo-statement but just stays on the image side of the line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: color-as-emotion, sound-as-texture. Syntax loosens appropriately—“the void left behind was a messy, confusing silence”—mirroring the Unlearning. No head-hop; acoustic POV remains consistent. Minor register drift toward prompt-lexicon (“socially perceptive”) is absorbed into voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured but disciplined: “lilac haze that softened edges and bred a deep, pervasive unease” packs scent, vision, and dread into one clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances sand-pattern or acoustic field. Single overripe cluster—“beautiful, chaotic connections they still shared”—is forgivable at climax. Read-aloud rhythm surfs from whisper to hush without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“Unlearning” as worldwide amnesia is familiar SF territory, yet framing it through chalk-art acoustic mandala feels fresh. Whispering-gallery tile flake is a lovely, specific tech-magic object. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot, but coherence holds. Could swap “Unlearning” for any mass doubt, so freshness is local, not systemic.</comment>
