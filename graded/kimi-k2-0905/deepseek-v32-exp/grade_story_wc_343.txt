<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is repeatedly named but only once dramatized—when she kneels to decode the hopscotch board; otherwise she observes, sketches, and explains without contradiction or cost. The final moment of “sociable isolation” is asserted, not embodied: we are told she feels separate even as the captain claps her shoulder, but no interior fracture or forfeiture is shown. Competence outweighs struggle; the journal entry and phrasebook use proceed without error or hesitation, so the discovery feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: murmuration → luminance → hopscotch cipher → coordinates → course change, each beat causally triggered by the previous. Closure lands as Decisive Change with light cost (the luminance fades, the birds disperse), satisfying the lens. However, the hopscotch board appears only at the 75 % mark—too late to shape earlier tactics—so the turn feels engineered rather than foreshadowed; still, no causality break occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brass fittings, creaking timbers, and the etched hopscotch grid give tactile specificity; the starling strands supply a luminous, kinetic counter-texture. Spatial choreography is secure: deck → wheel → prow, bodies tracked without drift. The airship never constrains her choices—she could have decoded the pattern in any locale—so the setting decorates rather than pressures; capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early (“chart the next great discovery”) and tighten once when the luminance-map aligns with the hopscotch cipher, foreclosing the possibility that the vision was illusion. Yet no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized—time, tools, social credit, or personal risk remain untouched—so the escalation is intellectual, not visceral. The protagonist never faces an opposed force or a live dilemma; pressure is situational but mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of “sociable isolation” is stated repeatedly but emerges only as label; the captain’s shoulder-clap is too slight to reweight the concept. The murmuration-as-map idea is fresh, yet its implications (collective intelligence vs. lone cartographer) remain unexplored. Resonance is decorative rather than charged; no image or gesture reconfigures the premise at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perception; diction (“brass fittings,” “dog-eared pages”) is consistent and atmospheric. Rhythm is steady, but syntactic variety is limited—many sentences open with participial or prepositional phrases, creating a lull. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is competent, not yet singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, readable, and free of loops or mixed metaphor. Occasional filler creeps in (“felt both grand and lonely,” “mesmerizing prelude”) that could be cut without loss. No artifact touches the closure beat; momentum remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of starling murmuration, sky-written map, and hopscotch cipher is an original synthesis; the image of luminous strands between wings feels new. Tropes (plucky apprentice, antique airship) are familiar but re-contextualized through the avian cartography. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids gimmick yet stops short of deeper strangeness.</comment>
