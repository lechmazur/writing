<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is legible and consistent; her gentle, reverent handling of the rope embodies “technically gentle” and shows micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is present—guilt vs. ardor—but remains generalized (“a weight lifted,” “snowmelt ardor”) rather than enacted through idiosyncratic thought or bodily specificity. The decisive change—braiding the names alive—is earned, yet the cost feels abstract because the narrative never risks her physically or socially. Still, the arc coheres and her craft roots every action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the rope becomes a “lattice of luminescent remembrance,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the card disintegrates, the names are now inseparably fused to the artifact. Causal chain is intact: card codes the rope → rope sings → card dies. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no disorientation served later, so no penalty. Lens is Causal; each braid-tweak tightens options until sound is the only path left. One minor loop: “technically gentle” is asserted twice without new inflection, but it never obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ice dome, aurora, hemp-and-silver rope, brittle punch-card—each detail is tactile, cold, and filtered through Elara’s caster-eye. The rope doubles as micro-setting and tool: its stiffness dictates her slow re-weave, and its final glow is inseparable from the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from altar to dome never drifts. Aurora shifts mirror stakes without overt symbolism. Meeting 9+ gate: the rope’s material state directly constrains the final luminous braid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and sharpened by the card’s fragility. One meaningful tightening: each re-braid increases audible syllables, narrowing options toward total vocal resurrection. Cost is conceptual (card lost, rope forever changed) rather than bodily or social; still legible on-page. No reversal, but escalating resonance satisfies Causal lens. Could reach 8.8 if a concrete personal price (frozen fingers, social transgression) were paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as malleable material like wax—emerges through action, not assertion. The rope’s transformation from dead relic to living chorus reweights the premise: preservation demands destruction of the original vessel. Subtext whispers that forgiveness is itself a casting process, but the piece avoids stating it. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual filter—caster metaphors, temperature, aurora pulses. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Phrasing tilts toward lyrical elevation (“snowmelt ardor,” “prismatic sparks”) yet stays coherent with her reverent craftsmanship. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for patience, terse fragments when light bursts. Dialogue absent by design; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, rhythmic, and mostly lean; sentences advance image or motive. Occasional lyrical clusters (“snowmelt ardor” twice, “luminescent remembrance”) flirt with purple but never stall causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One mixed metaphor—“cradle of rediscovery” jars slightly against icebound architecture—keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Forging sound from rope-braid via punch-card is a fresh synthesis of craft-magic; not a trope template. The ice-aurora forge feels inevitable yet new. Risk is taken with lyric escalation over physical danger, and it pays off in conceptual re-pricing. Could push 8.8 if the card’s code logic were more specifically braided into the rope’s structure earlier.</comment>
