<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solitary prophet’s contradiction—yearning to transmute silence yet addicted to the next threat—stays implicit; the micro-choices (charcoal sketch, naming chords, final strike) are concrete and cost-lined. Interiority avoids label-speak; salt-etched skin and “eyes holding shifting greys” give embodied signature. No second character, so relationship crucible waived; isolation itself becomes pressure. Endurance of the wave-harmonized raft is credible renunciation with felt weariness— Earned Stasis met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each strike layers sonic density until the closing sphere reweights the stake (“music richer for the encounter”)—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no penalty. Causality intact: because he sketches silence → therefore fractal blooms → therefore wave harmonizes. Final image crystallizes options: perpetual uneasy symphony = visible price. One micro-turn (silence predicted → silence harnessed) tightens the lattice; no soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard-as-raft constrains every tactic—roots tangled in driftwood dictate where he can stand, strike, or brace. Sea-glass resonator and suspended shells are tactile tools whose placement is tracked; spatial choreography survives the wave breach. Blue hour indigo melt is not mere backdrop—it supplies the chromatic void that silence will fill, charging closure. Weather (nimbus swirl) is read like notation, turning sky into sheet-music the protagonist must physically answer; environment > postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the orchard’s song against predicted silence. Escalation = density accrual: each fractal layer thickens stakes until wave tests the lattice. Agency: prophet’s decision to slam resonator converts threat into timbre—visible price is exhaustion and perpetual vigilance foreclosed. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (wave arrival) complicates, not resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—artistry forged from menace—emerges via sound-into-silence inversion, never asserted. Subtext lives in gesture: mallet raised “with all his strength” = acceptance of endless labor. Final carillon raindrop image reweights prior silence as necessity, offering resonant non-moral answer. No thesis line; avoids sermon while leaving after-image of uneasy beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric fixed to prophet’s perceptual filter: “shifting greys of the horizon” = eyes, not sky. Syntax breathes with cadence—long clauses for swell, fragmentary “A soft, clear note bloomed” for percussive hit. Diction stays salt-stained, never academic; “carillon of rain” coinage is fresh yet legible. No head-hop; distance stable. Pattern of elision (time between wave sighting and strike) taught by earlier fractal compressions, paid off in closure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from languid maritime cadence to staccato strike sequence; sentence openings vary. Information-dense: single sentence can sketch silence, cue tool, and launch fractal. No mixed metaphors—wave harmonized, not “defeated.” Two minor paraphrase loops (“ever-evolving lattice of harmony” adjacent to “complex…lattice”) but not in closure beat; −0.2. Line-level artifacts do not obscure causality or final resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating citrus orchestra that makes silence audible is non-obvious synthesis; prophet’s meteorological musicology feels singular. Risk—lyric accumulative structure without conventional antagonist—heightens coherence because pressure is sonic density itself. Transformation test: swap raft for island and whole mechanism collapses. No trope recycling; sea-glass xylophone is freshly particular. Final carillon rain crystallizes prior imagery, making invention feel inevitable.</comment>
