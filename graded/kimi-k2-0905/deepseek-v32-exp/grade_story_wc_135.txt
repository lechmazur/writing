<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive to “compile fragments into meaning” drives every beat; the trumpet valve acts as an embodied contradiction—silence she must break—creating credible internal pressure. Her internal experience is rendered through concrete sensory filters (cold brass, fog, ledger odor) rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice to sound the trumpet is prepared by micro-choices (returning at dawn/dusk, sharing ink discovery) so the renunciation of silence carries visible cost: she surrenders her safe role as observer to become audible leader. Missing secondary-character crucible keeps it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the first trumpet note reweights exile from wound to layered history with undeniable conceptual cost—voices once erased are now amplified. Causal chain holds: because she finds missing-ship log → therefore she reframes exile → therefore she risks public speech. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by word 42 (“ivory harbor gleamed…”) avoids penalty. One smooth transition (evening→fog) keeps mosaic within Track B rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor’s post-rain slickness constrains movement—boots click, crate used as podium—integrating setting into action rather than postcard backdrop. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist’s bias: ledgers’ salt-stained pages, gull cry missed “deeply,” trumpet’s metallic chill. Micro-setting (trumpet valve) evolves from silent relic to charged amplifier, directly shaping climax. No occupational-system depth required; selective detail keeps scene breathable at 748 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of communal voice—signaled early; pressure tightens when each interval reveals another missing record, foreclosing the option to remain private scholar. Protagonist’s decision to stage twilight ceremony is the visible reversal that narrows options: she trades exile’s anonymity for public accountability. Cost is legible—she risks being dismissed again if revelation fails. Missing credible resource loss (time/stamina) keeps it under 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “history as layered silence” emerges through recurrent images of preserved ink, missing pages, and finally the sounded trumpet—no explicit thesis stated. Subtext operates in gesture: handing out small discoveries like rain-proof ink mirrors her deeper desire to hand back voice. Final image reframes absence as resonance rather than void. One near-echo of prompt language (“compile fragments into meaning”) is embedded mid-story, not final paragraph, minimizing preachiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is archivist-centric—world noticed through cataloguing impulses (“dust motes dancing in the light” seen as data). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for sift-work, staccato phrases under climax (“Her voice, though unamplified, carried”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Register stays within coastal, post-exile lexicon without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean: high sensory density without purple overload, strong verbs (“gleamed, dripping, clicked, sifting”). One scaffold pair detected: “fragments into meaning” / “scatter of records” within 3 sentences—minor loop, not near closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise freshens post-apocalyptic-recovery trope by focusing on archivist-as-healer rather than warrior-scout. Trumpet valve repurposed from ceremonial tool to political instrument feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Synthesis of maritime grief with archival method gives local specificity. Risk is present—quiet, lyric climax rather than spectacle—yet coherence stays intact.</comment>
