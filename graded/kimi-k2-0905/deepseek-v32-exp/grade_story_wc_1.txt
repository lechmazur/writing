<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—hands trembling, molding fear into focus—yet the moment she decodes the ledger the prose pivots to exposition, telling us “motivation deepened” rather than showing a contradictory impulse in scene. The adaptive trait is asserted, not dramatized; no visible trade-off or cost attaches to her decision to create rather than retaliate. Closure is a declared stance (“shine brighter”) without a micro-choice that forecloses an alternate path. Still, her perceptual filter—glass art, frost patterns—remains consistent and character-specific, keeping the score above mid-range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: smuggler ledger → rival name → decision to create. Orientation is clean—canyon, night, frost—within 50 words. The closure is an Earned Stasis (renunciation of revenge) but cost is only rhetorical (“scorched testament to her own strength”) rather than embodied; no new constraint or price shapes future tactics. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity, no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting: they physically constrain decoding of the ledger and mirror glass technique, charging the final image. Canyon stars supply tonal vastness but do not affect tactics; still, the frost alone satisfies the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays tight—cold stone, scorched paper edge—filtered through glass-artist eye. Spatial anchor holds: she sits, stands, pockets strip; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival and purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when frost patterns reveal the rival’s name, foreclosing the “why” mystery. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence) not visceral; no resource or relationship is forfeited on-page. Escalation is knowledge-based under causal lens; pressure plateaus once the ledger is read.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of light-in-darkness (glass luminosity, starlight, frost shine) rather than statement. Final image—“stars faded, but their light echoed”—offers quiet Conceptual Repricing, equating inner glow with cosmic resonance. Avoids overt moralizing; no thesis sentence. Subtext remains thin because rivalry motive is told, not dramatized, reducing thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“luminous glass artist,” “patterns in morning frost”—is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within artisan lexicon; no academic drift. Compression in early beats (“chaos,” “flames and shouts”) is purposeful, taught by context. Closure line carries charged poise without syntactic stumble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., “scorched testament” fuses object + metaphor). One paraphrase loop detected: “she had retraced…to retrace the events” within 30 words; minor, does not obscure causality. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for frost observation, clipped for逃生 memory—matching tempo shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fusion of glass-art craft with smuggler-ledger noir is fresh, but rival-as-villain is familiar trope lightly sketched. Frost-as-code idea is elegant and specific to artist gaze, elevating ingenuity. Conceptual repricing at end (“scorched testament” = self) feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; no structural experimentation, but premise synthesis is memorable.</comment>
