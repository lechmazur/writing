<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara/Aeliana’s interior contradiction—steel-armored empathy—remains embodied in every beat: the gauntlet scrape, the tessera warmth, the whispered rename. The retrocognitive trap is not a label; it forces her to kneel and touch the stone, driving the plot. The rename costs her old identity on the page, crystallizing a new stance with visible price. No other character appears, so relational bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority is specific, conflicted, and drives the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the mosaic tessera and stepping-stone patterns accrue meaning until the rename reweights identity. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aeliana stands, sky no longer a wound but canvas, cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Pattern is taught early (shattered sky, warm coldness) and paid off in last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The minaret tessera and stepping stone function as micro-setting: their tactile details constrain every choice—kneeling, tracing, renaming. Shattered sky shifts from wound to canvas in the final image, recharging earlier motif. “Warm coldness” is filtered through Elara’s perception, not a weather report. Spatial choreography is clean: plaza heart → kneel → rise → exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can empathy survive after the fire? Pressure tightens when the retrocognitive trap forces physical interaction with the mosaic; the rename narrows options to one—Aeliana must carry the cost. No external antagonist; escalation is textural density of pattern and memory. Visible price: loss of prior identity, tessera clutched like a shard of self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: a single cobalt-gold tessera survives, proving beauty can persist in armor. “Aberrant mercy” is not stated but enacted—the universe allows the rename without forgiving the fire. Final image reweights the premise: empathy is the strongest steel. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate POV stays locked; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: “warm coldness,” “steel-clad arms folded not in aggression,” “shattered sky.” Syntax shortens under retrocognitive surge, mirroring trapped pulse. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent, character-specific, and modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies: long sentences for lingering ash-heat, fragments for surge spikes. No synonym churn or template cadence. “Warm coldness” is a deliberate oxymoron taught early; payoff in final line. Information density high—each sentence advances image or interiority. One minor loop: “shattered sky” appears three times within 60 words mid-story; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Freshens post-apocalypse trope by focusing on a single tessera rather than panoramic ruin. Retrocognitive trap as physical compulsion to touch art is non-obvious. Rename via mosaic pattern rather than ritual speech feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: quiet lyric closure could feel soft, but cost is made visible by clutched shard and identity loss.</comment>
