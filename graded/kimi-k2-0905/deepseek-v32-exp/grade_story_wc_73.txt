<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly precision vs. dice-rolled daring—stays alive in every micro-choice; the chipped die pressed into her thumb is a tactile emblem of that flaw. The final turn from capturing a lost moment to accepting its transformation is foreshadowed by the die’s imbalance, so the renunciation feels earned. One slip: “grim optimism” is named repeatedly but never shown through bodily tension or contradictory gesture until late; a single diagnostic label mid-crisis costs the 0.3 that keeps it below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is anchored by line 3; causality is accumulative-textural—each step-dice-roll-equals equation thickens the pattern until the crack ruptures it. Closure lands as Charged Poise: perpetual motion redefined as courage within limits, the die pointing a new direction with visible conceptual cost (“the boundless confinement was her own making”). No orientation debt, no lens drift; the mathematical symbols glowing underfoot externalize the proof and pay off the premise. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence: “the infinite staircase became her home, not her prison.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase itself is tool and environment: its cold stone, the crack that “shatters the seamless continuity,” and the glowing symbols constrict her choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent—visual glare of equations, tactile sharpness of the die chip—never tourist-catalog. Micro-setting success: the die chip literally tilts the roll that feeds the proof that breaks the step, so object-as-setting constrains tactics. Without the staircase’s perfect sameness the rupture would lack contrast; without the chip the random variable fails—both are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible by line 4: “capture the texture of a missed opportunity.” Pressure tightens via pattern accumulation—each solved equation raises the implicit cost of never finding the rupture. The rupture itself is the single meaningful turn; it narrows options from conquest to acceptance, paid with the visible price of her prior framework fracturing. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, and fully serves the accumulative lens—no higher score only because the tightening is one-stage, yet that stage is flawless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the missed opportunity is not retrieved but metabolized—imperfection as engine of motion. The chipped die reappears at closure pointing a new path, reweighting the earlier motif from flaw to compass. No moralizing, only image; the reader is left balancing optimism and confinement. Complexity is intact: she wins by surrendering to incompleteness, a counter-intuitive insight that feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual signature—mathematical metaphors, tactile dice, narrow focus on stone underfoot. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for spiral ascent, staccato fragments at the crack—“Mathematical symbols glowed.” No head-hopping, no filter-verb chains. Diction skews cerebral (“stochastic element,” “lemmas”) yet stays plausible for a scholar in crisis; voice is distinctive without showy pyrotechnics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “She adjusted her approach, her daring balanced by the rigid logic of theorems and lemmas” advances plot, character, theme. Occasional template echo: “every step was a variable, every landing a constant” is allowed as pattern-teaching parallelism. Metaphors stay coherent (staircase as formula, die as entropy). No loops, no scaffold, final third clean—only a hairline slip of elevated register in “conceptual repricing” keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Infinite staircase + perpetual motion + math proofs is familiar surreal troika, yet the synthesis feels fresh: the proofs are not MacGuffin but lived phenomenology, the crack is not escape but perspective flip. Chipped die as embodiment of uncertainty-beauty is a specific, non-obvious inflection. Risk taken: lyric repetition of “grim optimism” could have flattened into gimmick, instead it modulates into hope at the close. Transformation test fails—swap die for coin or staircase for hallway and the emotional calculus collapses, confirming originality.</comment>
