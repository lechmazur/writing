<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poet’s desire to “translate between generations” is stated early and his ritual of jarring sound gives him a distinctive vocation, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“old regrets and older hopes”) rather than dramatized in-scene; no moment shows him tempted to stop or to hoard a jar, so the arc is static rather than intensifying. The final beat—packing the jars and feeling “contentment”—is a summary label instead of an embodied cost or renunciation, so the change feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the semicircle of glowing jars reweights his identity from vagrant to “keeper,” with the conceptual cost that he must keep walking. Causality is light—the music-box simply yields when turned—but the accumulative pattern (each jar = one captured phrase) holds together and the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The price is legible yet abstract—no imminent external consequence—so the effect is poetic but not fully freighted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Driftwood-and-grass loft, salt-crusted air, and scattered-gold light are vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet’s salt-stung senses; the micro-setting (music-box, jars) functions as tactile tools that constrain every micro-choice. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating props. The dunes’ whispered secrets return in the final paragraph to charge the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and singular: can he redeem himself by preserving lost sound? Pressure accumulates through the repetition of jar-capture, each note tightening the ritual, but no external obstacle or escalating risk raises the cost; the music-box cooperates at once. The tightening is lyrical (density of dawn-light imagery) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens but lacking a visible price that forecloses an option. Agency is present yet safe—he never drops a jar, never confronts a rival, so escalation feels gentle, not perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as personal atonement. The music-box’s silence and the jars’ sealed songs create a subtle metaphor for memory vs. erasure, never stated outright. Final image of “pocket full of captured dawns” offers a non-literal reconfiguration of value—redemption reframed as portable archive—avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity remains: we sense the cost of perpetual wandering without exposition, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a wistful cadence with controlled metaphor (“scattered gold,” “choir of silenced voices”) that matches the poet’s temperament; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates—long breathy sentences for dawn hush, single-clause bursts for the turning key—without rhythmic monotony. Perceptual signature is consistent: salt, rust, and woodgrain noticed through a vagrant’s calloused fingertips. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within reach of a self-taught poet, avoiding academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong auditory and tactile specificity (“frail, halting tune,” “glass cool against calloused fingers”) and high information density—most sentences layer action, image, and emotional charge. Occasional overwriting: two adjacent “old regrets and older hopes” + “positively wistful” repeat the same emotional abstract; “lonesome splendor” appears three times with diminishing returns, creating synonym churn. No mixed metaphors, but template cadence in “He… then he…” runs across three sentences in the capture sequence. These loops stay clear of the closure beat, so momentum survives but 9-band is disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sonic-preservation premise feels fresh: a vagrant bard who literally traps sound in mason jars to redeem himself from obscurity. The fusion of apothecary-alchemist with seaside scavenger yields specific, grounded detail (salt-rimed jar rims, sand in the music-box gears). Risk is quiet—no steampunk spectacle—but the lyric accumulative structure commits fully, making the final “pocket full of captured dawns” feel inevitable in hindsight. Could edge higher if one jar had cracked, forcing a tangible sacrifice; as is, the ingenuity is conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>
