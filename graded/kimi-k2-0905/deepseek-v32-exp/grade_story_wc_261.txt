<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s scar-picking, insomnia-driven coffee-ring divination, and final acceptance of his plant-fusion wound give a coherent interior arc; the “closure seeker who only opens wounds” is dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choices (prying flagstone, urging roots) flow from the telepathic constraint. Cost is visible when he descends alone, abandoning the tower above. Motive stays character-bound; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the ivy signals “deep wrong stillness,” therefore Aris tunnels; because he tunnels, he finds the crystal that rewrites his accident. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: his scar shifts from wound to gateway, with the hourglass click as audible cost. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. One clean transition from cot to tunnel; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower dawn, ivy-clad stone, wet-clay scent, and the frost-hourglass micro-setting constrain every move; the loose flagstone is tactile pivot. Sensory hierarchy follows Aris’s plant-telepathy bias—root-thoughts replace visual catalog. Final image reuses “meteor hush,” now charged by the crystal’s glow, binding setting to theme. Spatial choreography tracks his body from cot → floor → tunnel → chamber without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can he read the silence beneath his pain? Each beat tightens: coffee rings → void → tunnel → crystal revelation, foreclosing the option to stay above. Agency is continuous; roots respond only to his directed intent. Cost is literalized when the hourglass resumes, proving time—and healing—now advance on the tower’s terms, not his.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: scars as texts, displacement as insight. The crystal rewrites his accident from random trauma to deliberate initiation; narrative refuses to moralize. “Meteor hush” reprises as forgiving silence, reweighting trauma into vocation. Ambiguity lingers—he remains scarred, telepathic, alone—yet resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris; perceptual signature filters every image through vegetal telepathy (“leafy sigh,” “root-lights”). Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror root-tendril urgency. No head-hop; diction stays within a wounded insomniac’s range. Voice modulation from drowsy anesthetic haze to crystalline clarity mirrors plot arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density—“meteor hush” carries triple duty (tone, title, closure). Concrete nouns replace modifiers: “frosted hourglass,” “crystalline shard.” Rhythm accelerates across tunnel descent via short, enjambed clauses. No mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, taught early, and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of botanic telepathy + coffee-ring geomancy + hourglass stasis is fresh; none are placeholders. Displaced miracle premise commits fully—crystal is not MacGuffin but origin of his wound/insight. Risky lyric compression (“meteor hush”) succeeds because pattern is taught and recharged. Specificity prevents tropes from feeling recycled; insight is inseparable from this tower, this scar, this dawn.</comment>
