<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s calm-observer trait stays consistent, but the only micro-choice—lifting the glass and meditating—doesn’t force a trade-off or visible cost; the tears feel reported, not embodied contradiction. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; interiority is textured (“potter’s deliberate grace”) yet never truly jeopardized. The earned stasis is present thematically yet lacks a palpable price on his body or future, keeping the arc slightly under-cooked for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kindness-lantern accretes meaning until the final glow reweights the oasis. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lantern lifted, fractures mended “for a fleeting instant,” cost felt as transient fragility. Causality between ghost-scenes and present calm is more associative than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and lands cleanly; slight looseness keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desert, hives, smoke, and glass are filtered through a potter’s tactile eye; each detail performs double duty—world-building and interior state. The lantern glass constrains the final action and is charged in the last image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is declared early; pressure escalates via accumulating ghost-kindness tableaux rather than narrowing options. No concrete resource lost or foreclosed path; cost is purely contemplative, limiting escalation intensity. Agency is observational; fits Accumulative lens yet keeps tension lyrical, not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: kindness as temporal anchor. Final image of lantern light mending fractures offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext resides in tactile gestures—crumbling hive, thrum through bone—avoiding overt thesis. Complexity welcomed; no symmetry forced between decay and hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s calm, synesthetic perception; diction is potter-specific (“fractured timelines, like faulty pottery”). Rhythm breathes with daylight descent; no filter-verb clusters. Voice is distinctive enough, though syntactic variety is moderate; slight reserve prevents 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is spare and integrated (“sharp gentleness”) without metaphor pile-ups. Sentence variation supports meditative tempo; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Minor opportunities for even crisper verbs, hence not 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.4</question><comment>Fusing Zen potter, bee-ghosts, and kindness-as-phototropism yields fresh angle on eco-ghost story. Concept of kindness fixing time fractures is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off; no derivative echoes. Specificity of hive textures and lantern glow keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
