<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The guardian’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the library yet embracing the garden—are held in embodied, scene-level tension; the final renunciation of return is earned by the prior absorption of cold/mist. Interiority stays concrete (“pendant hums,” “ice glyphs”) rather than abstract. The flaw: no second character means status/relationship bullets are moot, so the arc is purely intra-subjective; still, micro-choices (grip pendant, step into between) carry visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: pendant shatters, boundaries dissolve, guardian becomes the uncertainty—cost is the irreversible loss of dimensional home. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each “interiorizing exteriors” beat thickens the mist/light density until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (who, where, when). The slight bump: causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but that is chosen lens; still, the price is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden, skeletal branches, shifting mist, and the pendant’s evolving temperature are returned to in almost every paragraph, constraining stance (cannot rush, must absorb). Micro-setting rule satisfied: pendant-as-tool charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to cold/hum/ice-glyph visual under crisis. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent across the single slow step.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is crystallized early: “make friends with uncertainty.” Escalation is textural—each absorption increases the guardian’s forfeiture of return option until stepping into the between forecloses library forever. Agency is renunciation rather than deed; cost is the felt ache of dimensional homelessness made companion. One meaningful tightening suffices for 700-word lyric arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive imagery: mist, light-boundaries, pendant, waiting—each reweighted at shattering moment. No moralizing; final image (“became the mist, the light”) is oblique answer to how to befriend uncertainty. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting counter-readings (is this death, dream, transcendence?). Epiphany is earned through bodily absorption rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, compressed, patterned anaphora (“It waited…”) that teaches its cadence early and pays off in final clause shift (“It waited no longer”). Perceptual signature is guardian-sensory: cold metal, ice-coated fur, glyph-seeing. Diction stays inside plausible feral-mystic lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue absent—no penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and openers; repetition is purposeful (anaphora) not template cadence. No mixed metaphors; “interiorized the exteriors” is own coined phrase, consistent. High density: each sentence layers cold/mist/light. Minor loop: “the guardian interiorized…” appears twice with near-identical phrasing; costs −0.2 but does not touch closure beat. Final line lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dimensional ex-library feral absorbing winter garden to befriend uncertainty is non-obvious synthesis. Pendant-as-key that requires total self-dissolution reframes familiar “threshold object.” Risk: lyric stasis could feel repetitive, but payoff reconfigures pattern into oneness. Specificity of cold glyphs, pendant hum, and mist-mirror keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
