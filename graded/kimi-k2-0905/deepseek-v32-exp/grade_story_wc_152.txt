<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “wise-fool” duality drives every beat: the muttered milk line dupes the captain while her needle silently re-stitches power. Interiority stays concrete—blood on thread, flame reflected in silver—never sliding into label-speak. The final renunciation (extinguishing the Eternal Flame) is earned because her earlier sightings of guard-complicity have foreclosed every safer path. Cost is visible: she accepts irreversible darkness in exchange for the kingdom’s last chance.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snuffed candle reweights every prior glimmer of light into threat. Causal chain holds—each tug of thread reveals guard betrayal that in turn forces her to blow the flame. Under Accumulative lens, the candle’s extinction is the pattern-break that makes the tapestry’s new constellation legible. Orientation anchored by word 60—“Cobalt Observatory courtyard”—and never drifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The Eternal Candle operates as micro-setting: its niche-height and wavering shadow dictate what Elara can and cannot be seen stitching, directly shaping stealth tactics. Autumn leaves “skittering across stone” are filtered through her need to hear footfalls; sound replaces postcard visuals. Spatial choreography is clean—hoop, niche, doorway form a straight sight-line the captain’s gaze can travel. Final image of absolute darkness is charged by its earlier role as sole source of permanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent unnamed coup—tightens when embroidery reveals the guard’s complicity, moving risk from abstract to personal. One meaningful deepening: flame flickers not from draft but from her revealed truth, signalling that knowledge itself endangers her. Cost is felt: she trades the kingdom’s symbol of continuity (light) for a half-chance warning, foreclosing her own safety. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only the final crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge is a combustible resource—light to see, flame to burn the knower. The candle’s shift from comforting constant to liability reweights every earlier mention without authorial commentary. No moralizing; the kingdom may still fall, the embroidery may never be read. Resonance lingers in the reader’s newly darkened observatory, forced to “listen” as Elara does.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s needle-centric perception: constellations are “trouble,” threads “tangle,” sound is “skitter.” Syntax tightens into fragments under pressure—“No more time for listening; the time for speaking had come.” No head-hopping; captain’s smirk is purely external, filtered through her risk calculation. Voice distinguishes her double register—public babble versus precise stellar cartography—without slipping into explanatory exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates across the final third: clauses shorten, verbs strengthen—“She had to act.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new causal or tactile detail. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“shadows that mimicked constellations”—never crowding urgency. Line-level artifacts zero; flame, thread, and darkness remain physically consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “galaxy-chart embroiderer” trope is re-animated through tactical embroidery: each stitch literally rewrites future politics. Adjacent-possibility method freshens standard spy splice—she tracks “almost was” conversations rather than stolen letters. Eternal Candle as ticking fuse reverses the usual everlasting light trope. Specificity of the Serpent’s Coil constellation prevents generic star-map vagueness.</comment>
