<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s monomaniacal drive to “compress eternity into a moment” is crisp, and her micro-choice to uncork the whisper is embodied (cold glass, visible ripple). Interiority stays concrete—frost patterns read as code, not metaphor sludge. The final renunciation—accepting ungovernable chaos—carries cost, though the pivot from ambition to caretaker feels telescoped; one more beat of visible regret would have pushed this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost glyphs → type-setting → uncorking → rupture, each stage thickens texture and reweights the library’s stability. The “luminous moment” beat delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost: the library is no longer an archive but a living storm. Orientation is taught early (“glass orchard library floated…”) so no penalty. Closure beat is present, felt, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard library is not postcard scenery—its crystalline branches chime under stress, constraining Elara’s movements and later twisting in response to the rupture. Sea-of-clouds exterior provides scale and constant motion, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: sound (chiming), touch (cold bottle), sight (frost vectors) all serve the beat. Meets 9+ gate: the setting’s metamorphosis directly shapes the closing cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over time—tightens through each accumulative shard: reading frost → setting type → uncorking → rupture. One meaningful deepening suffices; the “luminous moment” compresses all timelines and forecloses perfect-system stability forever. Cost is legible: the library’s groan and boiling clouds. No coincidence; escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—negotiated reality versus human hunger for stasis—emerges through images (frost, whisper, twisting glass) rather than exposition. Final image of “ever-changing frost” reweights the premise: knowledge is no longer fixed but perpetually becoming. Avoids sermon; the cost is the library’s lost perfection. Subtext in silence: the bottled whisper’s absence after rupture speaks louder than any moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—frost as code, books as fruit—without POV slippage. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer clause-stacked sentences before rupture, staccato fragments during (“Then came the rupture: a silent, profound split…”). No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“letterpress,” “glyphs”). Meets 9+ gate: rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “bottled whisper… glass surface misting over with the chill of contained potential” does world, object, and temperature in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (frost = code, books = fruit) and converge on the rupture. Minor register elevation (“luminous moment”) is earned by prior pattern; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of bibliophilia, quantum time, and arboreal architecture feels singular; not a trope mash-up but an organic system. Transformation test: swap glass trees for metal shelves and the entire symbolic and tactile logic collapses. Risky accumulative structure pays off: lyric repetition of frost patterns becomes the engine of climax. Fresh inflection—“rustling awakenings” as living index of reality re-negotiation—recharges familiar surreal-library trope.</comment>
