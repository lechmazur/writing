<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract (“mournful elation”); the bead-hand-off forces a single clear micro-choice, yet the ghost’s contradictory impulses stay summarized, not embodied in scene. Elian’s remembrance flood is told, not dramatized, so the cost feels declared rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ghost’s iterative cameos tighten mood until the bead transfer catalyzes resonant awakening—an earned RR with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric but coherent; closure image (“bead on the shelf”) reweights the premise without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse under endless night is more postcard than crucible, yet the bead-as-micro-setting finally constrains Elian’s future ritual, nudging the score high. Sensory selection favors luminous fruit and chill air—purposeful, not catalogic—though spatial choreography is lightly tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation via debt repayment—signals early; pressure escalates through denser visitations, not reversals. The bead hand-off crystallizes the trade-off under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible as her dissolution and his solitary continuance, but no tangible price alters his tactics afterward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of love-as-debt emerges via recurring bead and luminous fruit rather than statement. Final image reframes orchard as living memorial—quiet CR—yet a touch of sentimental closure (“her love remained”) softens the edge, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elian’s perceptual filter: selective attention to glow, chill, whispered leaves. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but leaf-rustle diction suits ghost’s cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet disciplined: no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant awakenings spread”) skirts purple but remains in POV lexicon. High information density; rhythm breathes with scene temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Alchemical-orchard + ghost-bride debt is a fresh synthesis; tropes are tilted, not recycled. Risk lies in lyric stasis, yet the bead payoff justifies the pattern. Could travel farther from stock gothic imagery, but specificity of endless-night greenhouse keeps it memorable.</comment>
