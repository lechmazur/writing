<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—chastity against insurgence—is dramatized in each micro-choice; the courtesan label is shown through her practiced stillness, not told. The “final, decisive pull” on the obedience-thread visibly forfeits her citadel safety, earning her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lullaby → courtyard → harvest → sanctuary → rewritten self. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—her breath no longer answers to the citadel’s cadence—landing under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Snow-silvered courtyard is both stage and snare; every sensory pick is filtered through courtesan training (noticing reflection, silence, footprints). The prism light at the end re-illuminates earlier “spectral threads,” recharging the setting image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. obedience—tightens as each thread she pulls rings a real laugh or tear, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: the final thick thread snaps, unlocking the sanctuary and trading safety for authorship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of authored vs. scripted self emerges through the echo-harvest; no moralizing line spells it out. The closing “story now her own to write” is earned by the literal rewriting of internal light, giving resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric compressions (“breath forming pale ghosts”) teach the pattern early; perceptual signature stays consistent—Elara thinks in performance metaphors. Syntax swells/shortens with thread tension; no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High-density lines do triple duty (world-building, interiority, metaphor); no scaffold loops. A single mixed image—“alarming serenity”—is flagged, but it is intentional oxymoron, not figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar “courtesan revolts” trope is freshened by prism-as-unwritten-archive and the untangling mechanic. Risk resides in lyric abstraction, but internal logic stays coherent; not transformative, yet memorable.</comment>
