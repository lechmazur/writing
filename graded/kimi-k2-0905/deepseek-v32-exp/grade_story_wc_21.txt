<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is strong—Elara’s solemn duty and the visceral cost of bearing painful truth land cleanly. The flaw: her one on-page choice (decoding) is causally foreshadowed but not visibly paid for; no endurance or forfeiture is dramatized, so the “change” feels more revelation than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: letters → diary → retrocognitive trap → debris cipher → diary decrypted → truth owned. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s quiet “earned stasis” in the zeppelin library forecloses the comfort of sanitized history; cost is the irreversible knowledge she now carries, shown in the final image of her staring at clouds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and floating library are not postcard backdrops; both constrain action—lagoon supplies the cipher medium, library supplies the archival mission. Sensory economy is disciplined: “grains of sand between her toes” and “zeppelin humming” are filtered through Elara’s archivist attention, anchoring body and tool while charging the final image of clouds that now “contain” the hidden dunes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she accept the painful truth?”—tightens once: the diary’s glow makes refusal impossible. Escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than causal-combative; cost is conceptual (she can never unread the compromises) and is legible in the closing beat where she shoulders the “weight of it.” One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: the debris-cipher literalizes how marginalized voices had to encode truth in detritus. Final image—clouds over invisible dunes—re-prices the premise: official history is a thin veil above buried moral complexity. No moralizing statement; resonance is visual and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, solemn, archivist-cool: “she thought about the parley, the negotiation with the past” carries disciplinary diction without drift. Rhythm quickens only inside the vision—“the diary’s pages began to glow”—then settles back to library hush, mirroring her return to stasis. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative control precise: “obsidian lagoon” and “sheet of black glass” reinforce without contradiction. One near-miss: “searing reverie” appears twice; the repetition is purposeful but edges toward thesis-label, a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of civil-rights archive work with retrocognitive beach-cipher feels inevitable yet fresh; the lagoon-as-code-key transforms a familiar activism trope into sensory praxis. Risk—lyric time-slip inside a single shard—pays off by making historical erasure physically inhabitable. Specificity of “driftwood, shells, sea glass” as encryption medium is irreplaceable; swap to any other code and the emotional archaeology collapses.</comment>
