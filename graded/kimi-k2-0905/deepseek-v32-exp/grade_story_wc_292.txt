<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s ancestor-fixation is vivid, but her present-tense interiority thins to label-speak (“spongey dread”) and recycled “nervously confident.” The copper-nail beats give her two decisive micro-choices that visibly cost composure, yet the station scenes still read as exposition-heavy summary rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: coded stanzas → coordinates → dive → nail → exoneration, each link visible on-page. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost (ancestral shame reversed). One soft spot: the false-mutiny reveal is delivered in a single expository lump instead of being discovered through tightened choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weather-station micro-setting is sketched with tight, purposive sensory picks (whirring sensors, thin charged air) that constrain access to data and dive tech. The submerged coffin plank is a textbook micro-setting-as-object that charges the final image. One clarity slip: spatial ground between archive console, lab, and storm window drifts during the probe coordination beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clear ancestor’s name—locks early and tightens once: the nail must be retrieved before the committee meets. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; no coin-flip resolutions. Cost is legible (reputation, emotional stamina), though the climax could sharpen a tangible loss (time, equipment, social credit) to push the score into the 8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of historical erasure vs. personal witness emerges implicitly through the nail’s reweighting from cryptic clue to legal proof, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in Elara’s curt question to the committee carries satisfying dramatic irony. Final image of “shifting winds” is a mildly generic metaphoric echo that keeps the piece just shy of resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is cleanly map-librarian (coordinate fixation, metadata instinct). Rhythm modulates—short staccato under alarm blares, longer cadence during archive scrolls—without monotony. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Roy’s gruff idiom contrasts Elara’s clipped precision. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; few scaffold sentences. One paraphrase loop (“spongey dread… spongey weight”) and a near-filter stack (“she felt the dread intensify”) dull immediacy in precisely the climax beat, blocking 8+ entry. Otherwise strong verb choices, concrete nouns, no mixed metaphors, and punctuation clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: maritime-code poetry + climate-science station + post-jet-stream drowned courtroom fuses into a premise that feels inevitable yet new. Copper nail as both forensic evidence and poetic symbol transforms familiar ancestor-redemption arc. Risk is moderate but coherent; no derivative-template echo. Specificity of navigational stanzas sells the concept.</comment>
