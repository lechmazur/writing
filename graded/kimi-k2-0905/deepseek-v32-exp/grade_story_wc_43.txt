<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elara’s calm, decisive kindness is dramatized through micro-choices—smoothing sheets, choosing the shard, guiding the recording—each tethered to her goal of a painless farewell. Alistair’s memories and forgiveness are similarly embodied, not declared. The only softness is that his interiority late (“renewed peace”) drifts toward label; still, the characterization sustains the stakes and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: shard → memories → recorded message → final embrace, each beat deepening the farewell’s texture. Orientation is anchored by clause 3; the single transition (door-open for Lena) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken vinyl on the bedside reweights “flawless goodbye” with felt cost—fragments can equal wholeness. No causality breaks, though the exact clock of decline stays impressionistic rather than tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mountain hospice above clouds is sketched lightly—window, terrace jasmine, tea steam—but every detail is filtered through Elara’s therapeutic gaze and nudges choice (jasmine triggers Mahler memory). Spatial choreography stays clean across bed / window / recorder. The shard micro-setting constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor slip: altitude never affects breathing or logistics, a tiny verisimilitude miss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye before death”—is signaled early and tightens through each song fragment and the recorded apology; escalation is the narrowing of remaining breath. Cost is felt: Alistair’s last afternoon asks for the music he can no longer dance to. Agency is shared: Elara enables, Alistair speaks the forgiveness; both endure the final silence. No external antagonist needed; internal countdown supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: broken things (vinyl, family, body) can still carry whole meanings. No moralizing line tells this; the final image of the shard beside the stopped breath reconfigures the premise. Subtext lives in gesture—handing the vinyl to Lena wordlessly apologizes for decades of silence. The scent of hope threads through but never announced as symbol; its last whiff is earned atmosphere, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: clinical gentleness, musical cadence, sensory economy. Syntax modulates—long breath-like sentences during hymning, then clipped clauses at death. No head-hop; Alistair’s interior accessed only via observable relief and smile. Dialogue sparse, natural, subtext-heavy (“Clara and I danced…”). No filter-verb clusters or register drift; prose breathes with the pulsing stillness it describes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density high—single sentences layer action, memory, scent. Metaphors (vinyl = reunification) stay consistent and physically rooted. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending the arc. One tiny scaffold: “the scent of hope…seemed to grow stronger” uses seemed where direct perception would be stronger; not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice trope is refreshed through “hymning the mundane” as medical practice and the broken-vinyl reunification metaphor. The above-clouds sanctuary risks postcard kitsch yet stays functional as a liminal space where music and breath thin out. Risk taken: no medical jargon or crisis melodrama; quiet accumulation carries the stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable—shard becomes token of wholeness—fulfilling the 9+ quick test despite tonal restraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup first paragraph; development via every song-choice and the apology recording; closure linkage—she pockets the shard and watches the sky, bearing the cost of serial goodbyes. Decisive kindness narrows her tactics and exacts emotional toll. Irreplaceable: only a serene musician-therapist could hymn breathing into farewell.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Appears paragraph 4, handled again at hand-off, final bedside image. Each return reweights meaning: music fragment → memory → reconciliation → relic of death. Causes two tactical turns (request recording, final music request). Closure charged by its untouched broken edge. Could not swap with any intact object—fracture is the point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Introduced early as jasmine-rain mix, recurs as “lingering” final note. Modulates tone but does not constrain tactics; more atmosphere than pressure. Still, its progression from floral aroma to intangible emotional aftermath reweights the goodbye, earning mid-plus mark.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Trait is not label-only: causes her to initiate recording, cede farewell timing to patient, absorb psychic weight. Cost visible when she steps back “heart full,” quietly shouldering cumulative grief. Swappable word would change nuance, not structure, so stops short of top tier.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reunify drives every beat—vinyl shard reunites Alistair with memory, then with Lena, then with music at death. Dictation scene is decisive turn; final embrace crystallizes it. Could not swap synonym without rewriting narrative spine. Cost paid by dying breath.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Method taught early and mechanics matter: Elara sings breathing rhythms, tea steam, sunlight angles—each converts mundane into palliative music. Shapes middle tactics and stakes; without it, the farewell would feel generic ritual, not bespoke therapy. Final stillness echo returns the hymn as silence, closing loop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Setting supplies liminal atmosphere and symbolic altitude but never pressures logistics or choices; altitude never taxes lungs, clouds never block helicopter, etc. Works as tonal canvas, not constraint. Needed for mood yet structurally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Blood-work confirmation anchors terminal countdown; implied days-hours scale governs urgency to record message and play symphony. Time isn’t granular, but “final afternoon” delivers felt deadline. Removing it would dissipate tension, so earns solid mid-high score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Motivation propels every Elara move and is dramatized, not told: she smooths sheet, chooses shard, sets recorder, cues Mahler. Conflict between flawless ideal and inevitable pain costs her private grief she never vocalizes. Drives closure—she pockets shard as proof of success and perpetual reminder of imperfection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Pulsing stillness is seeded paragraph 1, modulates across beats—quiet intensifies during dictation, vibrates in father-daughter embrace, hushes at last breath. Charges final image: silent room after music ends. Tone is story’s heartbeat; remove it and the lyric cadence collapses.</comment>
