<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past/future sight) are dramatized in the dream-interpretation beats; the final renunciation—stepping into the storm as “part of the flow”—is earned by the seal-dissolution beat that forecloses her keeper role. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“grit etching lines beside her eyes”). No second character, so status crucible waived; micro-choices (stone placement, pressing seal to wall) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: directive crumbles on-page, identity as keeper lost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wall-become-gateway reweights every prior echo of path vs. walker. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-images and seal-dust accrues until meaning flips. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“vine-draped bunker”). No causality break; the seal’s dissolution is the engine, not luck. Persistent constraint: the decaying directive shapes each micro-choice until it vanishes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bunker-as-micro-setting constrains light, sound, movement; vines scrape metal door at exact moment of internal shift, marrying outside storm to inner flip. Concrete dust + ozone + wet earth triangulates sensory space. The seal-as-threshold object is handled in three tactile beats (vision, pulse, dust) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—tightens once: dream-merge reveals resonance rule, foreclosing her old keeper agency. Escalation is textural density: each dream-stone adds pressure until seal flakes; storm arrival externalizes the flip. Cost legible—loss of directive, identity, shelter. No coincidence; storm complicates but catalyst is her interpretive act.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: seal dust = path dust, both threshold and dissolution. No explicit moral; final image is wind-woven truth. Ambiguity survives—she is both chosen and chooser. Resonant reconfiguration reweights “decaying directive” from burden to release without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside her arcane perceptual filter: “echoes of what was and the shimmer of what might be” teaches the dual-sight pattern. Rhythmic control: long lyrical clauses compress into staccato beats (“It dissolved”). Zero head-hopping. Diction stays within mystic-scout lexicon; no register drift. Filter verbs (“she saw”) are voice-motivated, not slack.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform atmosphere, interiority, and plot beat (“She pressed the disintegrating wafer seal…wall shimmered”). No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (storm-as-catalyst, not destruction). Rhythm breathes with pressure—sentence length contracts at gateway moment. Clean grammar; opening line anchors voice and stake.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshened trope: post-apocalyptic bunker becomes living seed-pod; oracle trope inverted—she learns the path already chose her. Synthesis of past/future sight feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in charged image. Specific detail—“ethereal grit”—creates signature texture unlikely in another story.</comment>
