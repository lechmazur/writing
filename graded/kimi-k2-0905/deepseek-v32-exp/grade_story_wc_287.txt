<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” lens is consistently voiced and her inherited gauge-tooth grounds her motive, yet the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“ache of loss deep in her bones”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The nightly outing is ritual, not risky; no tool-choice or mirror-angle actually fails, so the arc is circular affirmation rather than a paid cost. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and the final beat of noticing the green bud offers a micro-earned stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each oar-stroke layers calm, the mirror-beam re-weights the same dark cliff, and the rose-petal frame returns as Conceptual Repricing—loss is re-priced as invitation. Causality is loose (no lock actually resists her) but the pattern is taught early and closure lands with luminous cost. Orientation is secure by line 4; transitions are smooth within the single contiguous window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Harbor, moon, and cliff crevice are filtered through Elara’s gardener eye; the polished mirror and slick dock-post are tactile, choice-guiding objects. Spatial choreography is clean—fire-escape descent to rowboat to cliff-shadow—and the setting’s silver sheet directly enables her light-instilling tactic. The mirror-as-tool satisfies the 9+ gate: it constrains the final image by literally directing the beam that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“instill light into dark corners”—is signaled early but never truly endangered; escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than option-narrowing. The rhythmic oars calm her thoughts but do not test or foreclose a path; the mirror routine succeeds without resistance. Cost is present only as conceptual ache, not a visible forfeiture, so pressure remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal emerges through rose petal → bare branch → green bud and mirrored light returning to sender, avoiding explicit moral. The concept of “protected vulnerability” is enacted by the harbor hush that blankets her ritual, not stated. Subtext resides in the gauge-tooth’s unused teeth: potential never risked. Final image offers quiet CR—darkness is never absolute—but the insight is gentle, not searing.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close stays tightly fused to Elara’s gardener perceptions (“skeletal frame of the rosebush,” “sea-damp post”) with rhythmic sentence variation that mimics oar-cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged by internal idiom alone; the wistful/pragmatic tension shows in syntax that pairs “accepting this ending” with “ache of loss.” Filter verbs are minimal; the prose breathes with intentional pauses that suit moonlit ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary and no scaffold loops stall momentum. Figurative language is selective—“sheet of silver,” “fragile cloak”—and does not clutter the high-pressure mirror beat. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous harbor,” “quivering hush”) fits the lyric register but keeps within Elara’s reflective lexicon. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, emotional state, and tool history.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The “fire-escape gardener” niche and lock-tooth heirloom are fresh specificities, yet the plot arc—row out, shine light, row back—follows a familiar restorative ritual pattern. Conceptual turn from petal-fall to bud-promise is anticipated; risk is muted. The mirror-as-instrument reweights darkness, but the insight feels gently earned rather than inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of harbor horticulture lifts it above generic eco-meditation.</comment>
