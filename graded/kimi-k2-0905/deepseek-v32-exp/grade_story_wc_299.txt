<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is mostly label-speak (“hollow quiet,” “wavered about his own worth”) and loops the same emotional note; the grille-cloth micro-choice is repeated but never alters tactics. No contradictory impulse plays out in scene; the shift to music-memorabilia niche is declared, not dramatized. Earned cost is missing—failure is off-page yesterday, today he simply decides “I think I know what to do.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is thin: yesterday’s public failure → today’s brooding → Mara’s visit → instant pivot. Closure is a declared intention, not a visible trade-off; no persistent constraint or price shapes the final image. Orientation is clear, but the decisive change happens in narrative summary, not on-page action. Drive lens is situational, yet pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Quarry trailer is sketched with dusty specificity and body-in-space cues; the grille cloth functions as micro-setting that finally charges the wall. Sensory selection stays tight to Leo’s audio-tuned eye. No object or place constrains a choice in real time, so 9+ gate fails. Environment is atmospheric but passive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes (professional redemption vs. echo-valley longing) are stated early yet neither escalates nor is tested; no concrete obstacle or ticking clock appears. The single pressure point is Mara’s empathy, which Leo instantly deflects and then abandons. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed; the pivot to music memorabilia is risk-free. Escalation is static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of “after the applause” is overtly named twice, edging into thematic echo penalty. Emergence relies on abstract nouns (“purpose,” “loss”) rather than charged particulars. Final image of framed cloth is pleasant but conceptually light—no reweighting of social or emotional cost. Subtext remains thin; insight is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays consistently inside Leo’s audio-boy perceptual filter; diction (“Marshall cabinet,” “echo valley”) is character-specific. Rhythm leans toward template cadence (“He… He…”) and repetitive anaphora that flattens urgency. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Mara’s voice distinct enough. Voice control holds, but lacks compressive punch under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Scaffold loops (“after the applause,” “insulating emotionally”) and near-paraphrase stacks dull momentum. Metaphors are safe (“tangible echo,” “ashes of failure”) and occasionally mixed (“echo valley longing”). Information density is moderate; several sentences could be cut without loss. Rhythm is regular to the point of monotony; final line lands cleanly but without sonic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Hybrid roadie-appraiser identity is fresh angle; music-memorabilia niche offers market potential. Grille cloth as keepsake key is nicely specific. Execution, however, follows a familiar recovery template without surprising turns. Risks are emotional, not structural; concept exceeds delivery. Insight feels generically uplifting rather than uniquely earned.</comment>
