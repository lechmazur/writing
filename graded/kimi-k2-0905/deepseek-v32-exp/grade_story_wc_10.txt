<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor-guilt engine is clear and embodied; the fork-against-palm micro-choice shows contradictory impulse (penance vs. creation). Static gesture repetition (“rectify” hammered 6×) flattens interior hierarchy; no new micro-choice after midpoint. Still, her final charged poise—viewing the color-symphony she alone can “hear”—earns renunciation cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each silent fork-strike layers color-density toward the RR final image. Orientation clean by 80 words; conservatory rules stable. Mid-scene flashback block (capsizing) is >20 % but anchored to fork-on-forehead cue and tilts present goal, so BRR safe. Closure legible: silence-canvas reweighted to music-without-sound; cost is irrevocable solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Winterglass panes, frost-etched flora, and dye-ripple physics are specific, tactile, and filter every action. Bench, piano, and fork case act as micro-settings that constrain choices (cut strings prevent acoustic escape). Final shimmer of mapped frost recharges opening lattice—environment directly charges the RR image. No spatial drift; cold consistently slows motion, matching reflective tempo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into perceivable music—tightens through color-intensification beats; each fork strike raises saturation cost (one live option foreclosed: she can never share audible music). No external antagonist; pressure is internal-material. Escalation is accumulative: scarlet→azure→violet→gold ripple; pattern break at piano (no strings) deepens constraint. Price visible: permanent sensory exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges tacitly: silence as generative canvas, grief transmuted into non-verbal art. Heat-map colors carry subtext of survivor’s PTSD without naming it. Final image reframes prior “emptiness” as plenitude—conceptual repricing with cost. No moralizing; marvels remain “unshaken,” underscoring endurance motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close; perceptual signature cold, glass-brittle, color-obsessed. Syntax lengthens during reflection, fractures under fork-strike beats—rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Free-indirect blends cleanly; “rectify” repetition is rhetorical pattern, not accidental loop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary. Information density high—one line often fuses sensory, emotional, symbolic work. Figurative layering risks purple drift in para-4 (“silence fell like a permanent shroud”), but pattern is taught early and pays off. Two paraphrase loops (“unshaken marvels” 3×, “rectify” 6×) dull momentum; −0.4 keeps closure intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-acoustic world, visual music—is non-obvious synthesis. Tuning fork as paint-brush, piano as mute easel: fresh repurposing. Risk of lyric repetition accepted and mostly earned. Core arc could not swap names/places without breaking frost-color mechanics. No derivative templates detected.</comment>
