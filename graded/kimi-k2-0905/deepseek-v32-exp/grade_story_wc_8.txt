<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“cold and sharp” anger) and her micro-choice—photographing the hidden veritas—caps her arc with visible cost. The parallel-drawing method is declared, not dramatized in scene, so agency feels intellectual rather than pressured. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her competence is high but the emotional rationality trait never complicates or jeopardizes her, muting internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rose petal drop → Elara begins; veritas find → truth rescued. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the letter’s meaning flips, honor redeemed, station now “gateway.” Cost is present but light—no personal jeopardy, only professional satisfaction. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no ambiguity or disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Station and ivy function as micro-setting: the decayed platform mirrors buried truth, the thorny bare rosebush supplies the final image of painful necessity. Sensory triad—damp earth, rust, gold leaf—filtered through historian’s curator eye. Space is sketched, not tracked, but single-character focus forgives choreography. Environment shapes mood more than tactical choice, capping 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore scribe’s honor—clear early. Escalation is informational (decoding letter) without tightening options or visible price; no live opposition or risk. Agency is cerebral; the “rescue” succeeds once veritas is photographed—no trade-off or lost path. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, staying below 7.0 threshold for high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: noble lies versus necessary truth, mirrored in Elara’s past silence. Subtext lives in the hidden veritas foliage—scribe’s whisper across centuries. Final image of thorny rosebush offers resonant Conceptual Repricing: truth hurts but protects. No moralizing; complexity acknowledged when Elara equates her small complicity with the scribe’s grand sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, academic-lyric: “emotionally rational mind cataloging the decay,” “silent scream against the falsehood.” Syntax varies; no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within historian’s lexicon; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature in how she reads Latin ambiguity and ivy patterns. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer decay, stake, and historical analogy. Figurative language is controlled—“green shroud,” “stubborn bloom”—no mixed metaphors. No loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts clean. Final line lands with thorn/image payoff. Minor scaffold: “her work had brought her here” could compress, but momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Historian redeems medieval scribe via modern parallel is fresh angle; rosebush clock and veritas graffiti avoid cliché. Risk is moderate—quiet interior puzzle, no thriller stakes—but specificity of illuminated-letter forensics feels authentic. Could swap stations but not the letter-ivy-rose triad, giving medium irreplaceability. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
