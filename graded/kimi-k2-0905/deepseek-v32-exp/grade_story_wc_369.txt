<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s want to “discover what trees witness” is lyric but never dramatized as an active choice under pressure; the mapping of dreams is the only tactical move and that action is narrated in summary, so no hierarchy of values is tested. The moon-heal trait is stated, not used at cost (she never risks staying in moonlight or fears cloud-cover). No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; interiority is delivered as thematic label (“quantified sorrow”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is a gentle diffusion, not a renunciation or crystallized stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sextant’s re-weighting and the sorrow’s dissolution are legible, and the final image carries felt conceptual cost. However, causality is loose—“the pin’s sound had been a catalyst” is asserted, not dramatized—and the dream-mapping mechanic is introduced late, so the because/therefore chain is more associative than causal under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 8; no penalty. The lens holds, but the tightening beat is off-stage (the pin clink) and therefore less earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower room, moonlit stone, and broken sextant are vividly sketched and filter through Elara’s technician gaze (“brass tarnished, mechanisms jammed”). Weather and light actively shift across beats, guiding her attention and mirroring internal softening. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The sextant as micro-setting constrains her final alignment act, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet the labyrinth itself—her daily workplace—remains off-page and thus less charged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deconstruct personal sorrow—stated early but never materially tested; no credible loss or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric (storm, moonlight) rather than option-narrowing; the pin clink is symbolic, not an obstacle that forecloses a path. Escalation is tonal accretion: storm subsides, sorrow dissolves—an accumulative cadence shift rather than agency-driven turn. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, so the tightening is present but gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Miracle-as-mundane emerges organically through the replacement of abstract grief with concrete village dreams; no moral is sermonized. The reprise of “trees witness” in the final line reweights the opening quest, offering a quiet conceptual repricing. Theme stays implicit, resisting tidy binaries; the sorrow is not cured but redistributed into ordinary living. The ending image invites reflection without sentimentality, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable and close to Elara’s technician perception; diction is concrete (“trimming hedges, cracked lens reflecting silver light”). No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for moonlit calm, clipped phrases at the pin clink. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are spare and POV-apt. The perceptual signature—measuring grief like hedge angles—feels particular and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density—each sentence layers image, tool, and emotional state. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Occasional elevated lyricism (“fragments of light, hidden truths”) borders on pattern without payoff, but it never muddies causality. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph cuts are purposeful, advancing from storm to tower to dawn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The sextant-as-emotion-astrolabe is a fresh twist on the broken-instrument trope; dream-mapping as cartography of sorrow feels idiosyncratic yet coherent. Combination of arbor-sentience with quantified grief is novel, but the “labyrinth worker” angle is under-exploited—no maze-specific peril or choice appears. Risk is lyrical rather than structural; the piece avoids cliché but does not push far beyond soft-fantasy template. Specificity of village dream fragments rescues the concept from abstraction.</comment>
