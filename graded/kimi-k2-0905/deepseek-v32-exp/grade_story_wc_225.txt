<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian’s self-loathing and need for absolution are viscerally embodied in his finger-fidgets and the way he treats the platinum labyrinth as both scourge and talisman. The interior contradiction—pride in his old mastery vs. the humility the tapestry forces on him—survives the reflective mode and culminates in the micro-choice to leave both labyrinth and tapestry behind. The cost is quiet but legible: he renounces the village, the only place that will ever forgive him, to carry an unshowable wisdom forward. Felt cost and earned renunciation meet the 9- gate even though the prose occasionally over-labels his emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore—decoding the border threads literally unlocks the labyrinth, which in turn unlocks self-forgiveness. The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he refuses to stay in the village that absolves him, paying the price of perpetual exile. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One soft patch: “the motivation that had driven him here…blossomed” tells us the emotional shift we already see; a −0.3 line-level slip keeps this just under 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is not postcard scenery—it actively withholds wind, breath, motion, forcing Elian to confront memory without temporal escape. Micro-setting inside the central hall (dusty tapestry, stone pedestal) constrains every tactile move; the loom-tight border literally decides his next finger placement. The platinum labyrinth’s weight in pocket vs. hand charges the final image when he sets it down. Sensory hierarchy obeys his tutor’s eye: pattern before sound, threads before sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single stake—self-absolution—tightens when the decoded silver-gold sequence converts the labyrinth from punishment to test, foreclosing the option to keep defining himself through failure. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: each alignment click is a deliberate humiliation of old pride. Cost is visible but quiet: he accepts that the village will remain his frozen monument, never again a home. The storm’s return outside confirms the price is ongoing exposure, not a neat internal fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: strategy as character—chess, tapestry pattern, labyrinth—converges on the insight that mastery without humility is mere blindness. Subtext lives in gesture: fingers that once pushed pawns too far now push humility into platinum slots. The final image reweights the woven hush from prison to benediction without declaring it. Only flaw is a final-sentence moral overtone (“he had decoded his past and won a future”) that slightly overstates the already-earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect voice stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: chess vision turns sky into “lull between angry rolls,” village into a board of silent squares. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-clause fragments mirror the click of labyrinth pieces. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. The elevated diction (“winnow truth,” “conceptual blindness”) is justified by the tutor’s intellectual arrogance that must be humbled. Slight convergence in the closing lines toward a more generic lyrical uplift keeps this just under the 9-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivory-weighted fingers now traced invisible patterns on worn coat” does three jobs in twelve words. No scaffold loops; no metaphor pile-ups. Occasional cadence echo (“woven hush…fierce repose”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final image. One mixed metaphor slip—“tempest of regret within” beside “woven hush”—costs a hairline notch, leaving the line clean enough for high-band work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen-in-time village as absolution engine feels fresh; the tapestry-border-as-chess-scorecard is a elegant conceptual mash-up. The exiled tutor trope is familiar, but the story avoids the usual prodigy-redemption cliché by making humility the only winning move. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis instead of showdown—but the conceptual payoff lands. Slight proximity to Borges-style labyrinths keeps it from feeling wholly new.</comment>
