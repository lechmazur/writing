<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority stays abstract—"richly perceptive" is asserted, never shown through idiosyncratic noticing. His final choice to sing truth feels inevitable, but the cost is only declared ("sadness of discovery") rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse ever threatens his resolve, so the arc is smooth, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Kaelen’s song reframes the nexus, exposing false echoes—an earned conceptual repricing with felt melancholy cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each sung note thickens pattern until true echoes drown false ones; no contradictions. Orientation (who/where/when) is vague early, but the lyric mode teaches disorientation as mood, waived at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Serpentine nexus, starlight, and seashell half are sensuously re-invoked each paragraph; the shell’s murmurs constrain Kaelen’s next move, charging the final song. Canyon echo acoustics are weaponized—his voice weaponizes corridors—so setting actively shapes tactics. No spatial drift; every object stays tracked. Tone stays reed-melancholy throughout, mirroring theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore authentic echoes—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each sung verse deepens pattern, no tightening trade-off; options never narrow, only knowledge accrues. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical—sadness declared, not shown as forfeited resource. Agency is present but low-heat; song always the only plausible action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—authentic life persists as true echo—emerges through imagistic repetition of hollow vs. resonant sound. No explicit moral; final image of Kaelen becoming an echo himself reweights prior material with quiet conceptual cost. Ambiguity is preserved: webs remain, sadness lingers. Subtext operates in timbre of echoed song rather than articulated insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains reed-melancholy cadence, with controlled syntactic parallelism mimicking echoing. Diction stays within singer-poet lexicon; perceptual signature privileges sound over sight. No head-hopping; distance stable. The repetitive "reed-blown melancholy" risks template cadence but reads as ritual incantation, justified by theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates to mimic canyon delay—long sentences swell, then fragmentary echoes. Information density high; each line advances mood or mythic pattern. Occasional stacked epithets ("serpentine nexus under starlight") flirt with purple, but compression outweighs. No paraphrase loops; opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonance cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Echo-manipulation as political metaphor feels fresh; trope of singer-vs-censors is ancient, but canyon acoustics and shell-whispers give local specificity. Progressive disclosure structure mirrors content—reader experiences same peeling Kaelen undergoes. Final "he had echoed" reconfigures premise. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence justifies choice.</comment>
