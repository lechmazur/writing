<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scent-loss is felt through bodily details (“scentless gray”) and micro-choices (accepting the screw). The repairman remains a symbolic prop; his stillness is described but never tested. Her arc of renunciation earns a quiet cost, yet the healing shift is declared rather than dramatized in a final beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the screw reweighted from medical to emotional tool, visible in the final line “new way to breathe.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of water/drip images and fog beads accrue to recharge the stake. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words. Causality holds: screw → new practice → client solace shown on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fog and condensation serve as micro-setting that constrains visibility and echoes Elara’s occluded sense; water-clock drip supplies tactile rhythm she can feel. Details are filtered through her professional eye (she notices proximity, temperature, not visual tourist items). The birthing screw is a “tool-as-setting” handled twice, charging the final image. Small slip: “ticking shadows” clashes with water-clock mechanism—sound cue slightly muddled.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore healing power without scent—signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening: the gift of the screw re-weights her method and is immediately tested with the grieving client. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; stakes deepen but never threaten tangible loss, keeping pressure lyrical rather than urgent. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: drip, fog, screw motifs narrow options to non-scent therapies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “ordinary miracles” reframed from scent to silent connection. Subtext carried in gesture—screw cradled, tears easing—rather than declaration. Final image of breathing without smell offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; only soft thesis echo in “miracles” line, forgiven for brevity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“trembling calm,” “occluded views”) consistent with a sensorily-deprived healer. Rhythm mimics drip cadence; no head-hopping. Compression in early paragraphs teaches the pattern and is paid off in spare final line. Dialogue minimal and natural, though repairman voice veers slightly oracle-like.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, body, and metaphor (“morning fog clung… trembling calm”). Metaphors are coherent (water, birth, fog) and avoid clutter. No loops or repeated stems; alternating sentence lengths create breath. Final sentence cleanly propels closure; no register drift. Minor filler: “she realized” could be cut, but beat remains immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist loses smell—offers fresh inversion of healer trope. Object choice (midwife screw) is specific and non-obvious, grounding miracle theme in bodily life. Fog-drip-screw pattern feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Transformation passes: if Elara were any other healer, emotional arc would collapse. Risk is moderate; quiet lyric structure accepted at this length.</comment>
