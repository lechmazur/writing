<comment>Leo’s pyramid-scheme past is credible via the bolt talisman, but interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“he visualized his past…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The diamond payoff is foreshadowed, yet the internal stakes hinge on a single, tidy epiphany rather than a visible flaw that compounds. No secondary character pressure; Dr. Aris is a plot mouthpiece. Micro-choices exist (volunteering, lifting the bolt) but they’re linear, not contradictory under stress.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: past trauma → volunteering → bolt-as-lens → diamond is legible and lands with visible cost (the bolt is gone). Orientation is clear within 120 words; transitions are smooth; closure satisfies CR by repricing the rusted bolt into diamond. One causality wobble: glitch-text mechanics are declared, never constrained—parallel selves never risk wrong advice. Still, the single-scene arc tightens once and fulfills lens.</comment>

<comment>The fungal grotto’s glow is sensory, selective, and instrumental—its light literally powers the experiment, so the setting constrains the climax. Spatial anchoring is clean; lab shares a wall with farm, no teleporting props. The bolt functions as micro-setting/extension of body; its rust and weight charge the final image. No generic cyber-punk filler; every named detail (blue-green spectrum, shadowseam) recurs in the diamond’s facets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmute trauma into value—is signaled early and escalates via rising lab pressure; cost is legible when the bolt permanently vanishes. Agency sits with Leo: he channels rather than resists pressure, a meaningful tactical shift. Coincidence is absent; glitch messages complicate but don’t resolve. The tightening is single, not compounded, but suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: alchemy of suffering into beauty, paid for by the literal disappearance of the scar-object. No moralizing sentence spells it out; the diamond’s facets silently rebut the pyramid’s hollow gleam. Subtext operates through bolt→diamond transmutation and light imagery. Final image invites reflection without platitude; complexity is intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Leo; perceptual signature is consistent—mushroom light, rust texture, quantum uncertainty filter his diction. Syntax tightens under pressure: “a sound like a universe sighing” mirrors collapse. No head-hopping; Dr. Aris remains external. Compression is taught early and paid off; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: “soft, ethereal light…casting shifting blue and green patterns” does three jobs (sensorial, tonal, foreshadowing spectrum of diamond). Rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are crisp. Two minor loops: “pressure…pressure” in adjacent sentences mid-climax; “glitchy text messages” phrase repeats unchanged. No mixed metaphors; clarity holds at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pyramid-scheme trauma + bioluminescent fungi + quantum bolt alchemy feels inevitable in hindsight, not templated. The transmutation rule is established early and followed through. Specific detail—rusted submarine bolt vs. hollow pyramid—creates memorable friction. Risky conceptual premise commits fully without exposition dump; closure image is non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
