<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “warmly observant” trait is shown through her tactile attention to crabs and strata; her motive—discover the texture of time—drives every micro-choice. Internal contradiction is light but present: she studies periphery to avoid direct confrontation yet knows avoidance itself is part of transition. The final stance—transform, not abandon—costs her the safety of Kael’s stasis, and the cicada return seals it. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; both speakers keep distinct cadence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cicada reweights “leaving” into “shedding,” with felt cost in Kael’s slow nod. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tidal imagery accumulates until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean: who/when/where anchored within first 60 words. No lens ambiguity; tidal pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Grotto, cicada, and starlight are used as micro-setting: cicada’s cool surface against skin constrains Elara’s tactile focus; tidal pools carve literal channels that mirror time’s texture. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through her chronicler bias. Environment does not merely echo mood—it supplies the metaphor that reframes the conflict. No anachronisms; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as they circle the pools.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to exit the coast without fracturing the bond—is signaled in the first paragraph. Escalation is textural: each pool, shell-change, and star-shift tightens the inevitability of departure. Single decisive turn when Elara lifts the cicada and renames “letting go” as “transform,” foreclosing Kael’s hope of stasis. Cost is legible in his soft-footed echo and the relinquishing of the artifact back to pouch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tidal recurrence and molting imagery rather than thesis statements; the final image of “tide to be ridden” reweights earlier fear into acceptance. Subtext lives in gesture: Kael’s weight-shift, the silent handing of metaphor. No moralizing; ambiguity remains—will transformation heal or merely change them? Resonance is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is strong: chronicler’s diction favors strata, channels, gritty sand, fluid tide. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative sentences pool like water, then shorten at the turn (“Like this, we are in a transition period”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: Kael’s “What do you see?” and Elara’s oblique answer advance the reconfiguration. No register drift; diction stays within her observant lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no template cadence; figurative language is spare and tide-specific. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory detail, emotional state, and metaphor (“texture of time here—it was gritty like sand, yet fluid like the incoming tide”). No mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she saw”) but they serve chronicler stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—using tidal pool minutiae to unlock a relationship stalemate—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk is quiet: no plot pyrotechnics, yet stakes feel large because the metaphor is lived, not stated. Cicada as transformation key could verge on trope, but its handled coolness and return to pouch particularize it. Final reconfiguration grows from prior particulars; swap cicada for any trinket and the charge would drop, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
