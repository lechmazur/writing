<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and aesthetic mission are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“magnificent simplicity”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction; the final stance is earned yet the absence of live opposition keeps pressure academic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-capture beat thickens the silence until the bonfire reconfigures it into resonant Charged Poise; orientation is swift, cost is felt in the bowl’s pulse, no causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass dome, half-drowned trees, and shipwreck wood are tactile and bias-filtered; the bowl’s warming surface anchors the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining her release decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem silence into story—tightens when heat forces echoes out; escalation is textural, not perilous, but the single deepening is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bowl’s transformation from begging to preservation; no moral is stated, yet the reweighting of “unfinished” lands with conceptual cost—beauty now requires permanent absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium; rhythmic repetition (“unbinded echo”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final cadence; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs and varied sentence length carry momentum; minor loop (“the chronic hush remained…”) and occasional stacked modifiers (“sunken orchard greenhouse, its glass dome…”) keep it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-cataclysm silence harvested by violin-echoes feels fresh; the bonfire-as-recorder twist grows inevitably from setup, avoiding eco-cliché through sensory specificity.</comment>
