<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts into therapy-speak (“she practiced a fold in patience”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The parasol tip works as tactile tether, yet the planned-death pivot is declared, not embodied in scene, so the cost feels pre-cooked. Still, the stance crystallization at the end is legible and earned by accretion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parasol-tip image reweights the suicide premise into continuity, with windborne solace as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each trawl thickens texture rather than causal chain—yet the “waking changed” inciting beat is off-stage, a soft ellipsis that blunts the decisive change. Within lyric mode, the tightening is sufficient and resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is sensuously specific: groaning wood, slurry net, gull cries all filter through Elara’s loosened grip on reality. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors arrive early; no orientation penalty applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stay alive after planned death—remains abstract until the final parasol beat; prior trawls accumulate texture, not narrower options. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lace sound becomes the sound of endings, reweighting stakes under accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: lace, ice, and wind converge on the idea that endings are continuities. No moralizing; the final rustle is image-only. Subtext about volunteerism as self-rescue is faint but present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is consistent, rhythmic, and slightly numinous—“she gripped reality loosely” is repeated like a mantra that teaches the pattern. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled. Syntax mirrors the fold-patience cadence without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety supports the breath of waiting. Occasional filter stacks (“she realized,” “she wondered”) dilute immediacy but never cluster in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or loops; information density is high and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Euthanasia-tourist-turned-volunteer is fresh; lace parasol tip as life-thread is specific, not quirky. The drift-ice trawl transforms familiar disaster trope into meditative pattern. Risk is quiet but coherent; no derivative echo.</comment>
