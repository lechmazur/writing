<comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically sustained (“troubling serenity,” “beauty approximated infinity”) yet remains abstract-label rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly costs her until the final sonic encoding, so the climactic renunciation feels serene rather than painfully earned. The brass gear functions as inherited talisman, but its generational weight is asserted, not dramatized through conflicting impulses. Voice stays consistent, but emotional stakes stay at a meditative remove; we witness a mood, not a crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sonic broadcast re-weights infinity from visual to acoustic legacy, cost felt in the garden’s fading light. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonar ping layers density until pattern-break (the fissure) forces stance shift to dissemination. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causal gaps. The “approximating infinity” refrain risks distant philosophizing, but final image pays it off by converting calculation into echo, not number.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: crystallized petals, brass gear teeth, and sonar echoes become the tactile world. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory, mirroring Elara’s non-visual ethic. Spatial choreography is dreamlike yet trackable: ark insertion, ping azimuths, falling light. Environment constrains the only possible solution—sound transmission—so setting actively shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve beauty without combustion—locks in early. Escalation is textural: each ping thickens the pattern until the anomaly deepens the stakes from maintenance to legacy. Protagonist agency is present but interior; she engineers the sonic code, paying with the garden’s dissolution. Cost is legible yet cerebral; a sharper visceral loss would tighten the screw further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: transmission over possession, memory over matter. Subtext resides in the gear’s worn brass and the dying petals—calculation versus ephemerality. No moralizing; the final “perpetual whisper” re-prices infinity as echo, not flame. Ambiguity is productive: future listeners may reconstruct or mis-hear, proving theme that light shared is never fixed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: cosmically-scaled yet tenderly precise diction (“nascent nebulae,” “ancestral design”). Rhythm pulses with anapestic lift that mimics sonar cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries alone; it modulates from wonder to elegy without register drift. Filter verbs are sparing and justified by meditative distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor strings serve the cosmic lyric mode without cluttering causality. No loops or paraphrase. Sentence variety is good, though occasional stacked adjectives (“soft glow of nascent nebulae”) flirt with density. Peak beat—“the quiet sigh of falling petals”—is crystalline, earning its poetic license.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sonar-as-memory, garden-as-circuit, infinity-as-echo. Tropes of dying utopias and cosmic gardeners are subverted by acoustic rather than fiery preservation. Risky lyric accumulation is taught early and paid off in closure. Specificity of brass gear teeth and petal-sighs prevents abstraction from evaporating stakes.</comment>
