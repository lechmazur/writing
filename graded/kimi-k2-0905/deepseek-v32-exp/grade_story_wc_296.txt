<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s guarded-druid trait is shown through her measured ritual actions rather than told, and her interiority stays concrete (“her emotions locked away like seeds in winter”). The micro-choice to press the carnivorous seed against the ice crystallizes her values and carries visible cost (the seed’s death, the vortex’s calm). The confession’s release does create a credible internal shift, but the prose flirts with diagnostic shorthand (“her own guardedness unbend”) that keeps this just shy of 9-band emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the whispered name “Morwen” decisively reweights the curse and Elara’s stance. Causal chain holds: failed illusion → frozen confession → seed ritual → truth released → vortex stilled. Orientation is clean within 60 words. One minor elasticity slip: the seed’s “hunger” is introduced as world-rule only at the moment it is used; still, the rule is paid off in the same beat, so the lens stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The swirling orchard-vortex is never a postcard; its churning petals and ozone tang constrain movement and supply the ritual energy Elara harvests. Micro-setting objects—the ice shard, the flesh-eating seed—are handled tactilely and charge the final image (seed crumbles to dust as price). Spatial choreography is clean: concentric circles widen logically from eye to roots. A hairline slip into emblematic symbolism (“echoes of past failures”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking generational silence—surfaces in paragraph three and tightens when the seed’s absorption of rigidity forecloses the option to stay guarded. Agency sits with Elara: her chant and pressure decision drive the reversal. Cost is visible on-page: seed’s death, vortex’s halt, her own emotional unbending. No coincidence; escalation is one smooth curve rather than a spike, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—truth hidden beneath reflective surfaces—emerges through the ice that “reflecting nothing, not even her face” rather than exposition. The confession’s release reweights the orchard from cursed to regenerative without moralizing. A faint echo of prompt-language (“what mirrors don’t show”) is filtered through Elara’s perception, minimizing intrusion. Resonance is present but not yet indelible; the closing vow feels a half-step toward tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close druid voice sustains arboreal diction (“brittle, flesh-eating plant seeds,” “gnarled roots that twisted into agonized shapes”). Rhythm tightens under ritual pressure—short percussive clauses echo drumbeat chant. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly Elara-bound. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“She sensed…”). One register lift (“crystalline shard”) is marginal and keeps this within high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies, propulsive without algorithmic drumbeat. Information density high: each sentence advances ritual, setting, or ice mechanics. Mixed-metaphor risk (“froth of petals and decay”) is justified by vortex physics. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or scaffold. One tiny hedge—“she began to chant, her voice a steady drum”—could trim “began to,” but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: flesh-eating seed as truth-therapy tool flips horror trope into healing device. Expanding-circle search pattern externalizes emotional unbending without self-help jargon. Specificity of “orchard vortex” and ozone-rot scent grounds fantasy in lived odor. Concept commits fully—no retreat to generic druid cliché. Risk feels organic, not gimmick-driven; the inversion of predator-into-midwife is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
