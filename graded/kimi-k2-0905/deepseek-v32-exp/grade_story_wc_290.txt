<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are repeatedly named rather than dramatized; the only embodied panic is a single line “her claustrophobia threatened to overwhelm.” The decisive moment—drafting the harmonic blueprint—arrives via convenient organ exposition, not a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority drifts into generic lyric uplift (“she felt eternally transformed”) that abstracts rather than embodies change. The keeper’s sudden appearance erases solitary-pressure stakes, flattening the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the spatial chaos stills, her fear recedes, starlight brightens—cost is the endurance of terror now legibly paid. Causality, however, is soft: the compass correlates “points with resonant frequencies” off-page; the keeper supplies the key instead of Elara discovering it. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear within 50 words, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the organ’s cadence layers density until the pattern break brings stasis—legible but not tactically driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The nexus is evoked with kinetic, sense-driven specifics: “walls shifted and floors curved rebelliously,” “starlight pierced the darkness,” drafts tasted of “cold iron.” The compass is handled twice, its pivoting leg charging the final blueprint beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent as passages narrow; the keeper’s organ loft is economically placed. Weather and occupational detail are absent, but the micro-setting (body + tool) constrains choice sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the key while surviving spatial mutiny—is signaled early and tightened once: passages constrict, claustrophobia spikes. Yet escalation is ambient (environment keeps warping) rather than propelled by her tactics; the organ calms space ex machina before her blueprint action. No visible resource is lost or forfeited; the cost is emotional abstraction (“terror eased”). Agency is present—she drafts—but the keeper’s dialogue resolves conflict more than her own maneuvering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of mastering inner space via outer harmony emerges implicitly through the organ–compass synthesis, avoiding overt moral. The final image reweights “spatial mutiny” from threat to “dance of possibilities,” accomplishing Conceptual Repricing. However, the insight is articulated by the narrator in the reflective coda rather than left to resonate solely through image. Some lyric phrases skirt sentiment (“timeless melody of change”) but overall subtext holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, filtering perception through Elara’s selective attention (“starlight tasted cold”). Sentence rhythm modulates—compressed fragments under pressure, longer cadences during organ crescendo—without algorithmic pattern. No dialogue to test naturalism; no head-hopping. Diction stays within explorer-poet register; occasional elevated phrasing (“spatial mutiny,” “wistful rebellion”) is purposeful motif-creation, not register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences pull double duty (“the blueprint drafting compass point, an ancient tool she believed could map the nexus’s unstable geometry” delivers prop, motive, and world rule). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Two mixed metaphors (“starlight tasted of cold iron”; “music transfixed the air”) are vivid enough to pass. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookmarks. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she recalled… she reflected”) in coda dulls momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “claustrophobic explorer mapping unstable space with sound” is a fresh synthesis; the compass-as-notation-device repurposes a familiar tool into harmonic transcription. Spatial-mutiny setting and lonely-organ controller risk videogame echo, but emotional stakes keep it human. Final reframe of mutiny as “dance of possibilities” offers non-obvious after-image. Does not push formal risk beyond lyric accumulation, so stops short of top band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade>
</comment>Setup, middle, closure all orbit her claustrophobia; it constrains forward motion and is eased by the harmonic victory—cost is the endured panic. Yet panic is summarized, never shown blocking a specific maneuver, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade>
</comment>Compass first appears early, maps frequencies mid-action, and drafts the final key—three beats with irreplaceable function. Its pivoting leg literalizes the spatial “turn,” charging the closure image. Swapping to any other tool breaks the harmonic transcription logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade>
</comment>Spatial mutiny is the ever-tightening threat that narrows passages and forces her to use the compass; it is stilled only at the coda, reweighted as可控 “dance.” Without it, no pressure and no need for a sonic key.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade>
</comment>“Prudently adventurous” is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized via a risky choice that backfires; she proceeds cautiously throughout. Trait labels rather than visible trade-off, so integration stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade>
</comment>“Transfix” occurs once when the organ first sounds; it halts her panic and resets the spatial tempo, enabling drafting. A stronger second return at climax would have lifted the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade>
</comment>The lonely organ is signaled early (“reverberation echoed”), its mechanics explained (harmonics tame space), and it directly enables the final blueprint. Removing the organ collapses both the world rule and the harmonic key discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade>
</comment>The shadowed nexus supplies the ever-shifting walls that threaten suffocation and force compass use; starlight delivers the visual anchor for the final node. Setting is more postcard than socio-physical system, but it does constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade>
</comment>“Fallow period” ensures solitude and quiet for organ audibility, mentioned early and late. However, it functions as static backdrop rather than a ticking clock that alters available moves—time is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade>
</comment>Desire for the lost harmonic key is stated in opening paragraph and propels entry; it collides with her fear when passages narrow. Want versus fear tension is present but resolved externally by keeper explanation rather than her own epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade>
</comment>“Wistful rebellion” is repeatedly named and modulates from yearning to quiet triumph, coloring final smile. Tone is coherent but verbally announced; the rebellion never manifests as an unexpected, rule-breaking act—more internal mood than plotted stance.</comment>
