<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—breath misting, key warming, heartbeat syncing with ice—but “logically emotional” never crystallizes into a visible contradiction that costs him on the page; the trait merely labels. His final choice to merge with the key’s frequency is smooth, yet feels inevitable rather than wrested from clashing impulses. No moment forces him to betray logic for emotion or vice-versa, so the arc is competent but not scalding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain: thinning ice → vibrational mismatch → hum-to-sync → lighthouse activation → restored stasis. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen stands guard, path foreclosed, cost felt in the key’s lingering warmth against his chest. One minor scaffold: “the key grew warmer, its resonance seeking harmony” restates the prior beat; doesn’t break causality but keeps this just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is more than postcard: creaking dock, shattered-glass ice shards, runed lighthouse door all press back on Kaelen’s feet, breath, ears. Micro-setting (key against sternum) literally channels the absolution wave, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—sound and touch dominate, color last—so detail never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artifact must not shatter—signalled on entry; pressure tightens as ice groans skew the key’s frequency. One visible price: key almost fractures, Kaelen’s breath cracks, stance recalibrates; options narrow to “become the frequency.” Agency is continuous; no outside savior. Escalation is linear, not quantum, so high-band but not apex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-synthesis emerges via sound imagery rather than thesis lines; no moralizing paragraph. “Fleshly ethereal” texture recurs but mostly as mood varnish, not choice reconfigurer. Final stillness carries quiet resonance yet doesn’t reprice the premise—no new rule, only restored balance—so depth is sturdy, not vertiginous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kaelen’s perceptual field: breath-scale cold, groan-pitch calculus, coat whispering like distant waves. Syntax mirrors process—long consonant-rich clauses for analysis, then clipped fragments under strain. No head-hop or register drift; occasional poetic uplift (“shattered glass,” “fleshly ethereal”) fits the lyric concept without purple spill.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences for sunset sweep, staccato for crunch-steps. Information density strong: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, tool state, and emotional valence. Minor loop: “the key grew warmer, its resonance seeking harmony” duplicates prior sense; one mixed metaphor “sunset bled gold into violet” is passably picturesque but not muddled. Closure beat is clean, earns its hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vibrational tuning as conflict-resolution is fresh; lighthouse-as-sound-purifier flips the usual beacon trope. Marina/ice combo supplies novelty, yet Kaelen’s lone guardian archetype is standard. Specific sensory stitching (key warmth synced to breath) keeps the concept from reading as prompt mash-up. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—mid-high originality.</comment>
