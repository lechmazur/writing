<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s need to “discover hidden truths” is dramatized through the concrete act of opening forbidden files; the rosewood nib anchors lineage and complicity. Interiority stays specific (“cold fury,” “absurd, to use logic to uncover a heart’s betrayal”) without label-speak. The final keystroke fuses heirloom and tablet, dramatizing renunciation with visible cost—she forecloses her inherited silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: “journalist’s call → proof-by-contraction plan → drawer opened → contradiction found → public confession typed.” Each step forces the next, tightening options. Closure lands as Decisive Change: she trades silence for testimony, stylus-tap audible in the echoing dome, cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s height and sealed archive physically gate her search; clouds below mirror the “uncaring stars,” objectifying moral distance. Rosewood nib reappears, charged; its final mating with the stylus fuses eras and makes the dome acoustically witness her rupture with family orbit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single stake: break family orbit of lies or stay complicit. Escalation is one deepening: each file thickens guilt, tightening her options until only disclosure remains. Cost visible—the nib’s inherited weight becomes the tool that will publish their fall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orbits of regret motif emerges through repetitions of cyclical silence; the telescope’s gaze literalizes detached observation turned inward. Final confession converts private vigil into public accountability, reweighting “orbit” from trap to trajectory. No explicit moralizing; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“ink-smudged proofs,” “newsprint-smelling crypt”—diction precise, never ventriloquizing authority she lacks. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses during file reveals; longer cadences return for dome ascent, mirroring resolve. No dialogue, hence no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths maintain momentum; high density (“vaulted dome… swallowed her solitude whole”). One metaphor string forgiven because pattern taught early (“orbits of regret”). Closing line avoids scaffold, ends on resonant tap. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: journalism ethics + inherited astronomical observatory + formal proof logic yields a quiet, interior thriller. Proof-by-contradiction as narrative engine is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky tonal blend—“solemn playfulness”—carries through to final stylus-fusion image without gimmickry.</comment>
