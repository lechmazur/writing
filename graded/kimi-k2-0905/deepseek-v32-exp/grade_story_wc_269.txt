<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is specific—tapping as embodied coping, coral-bleach memory as ghost—and the final “mooring” is earned by the data epiphany. Yet the emotional arc is relayed more through summary than dramatized micro-choice; we’re told the weight lifts rather than watching a visible forfeiture. Still, the contradiction between ecological grief and stubborn vigilance stays credible, powering the stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the atlas page flips from relic of loss to benchmark of renewal, reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost (years of doubt). Causal lens holds—data correlation triggers the change of heart. One minor drag: the “periodically eternal cycles” phrase is repeated without tightening, blunting the final cadence. Otherwise structure is taut, single-scene, with orientation anchored within 120 words.</comment>

<comment>Salt air, blinking console, skeletal coral—vivid, selective, filtered through a marine biologist’s eye. The station itself functions as micro-setting: metal desk under tapping fingers, screen glass under salt haze, constraining the only possible action—data assembly. Atlas page as handled prop evolves from grief token to recovery gauge, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightened when data re-links vanished routes to historic pollution peaks, revealing re-emergence. Escalation is conceptual rather than adversarial: tension moves from haunted uncertainty to grounded hope via one causal insight; cost is the accumulated years of sorrow the reader is asked to feel retroactively. Sufficient for this length, though secondary physical stakes (funding, career, solitude) stay off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—renewal delayed but not extinguished—emerges through the atlas page’s re-pricing rather than authorial statement. Subtext lives in the drift-tap rhythm echoing tidal pulse, linking personal nerves to planetary heartbeat. Final smile is understated, avoiding moralizing. The piece flirts with “periodically eternal” as refrain; one instance drifts toward thesis-like utterance, trimming resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Kaelen’s perceptions; no head-hop. Tapping motif creates a rhythmic signature that modulates with emotional intensity—slow today because the sea is calm. Lexicon remains within a scientist’s plausible range; no filter-verb clutter. One tiny lapse: “periodically eternal cycles” sounds authorial rather than idiosyncratic to Kaelen’s inner voice, but the pattern is taught early and persists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, with high information density; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative language is spare and accurate—no mixed metaphors. Occasional template cadence (“periodically eternal” repeated) is the only scaffold trace, and it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-ban sea-steward solitude, coral-memory as haunting, data-as-redemption—fresh synthesis of climate-fiction tropes. Atlas-page prop repurposed from nostalgia object to scientific baseline feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate: slow-data epiphany instead of disaster pivot, but it pays off through rhythmic tapping linkage. Could edge higher with a bolder structural risk or sharper occupational specificity.</comment>
