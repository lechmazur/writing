<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Kaelen’s curiosity and functional creativity are shown through tactile mapping and jury-rigging, but interior contradiction is thin; his stoic register stays flat across beats, muting the cost of failure. The sextant choice to leave it behind is a credible renunciation, yet the emotional price feels declared (“quiet satisfaction”) rather than embodied. Still, micro-choices (tracing railing, aligning reflectors) track a consistent engineer’s gaze, keeping the arc coherent if not viscerally charged.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of sextant → remap utilities → reroute light/water → garden glow. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words and the final image reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—the terminal becomes sanctuary, not transport hub. Escalation is gradual rather than knife-twist, but the tightening is legible: each repurposed conduit forecloses restoration and commits Kaelen to a non-commercial future. Closure earns its resonance, though the cost is more conceptual than physically dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Dust motes in cracked domes, dry aqueducts mimicking constellations, and the brass sextant’s heft deliver sensory specificity filtered through an engineer’s eye. Spatial choreography stays clean as Kaelen moves from atrium to kiosk to utility tunnels; distances and tool use track. The setting actively shapes tactics—solar geometry, pipe routes, dormant seeds—charging the final illuminated garden. Scale is kept economical; no tourism-catalog clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“resurrect heart without restoring original glory”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each repurposed conduit locks Kaelen farther from conventional rehab; the hydroponic sprout is the visible price/test. No external antagonist, but systemic decay and limited materials supply coherent friction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping escalation steady but not crushing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “hope as dynamic redirected flow” emerges through conduits, light, and seeds rather than exposition. Subtext lives in silent sextant left glowing on pedestal—navigation symbol repurposed from commerce to sanctuary. No moralizing final line; the whisper of possibilities is earned by concrete garden image. Ambiguity remains: terminal still derelict, yet alive—complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent engineer’s perceptual signature—angles, materials, flow rates. Syntax stays lean, modulating into shorter fragments under tactile tasks. No head-hopping; diction remains within plausible intern lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating during pipe rerouting, slowing for reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; high information density—each sentence advances setting or motive. Minor scaffold: “redirected flows” concept is stated repeatedly without new angle; “maze of intentions” echoed four times, thinning impact. No contradictory metaphors or register drift. Clean grammar, precise spatial tracking, zero paraphrase loops in closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Abandoned spaceport reborn as hydroponic sanctuary” offers fresh synthesis of ruins-garden trope. Sextant-as-urban-seed is a pleasing repurposing of celestial tool to terrestrial hope. Conceptual reweighting feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Could push further into aerospace-specific decay details for higher originality.</comment>
