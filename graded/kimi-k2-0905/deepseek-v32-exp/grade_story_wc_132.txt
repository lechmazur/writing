<comment>Elara’s shift from control-freak scientist to storm-soaked listener is credibly embodied: the uncurled fingers letting the leaf fly, the hand on wet bark in solidarity. Interiority stays concrete, not diagnostic—“she felt a part of the garden rather than its master” shows the cost of surrender without naming it. The only drag is a touch of repetitive “metamorphosis” language that slightly blurs the contradiction inside her; still, the final silence-as-acceptance is earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure hinges on a Conceptual Repricing: releasing the leaf re-weights her entire scientific paradigm. Causal lens holds throughout—each storm beat because/therefore strips away a prop or belief until the final image of her soaked beside the tree. Cost is visible: she forfeits her identity as controller and accepts an open-ended “community of survivors.” One micro loop of “reconstruction” rhetoric near the end is too minor to nick the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: its shift from rigid structure to absorptive support mirrors and constrains her choice to bend rather than brace. Rain-soaked sensory detail is filtered through nursery-owner priorities—pH, light, petrichor—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; the leaf’s spiral away provides a crisp final camera move that recharges the trellis image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs. adaptive surrender—tightens with each storm: props fail, trellis softens, leaf is released. One meaningful turn at the leaf release narrows her options from fix to witness; cost is the loss of her former self-concept. Agency is interior but visible; no coincidence rescues her. The escalation is lyrical rather than plot-twist, satisfying the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience through surrender, not dominance. No moralizing—final image of her soaked beside the tree is a quiet Conceptual Repricing that invites multiple readings. The linden leaf’s journey from specimen to wind-borne token re-weights “study” into humility. Ambiguity lingers: will the nursery thrive under this new ethic?—exactly the right unsettled resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s plant-scientist perceptual signature: veins as “map,” moss as “emerald carpet.” Syntax breathes with storm rhythm—long sentences for downpour, fragments for leaf release. No dialogue, so voice compression under pressure appears in the clipped “She would learn.” Filter verbs are minimal and earned; diction stays within nursery-owner lexicon. One templated “reconstruction” phrase keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances stance or atmosphere; no scaffold. Metaphors are consistent—storm, moss, leaf—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm accelerates into the release beat, then softens into acceptance. One paraphrase loop of “transformation” stems costs −0.2, but it never touches the closure image. Clean copy, vivid nouns/verbs, no hedges.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “botanist unlearns control via storm” angle is fresh; the mossy trellis as emblem of flexible support is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of storm-as-revelation and leaf-as-lesson are transformed through her vocational lens. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-dramatic release—no tree snaps, no triumph—yet coherence holds. Could not swap names/places without breaking the nursery expertise that grounds the insight.</comment>
