<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—“expectantly resigned,” “unlearning hatred”—yet never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse or micro-choice that costs her anything. The rosette discovery is passive (she simply opens a chest) and her final instruction to the choir is paraphrased, so the visible cost is off-loaded onto students rather than embodied by her. No genuine flaw or status tension is dramatized on the page, so the “harmony” feels willed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece lands a quiet Charged Poise: the choir’s braided chord reweights the stake of cultural loss, and the rosette’s image lingers with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of subtractive metaphor rather than because/therefore—taught early and held to the final cadence. Orientation is clear by line 20; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt, but the protagonist’s agency is indirect—she finds, then explains—so the decisive change is communal, not personal, slightly blunting immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Velvet library, autumn leaves, honeyed rosette wood—sensory triad is selective, tactile, and returned in the final image to charge closure. The “vanishing arts” motif is anchored in concrete objects (songbooks, fragile instruments) that constrain Elara’s urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Micro-setting (rosette as locus of balance) directly shapes the pedagogical tactic, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing vanishing arts through choral harmony—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only texturally: repeated “subtracting noise” metaphor and autumn’s fade intensify mood rather than narrow options. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized for Elara; the risk remains abstract. The final chord is lovely but does not foreclose any live alternative, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from the rosette’s braided pattern and the choir’s fused chord; no moralizing coda. Subtextual work is done by silence—students’ hesitant breaths, the library’s hush—so the idea that quiet can be cultivated resists platitude. The vanishing-arts motif is particular rather than nostalgic, but the “unlearning hatred” backstory is asserted, not dramatized, limiting complexity. Final image reweights earlier motifs without sermon, earning moderate resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyric voice sustains a consistent ecclesiastical cadence; diction stays within a music-teacher’s poetic register. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged on narrative texture alone—velvet, lullaby, honeyed glow—each recurrence tightens the tonal braid. Filter verbs are sparse; perception is embodied. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences in library hush, shorter clauses at rosette revelation, mirroring intake of breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, read-aloud musical, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is taught early (“subtracting noise”) and paid off in final chord, so density feels intentional rather than purple. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor paraphrase echo: “travelled stillness” and “quiet earned” are near-restatements, but separation allows pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>6.8</question><comment>Premise fuses choral pedagogy with craft-preservation metaphor—fresh angle on familiar harmony-against-hate template. Rosette-as-pedagogical-tool is specific and non-generic; removal would collapse the method. Risk is quiet rather than bold, keeping score mid-high. The “unlearning hatred” frame risks thematic echo of prompt, but local detail (Persian rug, leaded glass) individuates the world.</comment>
