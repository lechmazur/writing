<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory lineage (arsonist’s child who fights fire) is embodied in every tactile choice—kneeling in black sand, mixing volcanic paste, surrendering the coin—so the internal split stays live. The graft beat forces her to risk her own peace to give the girl voice; the coin transfer crystallizes cost. One slip: “haunted her steps” drifts toward label-speak; a sharper sensory cue would lock 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coin passes, the girl sings, options reconfigure—redemption is felt, not declared. Causal chain holds: because Elara grafts, therefore the scar sings; because she relinquishes the coin, therefore her own loss gains meaning. Lens stays situational-accumulative: pressure crystallizes rather than reverses. Minor waver: “Today, we help your scars find their voice” front-loads theme; trimming would let action speak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black sand, obsidian lagoon, and kelp-drift calm are not backdrop—they supply the mineral paste that enables the graft and mirror the singing scar. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, mix, smooth, press; coin passes hand-to-hand. One micro-gap: cloud migration is lovely but never tightens the clock. Still, environment constrains the medical act and charges the final image, satisfying 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once: the graft must work or the mantra fails. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the girl’s stillness and Elara’s need to atone. Cost is visible: the coin—last link to the traveler she lost—leaves Elara’s pocket forever. A second beat of complication (infection fear, paste failure) could push 8.8+ but would risk word-count breach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coin’s migration and the sand’s transformation into voice: destruction re-seeded as art. Final image—girl’s quiet song—reweights every prior burn without moralizing. Subtext of inherited guilt remains complex; no redemption is guaranteed, only offered. Avoids thematic echo by letting gesture carry the statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder, filtering every detail through firefighter precision and daughter-guilt: “gracefully alert poise” is both posture and defense. Syntax lengthens during the graft, shortens at the coin pass, mirroring breath. No head-hop; girl’s interior accessed only through flinch and smile. One clause drifts toward editorial: “a testament to the earth’s own healing”; recasting in Elara’s idiom would lock 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses: sibilant sand, dental stops in “drilled and strung,” open vowels of the song. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Metaphor count stays just under the density ceiling; one more stacked image in the graft paragraph would have triggered −0.3. Line-level control supports closure without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Firefighter-arsonist’s-daughter is fresh; pairing that with folk-medical graft on a volcanic beach feels inevitable yet unseen. Coin-on-red-thread as voice-token reverses the usual lucky-charm trope: luck is surrendered, not kept. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than conflagration payoff; risk lands. Could edge 9+ with a sharper micro-failure beat mid-graft.</comment>
