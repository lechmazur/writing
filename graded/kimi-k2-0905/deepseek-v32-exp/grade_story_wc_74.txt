<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia and painter identity are concretely anchored, but her interiority drifts into generic “methodically hopeful” abstractions rather than embodied contradiction. The remembered scenes are felt through her body, yet she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything; the visions happen to her. Because no option is foreclosed on the page, the arc remains observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visionary beat thickens the tapestry of kindness under a brightening moon. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elara sees the city as softer because strangers remember—but the cost is atmospheric, not personal; she loses nothing and therefore pays no price. The final image reweights the premise, yet the stakes never tighten to a point where her own path is altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-micro-setting is tactile—humid air, wooden table, moonlight on glass—and the smog outside functions as moral counter-pressure. The moon-tipped brush is handled in multiple beats and its shimmer directly enables the visions, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the city’s geography remains vague, but that vagueness serves the dream-logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is cognitive—prove kindness endures—but it escalates only by accumulation of examples, not by narrowing Elara’s options or risking a loss. No reversal or trade-off appears; the visions simply confirm her thesis. Because the protagonist’s stance never crystallizes under pressure, the tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kindness-as-universal-language emerges organically from the parade of specific, perishable tongues. The final image of a “global network of remembered kindnesses” reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Theme is slightly thinned by repetition—each vignette makes the same point—yet the accumulation achieves resonance rather than sloganeering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction poetically compressed (“saffron quiet,” “waxing moon’s glow”) yet remains legible. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under visionary intensity. The cadence of long, luminous sentences mirrors insomnia’s hyper-clear night sight, but occasional template stems (“She saw… She painted…”) dull the rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus thematic weight—with strong noun-verb propulsion. Figurative layering is dense, yet patterned early (“moon-tipped brush,” “saffron quiet”) so it reads as taught motif rather than purple overwrite. Minor paraphrase loops inside contiguous beats (“visions… daydreams… memories”) and one filter-verb cluster near the climax prevent a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of insomnia, rooftop greenhouse, and moon-channeled lost-language memories is non-obvious and freshly synthesized. Each vignette pivots on a tiny, extinct kindness that would collapse if transposed to generic settings. The concept risks sentimentality yet escapes through linguistic specificity and the final conceptual reprice that makes kindness itself the surviving “language.”</comment>
