<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s “turn pain into cosmic joke” motive is vivid early and steers every beat; his micro-choice to laugh at confessions rather than console is crystalline. Interiority slips into diagnostic gloss (“frostbitten hope”) once, muting embodied contradiction. The arrowhead’s warming in pocket offers tactile cost, earning the shift from despair to levity without tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s gravity-dance and thawing hope reconfigure stakes with felt cost—Aris pockets a now-alive relic, foreclosing undercover objectivity. Causal chain (arrowhead → gravity shift → metamorphose) holds; one minor ellipsis—how confessions travel through cracked phone—is accepted under lyric license. Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Underground garden is no backdrop: levitating herbs and anchor-stones actively constrain how Aris plants the arrowhead and how bodies reshape. Gravity trait is taught early, paid off in climactic weightless dance. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and kinesthetic drift, mirroring emotional buoyancy. Micro-setting (arrowhead as portable lodestone) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will absurdity dissolve grief?”—tightens when Aris chooses laughter in real time, narrowing options from healer to trickster-guide. One meaningful escalation: static confession → joke → gravitational bloom → bodily light-shift; each step carries visible price (soil stain, phone silence). No off-stage rescue; metamorphose is irreversible. Cost legible, though could be sharper (e.g., personal identity bleed).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: sorrow transmuted into laughter becomes a living ecology. Subtext lives in gesture—plants lean toward spinning arrowhead rather than exposition. Final image of “garden waving goodbye” offers conceptual repricing: grief is not solved but choreographed. avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in gravity’s chuckle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains perceptual signature of covert observer: clinical note-taking (“cryptid researcher”) collides with lyrical punchlines. Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments mimic static crackle. No head-hop; Elara’s shift from frost to warmth is seen from outside, preserving POV modesty. Diction stays within Aris’s idiom until one near-philosophical “cosmic joke,” forgivable as mantra.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences float during levitation, staccato during confessions. Information density high—one line can layer scent, stake, and tool state. Only minor scaffold: “the metamorphose began” slightly outlines what image already shows. No mixed metaphors or template cadence; final line earns its resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cryptid noir with lyric gravity-fantasy feels fresh; “cosmic joke” as therapeutic praxis is non-obvious. Arrowhead-as-tuning-fork for grief-gravity could veer gimmicky but stays rooted in sensory consequence. Familiar “returned changed” trope is reweighted through botanical slapstick rather than horror. Risk doesn’t outrun clarity.</comment>
