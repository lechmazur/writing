<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority (“to discover the texture of borrowed time”) is vivid and embodied, but the vortex inheritance and oak cap arrive as inherited labels; we see no prior flaw or contradiction that this moment tests, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Still, her tactile seed choreography and the silk/stone image show a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portal snaps open with the acorn cap glowing, crystallizing options and felt cost (“a path where past and future intertwined”). Causal chain holds: egg tremor → cap placement → entropy drop → portal. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound atrium is more than backdrop—frost thickens glass, starlight refracts onto seeds, spatially constraining how Elara kneels and sows. The micro-setting of her gloved palms cradling the egg functions as tactile “room” that charges the final image when the cap leaves her hand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prevent vortex collapse and reopen gateway”—tightens once when the shell cracks; cap placement forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: the cap’s glow consumes the last seed energy, visible in the beam that strikes the wall. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “preserved time as living seed” emerges from seed-orbit imagery and the silk/stone texture; no moralizing sentence intrudes. Final portal image reweights prior seed patterns as “borrowed seconds” reclaimed—resonant without tidy thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—Elara notices frost veins, seed constellations, vortex hum—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm accelerates into staccato sowing beats under starlight, then lengthens as portal ripples, mirroring pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “pale and veined with shifting colors” packs visual and tactile data; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors (ice-crack, celestial orbits) stay coherent; final silk/stone image is precise, not purple. Minor repetition of “furiously tranquil” is earned by pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vortex-as-inheritance is familiar SF trope, but seed-saver mythicising and the oak acorn cap as entropy lens feel freshly synthesized. Risk taken: no antagonist, pure ritual—yet coherence holds. Transformation test passes; swap seeds for gears and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
