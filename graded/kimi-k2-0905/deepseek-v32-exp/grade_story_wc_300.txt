<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaelen is vividly interior and his emotional arc—from detached inspector to conduit of abandoned hopes—tracks clearly, with embodied beats (hesitation, tears, placing the pearl). The final renunciation of his hardened stance is earned and carries cost; his contradictory impulses are shown in the moment he both pauses at the door and reaches for the shell. Micro-choices (report vow, pocketing the shell) anchor the change. A few summary phrases edge toward label-speak, but the dominant arc stays specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A single continuous scene under the Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via density of confessions and the final light release. Orientation is immediate. The pearl placement is the decisive Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights meaning of bunkers and his vocation; cost is felt in the “walls dissolve” moment. No causal reversals are needed under the lyric/accumulative mode; the intensification is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting and final throne; iridescent shell, stalagmite, and pearl are tactile objects that constrain placement and ritual. Sensory triage is POV-driven: distant chime, lift of light. Spatial choreography is crisp. The caves mirror internal thaw without overt symbology. Setting allows the final illumination without breaking plausibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preservation of hope inside doomsday preparation. Escalation is tonal/density-driven: each confession layers cost until the pearl illumination reweights survival. No external antagonist; internal pressure suffices at this length. Cost is visible in his shifted inspection vow. Coincidence (shell appears) complicates but does not resolve; it is accepted under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—survival is hollow without shared dreams—emerges through concrete shell images rather than statement. Subtext is carried by gesture (pocketing shell, vow). Final light image answers the question without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether bunkers can ever house hope. Thematic reprise feels specific, not generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight; perceptual signature is inspector-minded (“sterile corridors,” “system operational”). Syntax lengthens slightly under wonder without losing control. No dialogue, so voice is carried by filtered perception. Diction (“resonant hush,” “latent radiance”) creates lyrical texture that is consistent and paid off at the end image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates: shorter beats at hesitation, longer lyric surge at illumination. High density without scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Occasional elevated diction (“iridescent,” “luminous”) is earned by the transcendent moment; no mixed metaphors. Clean comma use; no loops or paraphrase stacks. Final line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Doomsday inspector finding a hope-archive in a crystal cave is fresh synthesis. Conceptual risk—confessions inside seashell spiral—pays off by reweighting the bunker premise. Transformation test fails if shell/plural dreams removed. No close echoes; avoids cliché of redemptive artifact by tying cost to inspector’s vocational pivot.</comment>
