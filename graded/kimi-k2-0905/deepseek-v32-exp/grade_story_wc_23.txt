<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mending vs. confronting—drives every beat; the bronze foot’s pull against her grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices. The final “Listen” renunciation is earned by the linear assembly of soldered memory-wires. Flaw: “geography of loss” drifts toward label-speak twice, muting embodied ache. Still, her patchwork competence balances believable struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each salvaged fragment tightens the resonator and reweights memory-stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—moon-set dimming of the foot—whose conceptual cost (she alone piloted her sorrow) is legible. The 120-word anchor is met: “hydraulics failed… starlit signal station” grounds who-where-when. One causal micro-turn—Polaris alignment—narrows options cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starlit metal island is sketched through action—etching floor-circle, crawling under dead consoles—rather than catalog. Bronze foot’s cool weight and green oxide serve as micro-setting that constrains every alignment choice. Sensory economy favors touch and kinaesthetic scale over visual spectacle, matching claustrophobic grief. Environment silently scripts her只能用 scrap and silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—chart her loss or drown in it—announced early. Single meaningful tightening: Polaris alignment forecloses retreat, visible price is the foot’s fading glow = finite lunar battery. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of memory-fragments escalates risk of psychic implosion. Agency is creation, not escape; cost legible in final dim pulse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of retroactive self-guidance emerges from circuitry, not lecture. Subtext resides in phone’s static—external voice revealed as internal—repricing solitude without declaring it. Motif of “patchwork” evolves from skill to identity, charging closure. Resists moral: ambiguity lingers whether resonance is healing or self-haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical, compressed diction teaches its pattern by line 3; elliptical phrasing paid off in final “Listen.” Perceptual signature is engineer-poet: solder smoke, oxide patina, star-clock angles. No dialogue = no voice contamination. Minor register drift—“geography of loss” abstract noun cluster—barely dents rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with lunar phases; sentence lengths contract during wire-twisting beats. High density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, symbolic labor. No loops, mixed metaphors, or template cadence. “Patina bronze censer foot” repeated with incremental state changes avoids synonym churn while retaining precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reverse migration of memory via scrap-built resonator is fresh hinge on familiar grief-map. Patchwork navigator archetype repurposed as archaeologist of self, not space. Risk—quiet, lyrical ending—pays off with conceptual cost revealed. Could swap star-station for desert outpost, so not irreplaceably specific, but synthesis still feels inevitable.</comment>
