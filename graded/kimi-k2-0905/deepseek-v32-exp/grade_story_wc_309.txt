<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian’s want for “sacred simplicity” is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory choice; interiority drifts toward thematic summary (“he realized…”) rather than embodied pressure. Micro-choices are limited to noticing the keystone and later kneeling—both low-cost observations. The climactic renunciation (letting the cloak fall) is graceful yet causally under-motivated; no prior beat shows why this exact gesture equals commitment. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights the spire’s reality, giving the ending undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain, however, is slack: the keystone’s power is told-not-shown, and the leap from “keystone accommodates impossibilities” to instant verdant transformation is unearned. Orientation is clean; who/where is anchored in first 90 words. One shard/one transition default met; no mosaic or multi-POV issues. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Brilliant dimness” and “icebound spire” are vivid, selective, and thematically apt; sensory balance skews visual but justifies the POV’s mage-aesthetic. Micro-setting (the loose rune-etched stone) constrains discovery and thus choice, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clear; no geography drift. Weather/light remain static but intentionally so, reinforcing stasis theme. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the sacred simple—signaled early, but escalation is textural (density of “dimness” imagery) rather than causal; no option narrows. The keystone discovery feels accidental; mist-walk to garden is summarized, not pressured. Cost is conceptual (automation vs wonder) yet never bites tactically. One visible tightening—keystone glows brighter when planted—but this is effect, not sacrifice. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of anti-automation wonder emerges through image (single frost-kissed flower) rather than lecture, satisfying emergence rule. Final image reweights “brilliant dimness” into living twilight—an elegant CR. Occasional soft thesis lines (“a truth that the automated world had obscured”) flirt with Echo penalty but are brief enough to stay above deduction threshold. Complexity acknowledged: no forced moral balance. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains archaic-yet-lean cadence; diction stays within plausible mage lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Perceptual signature—attention to light, stone, mist—is consistent and character-specific. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm modulates well. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong ear; sentence variety good; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor over-writing in stacked modifiers (“brilliant dimness… perpetual ice… soft, enduring light”) but pattern is taught early and thematically motivated, so no deduction. Information density high; transit compressed efficiently. Closure line clean. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: automation-era ennui meets high-fantasy keystone magic; premise avoids stock quest structure. “Garden folly keystone” repurposes architectural whimsy as reality-bender—specific, memorable. Concept of “lingering luminance” re-imagines twilight as technological after-glow. Transformation test passed: swap keystone for generic orb and thematic charge collapses. Risk modest but coherent. </comment>
