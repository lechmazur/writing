<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes scale cleanly to length; contradictory impulses flicker (“quill trembled… crystallize,” “desperate hope vs. fear”) and micro-choices (pouring tea, speaking the scar aloud) tilt stance. Motive stays singular and legible, but final renunciation is lightly pre-figured—felt cost arrives in the exhalation image rather than a dramatized forfeiture, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the platform steadies and she exhales, releasing crystallized doubts with visible conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-linkage—each rune stroke and memory revisits re-weights the crystallization pattern rather than forcing external turns; the final image reconfigures meaning without soft reset. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (floating stone, tea cup, storm perimeter) surface within 120 words and serve the hush payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment–as-constraint is vivid: the levitating rock limits motion, the storm supplies temporal pressure, and the tea steam acts as micro-anchor that charges the exhalation image. Sensory selection stays urgent—crow-quill tactile detail, crystalline auditory fragility—filtered through rune-scholar POV. Selective economy keeps world-rules implicit yet consistent; no static catalogue. Final image would lose resonance absent the aerial precarity, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—threads every beat; pressure escalates via pattern-deepening (each crystallized rune narrows future options) rather than external reversals. One meaningful tightening: recounting the first failed casting dissolves prior rigidity, enabling the release rune. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the softened swirls; could be sharper if a concrete resource (ink, time, stamina) were visibly depleted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: scars → stories via child-like ritual revisited under adult stress. No moralizing; resonance is image-driven (crystalline forms melt into narrative swirls). Superstition motif (breath-holding, blanket-hiding) reweights at closure, giving conceptual cost to grown-up innocence reclaimed. Complexity stays plausible—no tidy triumph, just stance crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—runes, ink, tea scent filtered through scholar-idolater attention. Rhythm compresses under stress (“She spoke aloud, her voice a mere thread…”) then elongates with breath-hold cadence; no head-hop. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; occasional elevated note (“saturated hush”) reads as intentional atmospheric coinage rather than register drift. Distinctive enough for high band, if not yet irreplaceably singular.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Density high—most sentences perform double duty (action + atmospheric charge). No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; crystallization metaphor stays internally consistent. One paraphrase tic (“held breath” repeated) but spaced enough to avoid drumbeat. Final image clear, propulsive, unpolluted by artifact. Clean copy—pronouns, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope (floating island, rune magic) is refreshed through micro-craft: stress-crystallization as literalized anxiety, tea ceremony as spell chassis. Conceptual inversion—scars become ink, flaws become medium—feels specific to this voice. Risk is moderate; could push further if platform or storm surprised expectation, but execution is thoughtful and non-gimmicky. Synthesis lingers rather than startles.</comment>
