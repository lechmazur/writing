<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—“dual allegiance tore at her,” “methodically planning… trusting the gut”—shows contradictory impulses in scene, and the final graffiti raft cradling the stone earns micro-cost. Yet her emotional range stays oddly calm; no sweat-slick grip on the spray can, no tremor as corporate shadows lengthen, so embodiment under-fulfills the claimed desperation. The role of culture-shock absorber is asserted rather than dramatized through visible interaction with newcomers. Overall, credible but not piercing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: because ships approach → Elara paints; because she paints → meeting is covertly called; closure’s Resonant Reconfiguration (raft-stone fusion) carries felt conceptual cost. Orientation locked by word 60, lens stays situational-pressure. No teleport props, clean. Beat count is thin—only one real action—so escalation is more announced than tested, keeping it out of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Carnival lights on salt-slick boards, magenta spray misting sea-damp wall, child’s sticky fingers—selective, sense-leveraged details that mirror urgency. The perpetual-carnival raft city is more postcard than constraint until the final image when the raft motif is reclaimed in paint; thus environment charges closure but not tactics mid-scene. Spatial choreography clean: wall → spray → child → retreat trackable. Missing one tactile prop-use beat (stone only pocket-rubbed) prevents 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—community survival vs. privatization—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elara’s graffiti schedules the clandestine meeting, foreclosing open protest. Agency sits entirely with her; no coincidence rescues. Cost is conceptual not visceral: she burns the bridge to corporate collaboration by encoding resistance. Visible price would sharpen (a spray-can hiss alerting guards, say) for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. progress emerges organically from the stone fragment and the painted raft; no explicit sermon. Subtext lingers in child spectator—next-gen decoder—yet the carnival’s “hopeful desperation” is named twice, a touch on-the-nose. Final image reweights the premise: sustainability may coexist with remembrance. Complex enough to invite re-reading, but not startlingly fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature sharp—“lights flickered against the twilight,” “scent of fried dough and salt.” Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments when she composes graffiti. No dialogue to test subtext; narration avoids filter verbs. Voice modulation sufficient but not virtuosic; carnival music could rhythm prose more aggressively for 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lean sentences, high density: “The raft city…crowded by a perpetual carnival” packs world, motion, tone in one. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphor. Occasional mild adjective uplift (“vibrant, defiant magenta”) but color serves thematic coding. Final line cadence mirrors opening, closing bracelet neatly. Prose never slows momentum; readability instant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating protest-carnival is fresh; graffiti as clandestine nautical map feels newly specific. Dual allegiance angle complicates usual anti-corporate tale, though internal contradiction stays under-explored. Child witness offers generational twist but remains cameo. Overall, a bright remix rather than a radical reinvention; risk level moderate, execution tidy.</comment>
