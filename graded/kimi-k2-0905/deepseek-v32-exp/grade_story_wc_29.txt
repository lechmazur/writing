<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—scientific detachment vs. messianic urge to shield the town—drives every beat; the moment he bypasses the transmitter, his exhausted body micro-shivers, anchoring cost in flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because the town fractures, therefore Aris risks the illegal burst; the closure is a clean Charged Poise—station is now weapon, Evans’s grudging respect the visible social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Console hum and bone-felt subsonic thrum act as micro-setting; the outdated transmitter knobs constrain tactics and are handled twice, charging the final image of the room as shield.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from abstract civic unrest to immediate career ruin plus possible violence; the illegal broadcast narrows options to one irreversible act whose price (Evans’s fury) lands on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of interpretation vs. manipulation emerges without tags; the charts move from tools of understanding to weapons of counter-broadcast, reweighting meaning in the final silent screen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is filtered through radio tech idiom—waterfall display, subsonic burst—syntax tightens under deadline pressure; no head-hop, distance controlled, perceptual signature distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates with polysyndeton during bypass sequence; no loops or scaffold, only one mixed metaphor (“white noise sea”) that mildly dulls but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: campus radio as defensive weapon against memetic aliens; familiar SETI trope inverted by subsonic low-tech hack, risk paid off in civic calm and career peril.</comment>
