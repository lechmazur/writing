<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is present but drifts into explanatory summary (“he felt the old path circling back”) rather than embodied contradiction. The moment he dissuades the squatter is credible, yet the emotional cost is declared, not dramatized—no visible tremor or breath-catch to make the renunciation felt. The inherited-money motif reweights at the end, but the beat is too compressed to earn full micro-choice hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links “because/therefore” from startup failure → train pilgrimage → warning the squatter → leaving. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of stepping onto unmarked ground reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clean by 60 words; only slip is late-exposition of father’s hiding method that slightly delays stakes. No teleporting props or broken chains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The circus train is textured through Leo’s robber-eye: scuff marks read as territorial grammar, dust smells like old sawdust and crime. Micro-setting works—the foreign bills function as both map and mirror, constraining the final choice to leave them behind. Spatial choreography stays coherent; light through broken boards evolves with dusk, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I break the loop?”—is signaled early and tightens once: warning the squatter forces Leo to enact the answer. Cost is legible: he forfeits the train-as-tomb and the nostalgic currency. Escalation is single-track; no reversal, but the deepening suffices under causal lens. Pressure would sharpen if the squatter pushed back harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of inherited trajectory emerges from concrete objects (foreign bills, scratch marks) rather than thesis. Final image of stepping onto unmarked ground reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: Leo pockets one bill then leaves the rest—an unspoken burial. Ambiguity lingers: cycle may still call, but the stance has crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person limited maintains clean focalization; perceptual signature is consistent—Leo reads space like a thief, noticing exits and warnings. Diction stays in his lexicon except one slip (“technological venture” feels board-room). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments when he spots the squatter. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences double-duty (move + texture). One paraphrase loop: “polished calm” appears three times with diminishing returns. No mixed metaphors, no template cadence. Final paragraph could trim “fragile freedom” to let image speak. Minor scaffold only; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Fresh angle: tech-startup failure as spiritual heirloom to highway robbery. Foreign bills as map-of-flights is specific; not interchangeable. Risk is moderate—quiet exit instead of blaze, but coherence justifies it. Could push further by letting the squatter resist, testing Leo’s calm under threat.</comment>
