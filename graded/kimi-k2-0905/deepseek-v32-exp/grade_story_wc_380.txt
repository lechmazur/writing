<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The private, gnawing need to recover deleted memories is anchored in a concrete relic (pressed wildflowers) and drives every beat; the final floating release in the salt chamber embodies the cost of regaining her past. Interiority is atmospheric rather than diagnostic—gravity tugs mirror emotional weight without label-speak. One flaw: the decision to forget is revealed only in the buried letters, so the prior interior conflict is retroactive rather than simultaneously felt on-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: whale → gravity warps → coffee map → dig → jar → memory return, each adding density until the final gravity collapse reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the floating jar moment makes the cost of recovered grief legible without exposition. Orientation is clear by 70 words; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The salt chamber’s fluctuating gravity literally pins or releases Elara, constraining how she digs and finally cradles the jar; environment shapes tactics. Recurrent “gleaming silence” modulates from eerie to respectful, charging the final lantern image. Tactile halite shards, sideways tugs, and swinging lanterns ground the fantastical rule-set in sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost memories—tightens when coffee dregs narrow the search to one patch of earth; the dig becomes slower or faster as gravity spikes, putting physical price on each scoop. Escalation is textural: each intensified gravity pocket increases emotional weight until the float-release crystallizes the cost of knowledge. No false reversals; coincidence (beached whale) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: deleted memories don’t vanish—they sediment in the world’s hidden folds, waiting like salt-entombed crystals. The parallel between gravity pockets and buried pain reconfigures in the final image of a “tiny, steady gravity” flame, repricing loss as quiet stewardship rather than erasure. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the lantern-line juxtaposed with scattered wildflowers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s bodily experience; perceptual signature favors weight, light, and salt-glint. Prose rhythm mimics fluctuating gravity—long tidal sentences collapse into terse fragments (“jar in hand”) under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; diction remains within a dock-worker’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often paints atmosphere and advances action (“gravity pooled… lanterns swing in erratic arcs”). Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“gleaming silence” recurs with shifting emotional valence). Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold; every paragraph changes knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of beached-whale catalyst with variable-gravity coastline feels fresh; memory-burial in a living salt cave literalizes forgetting as geological process. Specificity of lantern-lighting occupation and coffee-ground divination grounds the speculative concept in lived coastal culture. Without these exact elements the emotional arithmetic collapses, meeting the transformation test.</comment>
