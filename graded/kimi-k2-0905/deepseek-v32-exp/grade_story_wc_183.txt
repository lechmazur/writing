<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—patchwork identity, bodily memory of the carousel horse—but the chimera twin remains abstract; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. The final “herself, whole and aberrant” is declared, not earned by a visible choice that costs her anything. Reflection blocks >20 % yet anchored to present cues, so BRR waived. Voice is consistent, but motivation flattens because the garden never tests her with an either-or.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each narrative thread thickens the fog and the card’s glow, reweighting the stake toward self-acceptance. Closure is a Charged Poise—tapestry of light/sound—whose cost is felt (“trapped freedom”), but the tightening is only one cadence shift; no persistent constraint shapes tactics earlier. Orientation clear by line 5; no penalty. The lens ambiguity at midpoint is waived because closure teaches the pattern.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Peeling carousel horse, damp deck, fog that thickens with each memory—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s alienation. The emerald card as micro-setting constrains her attention and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weather directly limits visibility and forces inward focus, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the garden—signaled early; pressure is situational, tightening once when the card’s pulse hints the garden is near. No meaningful trade-off or forfeiture on the page; escalation is purely atmospheric. Cost is conceptual at closure but not visible in tactics, keeping it sub-7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented identity vs. wholeness emerges from the tape-image and the card’s color shifts, never preached. Final tapestry reweights “forgotten names” into self-acceptance without moralizing. Subtext in “trapped freedom” lingers, though slight thematic echo in final line (−0.2). Overall resonance is quiet but earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical, hypnotic syntax mirrors Elara’s dissolving boundaries; rhythmic control under pressure (“footsteps echoing on the damp wood… fog thickening”) is consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. POV distance stays tight; no filter-verb bloat. Diction within her plausible lexicon; patterned repetition (“narrative threads”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean, high density; sentences double-duty (image + interiority). Minor loop: “narrative threads” phrase repeated four times without new inflection (−0.3). Mixed metaphors (“garden bloom like flowers”) are cliché-adjacent but brief. No artifact touches closure; read-aloud rhythm varies. Precision keeps it above 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chimera twin + abandoned carnival ship is fresh synthesis; memory-garden as light-tapestry is non-literal and memorable. Tropes (fog, carousel) are reanimated through tactile use. Conceptual risk—lyric over causal—pays off in closure image. Could swap “Elara” with another lost name, so not fully irreplaceable, but specific detail lifts it.</comment>
