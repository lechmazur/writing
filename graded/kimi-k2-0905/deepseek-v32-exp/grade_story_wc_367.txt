<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; “shadowed elation” repeats without bodily signature. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he simply knows and laughs. The single micro-choice—adjusting lenses—never risks failure or loss, so the closing stasis feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ascent/lens-tweak intensifies the glow-pattern density toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands—“the world felt poised”—with conceptual cost (storms must destroy to renew). Orientation is clear by line 4; however, “ancient shadows” remain nebulous rules, clipping the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emerald stone, spiral stairs, and refracted light-beam are tactile, purposeful, and mirror Kael’s skewed joy. Lighthouse as micro-setting constrains every move; starlight and salt-spray narrow perception to the tower’s physics. The final emerald spear re-charges the opening image, meeting the 9+ object gate cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide light to foretell/purify—announced early. Escalation is textural (patterns thicken, storm nears) rather than option-narrowing; Kael never considers abandoning post or failing. No visible price alters tactics; energy hums but never imperils, keeping pressure aesthetic, not consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-ruin emerges via light-beam imagery rather than exposition. Final poised dawn reweights earlier “ancient shadows” without sermon. The concept stays oblique enough to invite counter-readings, though repetition of “shadowed elation” edges toward explicit labeling, muting full resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric dense with assonance and maritime diction; perceptual signature filters world through prism/light metaphors. Rhythm escalates from measured clauses to storm-driven fragments, mirroring beam sharpening. Occasional template cadence (“Kael…, the glass wick…, through total…”) knocks it off 9+ tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong nouns/verbs, high density; most sentences twin-load image + motion. Mixed metaphors (“lighthouse heart,” “laughing storm herald”) mildly jar. One paraphrase loop (“ancient shadows…ancient shadows”) and a filter-verb cluster dull immediacy in the climax beat, barring 9+ clearance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fused-quartz optic channeling starlight in a post-newspaper age is fresh world-logic. “Accidentally prophetic” lighthouse keeper synthesizes weather tech and mystic augury, avoiding standard tropes. Risk lies in lyric repetition; without causal jeopardy, premise feels more atmospheric conceit than transformative twist.</comment>
