<comment>Interiority is lush and synesthetic, giving Elara a vivid perceptual signature, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene—she never actively hesitates or recoils mid-echo. The final “bow” is earned by accumulated longing, yet the cost feels abstract because the timeline repair is summarized, not embodied. Still, her ache is specific and consistent, and the tarot coin acts as an externalized want that keeps motives legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo layers density until the orchard itself becomes a proscenium, producing a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s fade into dawn is a Charged Poise where the cost is the irrevocable surrender of ghostly repetition. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the first causal push (coin toss) arrives late; prior stanzas are atmospheric accumulation rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure image is delicate and legible, yet the timeline “snap” is told, not shown, blunting the felt price.</comment>

<comment>The orchard-as-stage micro-setting constrains every beat: trees bend to proscenium shape, silver apples become footlights, garden respiration cues tempo. Synesthetic detail filters through Elara’s urgency—trumpet-blast gold brushes skin—so environment and body merge. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. World rules remain consistent: coin governs echo navigation, garden answers song with light.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—escape ghostly stasis—signals early and tightens when the coin toss risks obliteration; each echo narrows options until only surrender or transcendence remains. Pressure is accumulative: every sensory layer raises nostalgia’s ache and the danger of temporal unraveling. Cost is visible when “the timelines snap,” but the price is cosmic rather than personal, keeping it from the 8.8 band. Agency is pure: only Elara’s song can weave the echoes; no outside rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the returning coin/orchard tandem: art’s impermanence vs. immortal longing. No explicit thesis; meaning is left in the final image of a smiling fade at dawn. Subtext whispers that applause is sweetest when released, not hoarded. The ambiguity—was renewal real or merely consolatory—lingers without confusion, inviting reread.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmic—“weeping violets and hopeful yellows” is both perception and emotion. Syntax grows breathless under pressure, mirroring crescendo. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Diction stays within ghost-poet lexicon; no filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet patterned; metaphor chains are deliberate rather than churn. First two sentences repeat “closed/awakened” in a mild paraphrase loop (−0.2). Otherwise, propulsion is clean; sentence variety and paragraph cuts tighten to musical beats. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; imagery stays coherent under synesthetic load.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—ghost, tarot, orchard—are re-cast through synesthetic performance theory: applause tasted as citrus, timelines as stage-light fractals. The orchard-inside-hedge conceit and echo-weaving method feel fresh, not checklist. Risk in lyric structure pays off: closure remains legible. Slight deduction for near-echo of “echoes bloomed” seen elsewhere, but overall synthesis is memorable.</comment>
