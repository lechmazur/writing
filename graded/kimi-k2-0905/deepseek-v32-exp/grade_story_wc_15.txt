<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyric but generically “poetic,” lacking individual tics or contradictions under pressure; her “haunting optimism” is named repeatedly yet never tested by a moment where she nearly quits or chooses against it, so the attribute feels decal rather than crucible. The sewing is continuous motion but reveals no hierarchy of values—every stitch is equally sacred, so no micro-choice escalates cost. No relationship or secondary figure applies live pressure, so the crucible is purely self-generated; because the self never splits, the arc is smooth, not jagged. Earned stasis is asserted in the final paragraph but not dramatized—she simply stands up, no visible forfeiture or even fatigue—so the cost feels notional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated stitching and glowing lines accrue until the labyrinth “breathes.” Orientation is clear by line 3, causality is loose but permissible under this lens, yet the single tightening (last stitch triggers awakening) is announced rather than shown—no rubble shifts, no sound, no physical cue—so the Decisive Change lacks felt mass. The storybook plate is the only persistent constraint, but its rules are never limited (could she run out of thread? could the image fade?) so tension plateaus. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is abstract (“broken precedents sighed”) rather than personal, keeping the RR short of poignant.</comment>

<comment>Red canyon walls, damp hollows, and tide-pool afterglow are viscerally anchored; the labyrinth’s narrowing corridors and central rubble chamber are spatially tracked. Sensory economy is good—sound is muffled, light is post-tidal, stone is breathing—so atmosphere grows without inventory bloat. The micro-setting of the glazed plate doubles as tool and mirror, charging the ending when it is left as beacon. No world-rule inconsistency, no white-room lapse; the setting could constrain her stride or thread supply more aggressively, but it still shapes her ritual path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“restore sacredness”—are declared early but remain abstract; no external force opposes Elara, and the labyrinth never threatens to reject her. Escalation is purely chromatic: colors brighten, glow increases; no resource dwindles and no option is foreclosed, so pressure is static. The single micro-turn (last stitch → awakening) is textural, not consequential, lacking a visible price. Because coincidence is absent and agency is continuous, the beat sequence is coherent, but it never tightens—only intensifies ambiance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges through the sewing action rather than sermon, achieving quiet resonance. The orchid-solace tone softens ruin into reverence without forcing a moral. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap between reader and character, no unattended shadow in the “reverence” she crafts—so complexity is modest. Final image of the plate left for “future dreamers” is a gentle CR that reweights prior motifs, avoiding overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a calm, incantatory rhythm; diction stays within an arcane but consistent register (“overlapping sleepwalking paths,” “orchid solace”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Elara’s sea-stone sensorium. Slight cadence repetition in “sew… stitching… thread” sentences, but the pattern is taught early and serves mesmeric purpose, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe—length varies, openings rotate, no template runs. A few soft qualifiers (“seemed to sigh,” “felt the orchid solace”) cushion what could be sharper, but they fit the dream-logic mode. Metaphors are coherent (labyrinth as sleeping body) and do not collide. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; information density is high. Could compress two near-restatements of “broken precedents,” but the redundancy does not obscure causality or dull the final glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sacred-space repair via invisible darning is fresh; the sleepwalking-path mechanic literalizes dream-mapping without explanatory dump. Tropes of labyrinth-as-womb and red-canyon-as-heart are familiar, but their fusion with tide-pool ebb and glazed story-plate feels idiosyncratic. Risk is quiet—no structural gimmicks—but specificity of gesture (silver thread catching light like water) keeps the vision memorable. Transformation test passes: swap labyrinth for cathedral or forest and the sewing logic collapses—setting and act are inseparable.</comment>
