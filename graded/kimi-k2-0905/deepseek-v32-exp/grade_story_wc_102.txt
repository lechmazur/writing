<comment>Interiority is lush and camera-specific, but the healing quest is declared rather than dramatized through contradiction; the breathing mechanic is used as observation, not a micro-choice that costs her anything. The “unused love” metaphor is reiterated instead of tested by a conflicting want. Still, the embodied pacing of breath-to-image keeps her from sliding into label-speak and the final fusion of artist/healer is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last spark-release re-weights the premise—love was never lost, only stored—with luminous, undeniable cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; each breath-tuned revelation deepens pattern rather than narrows option, but the final dissolving strand makes the before/after legible. Orientation is taught early and kept; no props teleport. Meets 9+ quick test save for the soft causal lens; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct’s wisteria-draphed stones act as both cathedral and camera-darkroom: proximity dictates where she can stand to focus, while ivy-clefts literally hide the tear. Twilight color-shift mirrors her internal fog-to-clarity arc, and the “silvery strands” between stones supply the only path she can walk to ignite stored love. Micro-setting (camera box, tear) constrains each next move; no static postcarding. Final spark-drift is charged by the place itself, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locate and release orphaned love—is signaled in paragraph two and steadily intensifies as each strand ignites. Pressure is accumulative: every exhalation reveals another reservoir, deepening emotional density rather than narrowing external options. Cost is present (the tear burns out, her past-life ache softens), but the tightening is cadence-based, not a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. Meets 8.2 bar for lyric escalation; lacks a visible price that alters later tactics, keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of exhaling light into abandoned affection; no overt thesis statements. The twilight viaduct becomes a quiet argument that compassion can be archived and re-circulated, a notion re-priced by the final spark-drift. Ambiguity is coherent—reader can read the sparks as literal magic or psychological integration without forced moral. Only minor echo of “pilgrim of sparks” label near end keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly moored to Elara’s perceptual camera—every noun is something she could frame or inhale. Syntax lengthens and narrows with her breathing rhythm, teaching the pattern early; no head-hop. Diction stays within an artist-healer lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulation under pressure is present—short staccato observations when she first touches the tear, then elongated clauses as sparks rise. Distinctive enough for 9-band but for one soft template cadence in the closing gratitude list.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene: clause length literally expands and contracts to mimic inhale/exhale without drum-beat repetition. Figurative vehicles (wisteria as incense, sparks as unmailed letters) are spare, consistent, and paid off. No paraphrase loops; every sentence either advances the next strand-discovery or re-tones the air. One strained mixed metaphor—“forgotten tide” beside “sealed letter”—prevents 9.0, but it does not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines camera-obscura craft, past-life trope, and Buddhist artifact into one coherent metaphysical repair job; feels organic rather than checklist. The notion of “unused love” as a literal spatial deposit hidden in civic architecture is fresh, non-obvious, and emotionally credible. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation instead of conflict—but the synthesis is memorable and the closure would collapse if any ingredient swapped. Does not reach 8.5 because the breathing-reveal mechanic is precedented in mindfulness lit.</comment>
