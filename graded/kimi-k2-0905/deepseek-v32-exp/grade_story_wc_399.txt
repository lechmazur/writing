<comment>Kael’s “strangely honest” trait is asserted repeatedly but never shown complicating a choice (no moment where candor costs him). Interiority is generic (“he felt compelled,” “his motivation…transformed”) rather than body-level or contradictory. The mask is a striking visual but never limits perception or social risk; removing it at the end reads cosmetic. Preservation drive is clear, yet no micro-choice on the page is jeopardized by that desire—consecration succeeds without trade-off.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the echo-field stabilizes and Kael resumes watch—mood shift legible, but no new constraint or price is dramatized. Causal chain is present (parapet rises because echoes are summoned) yet escalation is flat—each attempt succeeds on first try, flattening tension. Orientation is swift; no spatial or temporal disorientation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but final cadence repeats earlier beats without reweighting stakes.</comment>

<comment>“Murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm,” and grinding stone serpent provide tactile, auditory specificity that is filtered through Kael’s attention to resonance. Sand-dune vastness is kept offstage; setting contracts to pavilion floor and parapet curve—economy that keeps choreography clean. Temperature of stone and rhythmic motion are returned to at closure, giving the kinetic parapet a micro-setting role. Early anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation penalty.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—echo preservation—is signaled early and achieved without obstacle; therefore pressure feels declarative rather than tested. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no risk realized; success is iterative, not contested. The single “tightening” is the parapet breaching sand, but it immediately enhances calm rather than narrows choices. Cost is absent on the page; consequence is purely affirmative.</comment>

<comment>Theme of stewardship-through-honesty emerges implicitly via repetition of “echo” and “clearing,” avoiding overt thesis. Subtext is thin because conflicts are benign; nevertheless, the final image of calm as living legacy invites reflection. No moralizing sentence caps the piece; resonance arises from sustained calm rather than declaration. The calm-vs-wilderness motif remains modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Kael’s sensory funnel; perceptual signature is consistent (“peripheral awareness” as habitual verb). Syntax is lightly incantatory, mirroring chant-like mission; repetition of “whisper,” “echo,” “clearing” functions as ritual cadence, not monotony. No dialogue to distort voice. Register remains within plausible mystic-caregiver lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Psychic distance holds—no head-hop, no mid-paragraph drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; only minor paraphrase pairs (“whisperfield calm…fading echoes of wisdom”) appear. Metaphors stay consistent (echo, resonance, stone serpent) without self-contradiction. No scaffold sentences or template cadence detected. Opening and final lines anchor and echo effectively. High-density lines carry simultaneous world-data and emotional charge, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Concept of “sound preserved by moving wall” is fresh; combination of acoustic mysticism and kinetic architecture avoids standard desert tropes. Execution, however, is risk-averse—every invented mechanic cooperates instantly, muting surprise. Prophet remains offstage, reducing potential ideological friction. Specificity is present but not startling; swap “echo” for “memory” and plot still functions, indicating moderate rather than deep transformation.</comment>
