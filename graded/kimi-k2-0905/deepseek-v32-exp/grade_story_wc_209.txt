<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet drive is repeatedly named but only once dramatized—she walks to the cathedral—so the attribute feels asserted rather than tested. Interiority drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“reckoned with the silence of her own heart”) that could belong to any sensitive artist. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her choices; she glides from curiosity to comprehension without friction. The closure image is lovely but arrives as revelation bestowed, not decision earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers postcards, window light, and seasonal turns until the hidden glass image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by word 80; the single time-jump (winter→spring) is signaled and motivation restated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—moon-flowers as conversation—but the cost is purely contemplative; nothing is foregone or risked, so the “felt” bar is barely cleared. The plot is a gentle spiral, not a tightening; that suffices for this lens but keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, autumn leaf drift, and cathedral glass are economically re-used; each new slant of light changes what Elara can see, so setting directly enables discovery. Sensory balance favors visual, but the visual is plot-functional, not decorative. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, postcards, window angle track logically. The pavilion’s filtered glow returns in the final image, charging the mural’s starlit flowers with remembered light, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Central stake—understanding night bloom—remains conceptual; pressure is epistemic, not consequential. Escalation is accumulative: each postcard and glass layer adds density but never narrows lived options or exacts a price. The only “turn” is the sun angle revealing the etched flowers, an external gift rather than an earned reversal. Because no path is foreclosed and no resource lost, tension stays mild, adequate for a lyrical quest but short of the 8+ band that requires visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: flowers greet the moon because darkness is a gentler, necessary light. The cathedral glass literalizes the grandmother’s aphorism without moralizing; the children’s wonder refracts the insight back to the reader. Subtext operates in hush and glow rather than assertion. Final image avoids thesis-statement, lets mural stand as answer, achieving modest resonance without forcing universality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distances just enough to let metaphor breathe; diction stays within an artist’s ken (“umbral tenderness,” “starlit tapestry”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dusk hush, shorter bursts for discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) are soft but not clustered under pressure; overall texture is controlled and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, and image-dense; no scaffolding or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—light, glass, bloom form one consistent field. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-echo motif. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing,” “earned stasis”) appears only in rubric language, not in story proper, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Night-blooming flowers as moon correspondence is a fresh inflection on a known motif; etching them in cathedral glass gives local specificity. Postcard-to-grandmother thread personalizes the botanic mystery, resisting encyclopedic detachment. Story avoids sentimentality by keeping revelation contemplative rather than triumphant. Risk is modest—lyric accumulative structure—but execution is confident, so originality lands above mid-tier.</comment>
