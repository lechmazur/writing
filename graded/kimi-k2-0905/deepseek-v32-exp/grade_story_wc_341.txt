<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is cloud-cataloguing abstraction rather than embodied crisis; the “quietly explosive” label is repeated but never manifests as believable physiological or contradictory thought. His mission stays static—no micro-choice under pressure tests or revises his drive—so the climactic “catalog complete” feels foregone, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cloud entry thickens the memorial texture toward a Charged Poise finale. Yet the piece misses a meaningful tightening beat; stakes never escalate past the initial drift, so the closure carries概念ual rather than felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Gondola, telescope, and thin-air sensation anchor every beat; brass chills the hand, deck sways underfoot, cloud types filter through professional gaze. Selective meteorological diction keeps the sky from becoming mere backdrop, though the environment never physically constrains or endangers Elias enough to charge the finale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove void remembers—is declared early but never tested by a genuine reversal or resource loss; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure plateaus at “label another cloud,” so escalation is iterative, not causally intensifying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-absence emerges via cloud taxonomy, avoiding overt thesis until the near-end “library” line. Still, the insight circles one quiet epiphany without counter-readings or moral friction, yielding gentle rather than complex resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s meteorologist eye, diction seeded with cirrus/cumulus/anvil specificity. Filter-verb clusters (“he thought,” “he felt”) blunt immediacy in peak beats, and cadence becomes hypnotically uniform, but voice remains coherent and purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high—nearly every sentence—creating a lullaby cadence that fits the drift but dulls urgency; mixed strands (thread/bobbin + library + dusty starlight) coexist without contradiction yet accrue slight fog. Template stem “He [verb]” repeats across consecutive sentences, dampening propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cloud-classification-as-memorial is a fresh emotional angle on lyric sky-gazing; combining meteorologist expertise with grief taxonomy feels specific, inevitable in hindsight. Risk is modest—no structural daring—so originality stems from disciplined synthesis rather than bold inversion.</comment>
