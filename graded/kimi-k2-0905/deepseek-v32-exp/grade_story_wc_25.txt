<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “uncanny ability” is asserted rather than dramatized; the walk-recognition never fails or costs her anything, so the trait feels ornamental. Her interiority is concrete—folding the map, palming the coin—but the moment of softening Kael is told in summary (“his eyes widened… seeming to calm him”) instead of shown through micro-reactions. The final quiet triumph is earned by the story’s logic of whispers, yet the absence of any mistake or visible price keeps her just below the 8-band where genuine struggle would reside.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm kills tech → map and gait-skill become crucial → coin and key win Kael → hidden relay proves creed. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “she had proven that whispers… travel farther than shouts,” reweighting the premise with social cost (Kael converted, workers saved). One hairline slip: the key’s metaphor status is declared late, not seeded, so the hinge feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is tactile—seam traced, panel swung, relay humming—each detail either enables or obstructs action. Geomagnetic storm supplies shifting light that disorients Kael and justifies tech failure, charging the final image as the green fades to predawn gray. Micro-setting (map folds, coin weight) doubles as tool and atmosphere, passing the 9+ gate by constraining the last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—prove quiet mastery—tightens when Kael blocks her path; the coin/handover is the visible pivot that turns enforcer into witness. Cost is present but soft: Kael’s aggression dissolves, yet Elara risks no personal loss beyond exposure. Escalation is steady under Causal lens, though the absence of a backward step or tangible price keeps it from the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through rival communication modes: brittle digital shout vs. resilient human whisper. The zodiac coin rebalances power, the key-without-lock literalizes “finding openings,” and the storm-lit maze externalizes information noise. Final sentence crystallizes the reconfiguration without sermonizing, but the absence of counter-evidence—no moment where a whisper fails—makes the creed feel slightly monolithic rather than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close sticks to Elara’s perceptual filter: storm-light, gait signatures, paper fiber. Syntax flexes from clipped (“She unfolded a creased paper map”) to fluid when she moves, mirroring her calculated spontaneity. No head-hop; Kael’s inner shift is inferred strictly from his softened walk, maintaining distance control. Voice achieves quiet lyricism without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, rhythmic, dual-duty: “storm-lit darkness” marries atmosphere to obstacle; “whisper can navigate where a shout cannot” compresses theme into propulsion. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors; only two adjacent sentences begin with “She,” a trivial cadence echo. Read-aloud ear test passes; final paragraph slows into cadence release that mirrors waning storm without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: port-container maze + geomagnetic jam + gait-recognition yields a near-future fable about signal vs. body. Coin-as-libra and key-without-lock risk symbol overkill, yet both are handled as tactile props rather than concept decals. Gimmick level is moderate; risk doesn’t fully heighten stakes but keeps the premise from feeling generic. Not quite revelatory, yet memorably specific.</comment>
