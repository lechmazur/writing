<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is granular and embodied—her fingers feel the “brass cog…heavy in her pocket” and her thoughts loop through “whirlpool of doubt and determination.” The “rationally rebellious” trait drives every micro-choice (rejecting superstitions, scraping charts, inscribing metal scraps) with visible cost (further isolation, physical exhaustion). No epiphany is declared; instead, her resolve crystallizes in the final beat of “abrasive calm,” a credible endurance that forecloses silence. The only minor slip is the abstract label “philosopher” which is never tested in dialogue with another mind, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final brass plate of tidal equations reweights the premise—truth can still be quarried from ruins—while the cog’s glint carries undeniable conceptual cost (a lifetime of lonely labor). Causality is causal-accumulative hybrid: each scraped layer tightens her mandate and narrows her social future. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 7 and never slips. Minor ellipsis: we never see the surface faction she allegedly dismantled, so the tightening is slightly off-stage, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sewer strata and brass artifacts are handled, not catalogued—every tool (trowel, cog, plate) constrains posture, pace, and breath. Spatial choreography is immaculate: distance to crack-light, sediment under nails, shelf hewn from rubble. Sensory hierarchy favors mineral damp and metallic tang, never tourist spectacle. The micro-setting of “brass cog vs. clay-fused chart” becomes the decisive arena where navigation truth is literally pried loose; thus the 9-band gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve empirical navigation—is signaled in para 1 and tightens each time sediment resists or yields. The mid-story brass-plate discovery is the single meaningful escalation: it proves her rebellion is not delusion, foreclosing resignation. Cost is visible—knuckles raw, social credit zero—but the off-stage factions never physically confront her, so pressure is intellectual more than visceral, capping at 8.3.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image of layered time (city strata, cog teeth, chart fragments) arguing that knowledge is stratified, not cyclical or divine. No moral is stated; the final image of tidal equations silently reprices superstition as sediment to be scraped away. Subtext is carried in gesture—she “does not smile,” letting the brass glint speak. The concept-driven CR lands cleanly, but the absence of a living antagonist keeps resonance one note shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: syntax is angular, clauses chipped like stone (“abrasive calm,” “geometric perfection”). No head-hop; temporal jumps are ellipsis, not slippage. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (no corporate register). Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during scraping beats, breathes longer in reflection. One minor tic: four sentences begin “She…” in a 60-word stretch; pattern is not taught, so −0.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—scraping action teaches world rule while revealing emotional thrust. No paraphrase loops; metaphor is sparse and precise (“mind a whirlpool”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-miss: “weight of that struggle in her bones” borders cliché, but immediate sensory follow-up (“grinding pressure”) rescues it. Clean grammar, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-plague sewer archaeologist who fights myth with tidal math. The brass cog as both character talisman and epistemic key feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk taken—entire plot is solitary excavation—pays off by making sediment itself the antagonist. No derivative echoes; trope of “lone truth-keeper” is retooled through stratum-by-stratum empiricism. Lacks the final audacious spark for 9.5 but well above standard.</comment>
