<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s solitude, ancestral craft, and sudden pivot to star-chasing build a credible arc; the “blessed pariah” identity is asserted rather than dramatized, so status pressure never tests him in scene. Interiority is concrete—compass rose warmth, stylus urgency—but the shutdown’s emotional cost is told more than embodied. Final choice is earned by family custom and star fixation; still, the absence of any live opposition keeps the crucible cool.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: anniversary custom → sketch → anomalous star → sensor re-aim → vow to burn engines. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—he abandons post for cosmic north—cost is the forsaken duty, felt when he “turns from the window.” One continuous scene keeps scope tight; orientation anchored by word 50. Minor lapse: star’s unmoving physics never explained, but miracle accepted under SF compact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Deck, dead machinery, and liquid-drift starfield are sketched with sensory economy; body micro-setting (gilded cuff warming) doubles as emotional barometer. Time-dilated silence is environment and tone engine, narrowing perception to breath and hum. Tools—datapad, stylus, auxiliary sensors—are handled in goal-directed motion that charges the final image. No spatial slippage; world-rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find purpose in silence”—is signaled early; pressure rises as the star fixes his longing and the engine plan crystallizes. Tightening beat is the recalibration of sensors: one live action that forecloses passive waiting. Cost is opportunity-loss of safe station-keeping, but no concrete obstacle or resource limit complicates the scheme; hence escalation feels internal more than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of navigation—ancestral, technological, existential—emerges through star-mapping and compass rose without overt thesis. Family custom and stellar fix reconfigure isolation into quest; final image of “echoed silence” now echoes departure, not void. Subtext of legacy versus lone agency lingers unsummarized. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is engineer-stargazer hybrid—precise sensor jargon beside mythic star-calling. Rhythm swells with lengthened sentences under time-dilation, contracts during stylus strokes. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor restrained and POV-apt (“starfield…liquid motion”). Voice distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet atmospheric; sentences vary in length to mimic temporal stretch without pattern fatigue. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density high—“gilded compass rose applique” does triple duty as heirloom, tactile anchor, and thematic reprise. Peak beat (sensor recalibration) keeps clarity under pressure. Minor elevation: “temporally stretched air seeming to thin” flirts with abstraction but earns lyric effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Shutdown-astronaut turned star-pilgrim freshens the marooned-in-space trope; family star-sketch customs and time-dilated perception give cultural specificity. Compass rose as both heirloom and navigational key is an elegant fusion. Risk level moderate—linear vignette, no structural experiment—but execution confident. Not groundbreaking, yet avoids cliché through sensory detail and personal ritual.</comment>
