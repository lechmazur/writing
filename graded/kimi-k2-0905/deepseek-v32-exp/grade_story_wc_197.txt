<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet-archivist persona is sketched economically, but interior contradiction is asserted (“underestimated rebel”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The key-driven actions are coherent, yet no micro-choice under live pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—the plan unspools too smoothly. Emotional embodiment stays at arm’s length; we are told he “felt desperation creeping in,” but the body never betrays him. Closure is a narrated victory, not an on-page renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels administratively complete rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage is present yet slack: the puddle-map coincidence complicates but never genuinely endangers; the key instantly unlocks voices without prior obstacle. Orientation is clean—city, dusk, library, lagoon anchored by word 60. The closure beat (withdraw key, figures fade, stories “live within him”) is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights memory itself, but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on Kael’s body or choices. Persistent constraint (key as bridge) is named, yet never shapes tactics under pressure, so the lens holds but the tightening is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—“shimmering water,” “rust-rimmed phone booth,” “weeping willows”—is filtered through Kael’s archivist gaze and stays economical. Weather and urban decay subtly guide route choice, meeting the 9+ gate that environment constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The lagoon’s gold glow reappears at closure, charging the final image, though the city’s geography outside the reflection map remains schematic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early: preserve truth vs. Council erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hidden archive plan “begins to unravel,” but the puddle-map arrival immediately neutralizes the threat, so pressure plateaus rather than narrows options. Agency is present—Kael records, shares, plants doubt—but no on-page loss (time, safety, social credit) is paid or felt. Escalation is accumulative/image-driven rather than causal-endangering; the cost is conceptual, not tactical, limiting entry to high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image pattern: reflection → resurfacing truth. Subtext resides in the key’s obsolete corporeality—obsolete tech harbors unobsolete memory. Final image (stories “ripple in stagnant waters”) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. No echoing of prompt labels inside the text keeps the concept unspoken yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is consistent—bookish, light-focused, map-minded. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts under starlight. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is immediate. Register never drifts into committee voice; archivist diction justifies elevated yet precise word choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“auric lagoon,” “coded freedom”—without purple overload. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or action. Opening and closing lines are crisp, with the final “ripple” line supplying propulsive send-off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The puddle-reflection map as literal navigation device is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of urban-fantasy and archival heist. Tropes (rebel archivist, ghost historians) are re-grounded in tactile objects: rusted booth, obsolete key. Conceptual repricing of memory as liquid/call-tone feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric escalated structure—but coherence holds, meriting upper-band originality.</comment>
