<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—idealist vs. soul-patcher—stays vivid; the burned card and root-bone contact externalize her need. The keeper’s single line of opposition is enough to force her micro-choice of surrender, so the relationship crucible works. “Fiercely gentle” is shown twice (hand on card, settling among roots) but never complicates or costs her—no wound, no forfeiture—so the flaw stays ornamental. Cost is felt only obliquely; the final “quiet healing” is asserted, not embodied, keeping her arc just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the card swallowed by fresh roots reconfigures meaning with visible cost—she renounces control. Accumulative lens holds: each bone-and-root image tightens the emotional density until the final weave. Keeper’s warning functions as pattern-break that shifts her from forcing to listening; causality intact. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3, corridor glow recurs as clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop—root-bone lattice literally grips the card, constraining her final gesture. Sensory economy obeys POV: amber-gray glow narrows to card, ribs, soil under fingers. “Soil woven with ancient remains” teaches the world rule early; no exposition dump. Micro-setting (rib cradle) doubles as altar, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she force redemption or receive it—signals in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each root-and-bone tableau tightens the emotional cost until she yields. No external reversals, but the keeper’s single line acts as deepening that flips her method from domination to surrender. Price is conceptual—she forfeits the fantasy of mastering time—but the lack of tangible loss keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning cannot be coerced; it must be surrendered to. Subtext lives in gesture—roots tighten only after she lets go. No final moralizing; last image of card swallowed by living wood reweights “bartered destinies” without comment. Ambiguity lingers: is the orchard’s acceptance mercy or mere indifference?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“glow of half-lit corridors painted the air in shades of amber and gray”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Syntax mirrors her obsessive inlaying: long sentences braid clauses like roots. No dialogue contamination; keeper’s line is sparse, archaic, distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer clauses while she kneels, shorter fragments at rustle/keeper entrance. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Metaphors stay vegetal-bone, coherent within world logic. One register drift—“trammeled the flow of time itself” dips into grandiosity but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard plus tarot necromancy is fresh synthesis; not a stock dark-fantasy set. Conceptual risk—lyric surrender instead of triumph—pays off. Could use one more specific folkloric detail to feel inevitable. Derivative echo only in “trammel” diction, not premise.</comment>

<question9 A</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Her reckless idealism drives every beat: bartering, kneeling, final surrender. Without it, no story.</question>
<question9 B</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Burned card handled in opening, mid-scene rib placement, final root ingestion—each reweights meaning.</question>
<question9 C</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Bartered destinies shape her initial shame and final surrender; concept charges stakes throughout.</question>
<question9 D</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Fiercely gentle enables card handling and root settling, but never costs her skin—stays soft.</question>
<question9 E</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>“Trammel” names her goal and final surrender; synonym could not survive without rewriting arc.</question>
<question9 F</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Inlaying meaning is her method in every paragraph; failure forces the final shift to acceptance.</question>
<question9 G</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Bone-laced soil literally grips the card; setting is antagonist and ally—irreplaceable.</question>
<question9 H</question><grade>5.3</question><comment>Glow corridors create mood but never tighten a clock; time remains elastic.</question>
<question9 I</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Soul-patching desire launches and closes the arc; renunciation is the price.</question>
<question9 J</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dusky resolve modulates from frantic to serene; final image crystallizes the tone shift.</question>
