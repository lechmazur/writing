<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet obsession” is stated, but her interiority is mostly generic scholar-poet. The final decision to speak is forecast early yet arrives without new contradiction or micro-cost; the only embodied beat is the “rare, gentle curve” of a smile—too late to ratchet pressure. Reticence is told, not dramatized in her body or micro-gestures under the chandelier. Motivation is clear but never complicated by a visible flaw or stakes that could be lost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing: language is shown as alive again, dawn-light refracted through the crystal. Cost is present—the scholar’s voice and the library’s ossified dogma are both broken open—but the causality is soft: the crystal simply “testifies” rather than forcing a choice that could fail. Accumulated lyric texture does reweight the stake, satisfying Accumulative closure. Orientation is clear by word 60, but the drive lens is declared “Accumulative/Textural” and stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The chandelier crystal functions as micro-setting: it is handled, tapped, and finally held aloft, constraining the only possible action in a dead library. Dust, gloom, and piercing dawn-light are filtered through Elara’s scholar-attention, giving sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible object positions. The crystal’s reflected rainbows charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the broader library remains slightly generic “cathedral” furniture; hence 8.3 not 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove language still breathes—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: fracturing sound becomes a “heartbeat.” The escalation is Accumulative (density of sonic shards) rather than a narrowing of actionable options; no visible price (time, reputation, bodily risk) is paid. The scholar’s agency is purely epistemic; the library imposes no external jeopardy. Enough for a single tightening, but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the living pulse of language is re-ignited through light and vibration, not thesis. The crystal’s final chime is a non-literal answer to “can words still grow?”—a resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing final line; the smile is image, not message. Subtext is carried by silence and refracted light, giving durable ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, cathedral rhythm that mirrors the “suspended hush.” Diction stays within a scholar’s lexicon; metaphorical layering (“skeletal chandelier,” “auditory pictures”) is consistent and pattern-taught. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is coherent—“towering shelves draped in gloom” is a scholar’s spatial map. Slight syntactic monotony in repeated “she” anaphora keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with the sonic beats. Figurative language is dense but serves the Accumulative lens; no mixed metaphors. Two paraphrase loops (“fractured sequences… sonic shards… broken sounds”) overlap conceptually; a −0.2 loop penalty applies. Information density is high; opening line anchors stakes cleanly. No typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “language is dormant, not dead” premise is fresh against the declared end-of-lexicography era. Crystal-as-linguistic-stethoscope is a specific, non-obvious tool that charges closure. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulation instead of plot pyrotechnics—but coherent. Could swap any cloistered archive for the library, so setting freshness is moderate. Overall, a thoughtful synthesis rather than a radical invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Her reticence is introduced early and finally broken, but the break is single-beat and costless; no relationship or status pressure tests it. Serves one turn—speaks aloud—hence mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Handled in discovery, tapping, and final aloft beats; its sonic property enables the entire decoding sequence and charges the dawn-light rainbow at closure. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The hush is seeded in paragraph 1, deepens at the tuning-fork moment, and “breaks” into renewal at the end. It shapes atmosphere and the final cadence shift, though it never constrains a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Sonically reflective” is not mere label; the trait drives the fracturing-echo mechanic that reveals the growth pattern. Without it, no plot. Cost is implicit: the scholar risks hearing nothing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Testify is the culminating action that externalizes her discovery. It reconfigures the library from tomb to womb, but arrives late and is lightly dramatized—hence solid not top tier.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fractured sequences are referenced early, demonstrated mid-story via tuning-fork splinters, and carry the final heartbeat revelation. Method is taught, repeated, and payoff-linked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Shadowed library supplies the gloom/light polarity and the crystal source, but does not physically obstruct or resource any tactical move; more backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><<grade>4.7</question>
<comment>“After the last dictionary” is stated once and never leveraged as a ticking clock or cultural sanction; it frames era but does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Decode growth motive initiates action, survives the failure-of-silence risk, and culminates in the voiced testimony. friction—voicelessness vs need to speak—carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Weathered innocence is established in her “enduring hope and intellectual weariness” and modulates into the rare dawn-smile. Tone stays consistent, but the innocence does not complicate or limit her choices under pressure; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>
