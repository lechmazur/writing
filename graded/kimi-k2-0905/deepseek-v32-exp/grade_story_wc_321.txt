<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eli’s resilient optimism is embodied in steady micro-choices—tuning the radio, tilting the hourglass—so the trait steers action, not slogan. Interiority stays concrete (“jumbled and distant” memories under sideways time). Final stance costs him the grotto itself, a clean Earned Stasis. Missing is any contradictory impulse that would complicate his ardent nature under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: grotto dissolves, ferry rematerializes, cost is the loss of the pocket-realm. Causal chain—hourglass angles + radio voices → pattern alignment → merger—holds throughout. Orientation is anchored within 40 words; lens is causal. Only nitpick: “permanent transient” is named, not dramatized, slightly softening the conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto is more than postcard: starlight angles determine hourglass rotation, stalactites become tether points for timeline threads. Micro-setting (hourglass, radio) constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography is crisp—pools, planks, beams of light track cleanly. Sensory palette is narrow (cold, damp, silver) but purposeful; tight focus fits 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single stake—restore the ferry—tightens when sideways time narrows memory, forcing a now-or-never alignment. Escalation is one continuous crescendo: static → faint voice → chorus → merger. Price is the grotto’s erasure, legible on page. No secondary pressure or resource lost mid-process, so intensity plateaus once the chorus arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair-through-persistence emerges from iterated radio calls and light angles, never sermonized. “Permanent transient” risks thesis-statement but is redeemed when the grotto’s dissolution makes transience the price of permanence. Subtext lives in mirrored Elis—voiceless dialogue that implies infinite failure. Final image reweights hourglass from relic to loom shuttle, a quiet conceptual repricing.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eli’s perceptual filter: salt-rough fingers, sideways memory slippage. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens during alignment—“He moved the hourglass slowly” to “With a final adjustment”—mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Distorted radio voice is distinct by diction alone (“I hear you” layered with static), fulfilling voice-distinction test without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filler verbs, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“time felt like a river flowing in every direction” is the single simile, earned. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for starlight catalog, staccato for radio exchanges. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, satisfying ear-test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Timeline-scattered ferry as inciting loss is fresh; hourglass-as-lens-node repurposes a tired symbol. Risk of abstraction is offset by tactile handling and mirrored Elis, grounding the conceit. The “sideways clock” rule is taught early and obeyed. Not quite transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight, but avoids stock tropes cleanly.</comment>
