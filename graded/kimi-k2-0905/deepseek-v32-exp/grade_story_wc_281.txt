<comment>Alex’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in the tension between his tender motive (recover Mara) and his methodical, self-interrogating recall; the micro-choices—picking up the geode, selecting somatic anchors, translating them into light—track a credible interior arc. The final act of packing the geode shows earned renunciation: he accepts the fragility of “willowglass hope” rather than claiming miracle. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic clichés. The only minor drag: “affectionate skeptic” is never allowed to contradict itself in live scene with Mara, so the contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the finished light-map image crystallizes options (he can keep trying, knowing the bridge is tenuous) with undeniable emotional cost—this reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: pill → somatic recall → light translation → gift of map; each beat adds density. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words. One minor causality fuzz: the geode’s “pulse” is given tiny agency without prior rule cue; since it doesn’t solve the problem, the slip is decorative, not structural.</comment>

<comment>Light studio anchors every tactical choice—darkness required for long exposure, LED wand as brush, pedestal placement refracting geode layers; environment directly constrains how recall is translated into image. Micro-setting (geode sliver) doubles as tactile tool and optical prism, charging the closure image. Sensory selection skews visual, but it matches the profession and stakes; other senses enter via somatic markers (warmth of hand, cool shade). No spatial drift; body–camera–pedestal positions track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</answer>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve shared memories before they vanish—tightens once: from vague hope to concrete visual map that forecloses endless searching. Under Accumulative lens, density rise (each light sweep = one more neuron-like trace) reweights cost; failure risk remains live. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external victory, fitting short form. Price is time, stamina, and the visible fragility of the final image; no larger loss required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as reparable yet fragile mosaic—emerges through recursive light patterns instead of commentary; final “willowglass hope” image offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier skepticism. Subtext resides in gesture: the act of lighting darkness stands in for the impossibility of full retrieval. No moralizing sentence or prompt echo. Thematic ambiguity stays productive: reader must decide whether the map is medicine or mere testament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Alex’s perceptual filter: fractal metaphor, tactile geode layers, synesthetic recall of forest light. Psychic distance breathes appropriately—compressed during LED sweeps, widened in final reflection. Syntax mirrors methodical mindset (parallel participle phrases) yet flexes under emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests entirely on interior diction; it avoids generic therapy register. One tiny register lift—“willowglass” neologism—earns its keep by appearing in closure image.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries high info density: single sentences layer action, sensory data, and metaphor (“Each sweep of light was a neural pathway made visible”). Figurative language is selective; no sentence-level overcrowding. Rhythm varies: long lyrical clauses build texture, short fragments mark peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif. Minor alliteration (“willowglass hope”) is purposeful, not decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of telepathy pill + somatic markers + light-painting translation feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; concept grows from character’s profession rather than gimmick. Risk taken: memory recovery rendered as visual art artifact—could have felt twee, but specificity of geode optics and fractal metaphor grounds it. No familiar trope echo; premise would collapse if elements swapped. Transformation test passes: story fails without exact geode-to-light pipeline.</comment>
