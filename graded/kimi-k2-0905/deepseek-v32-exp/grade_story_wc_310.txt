<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet enthusiasm” is shown through ritual coin-casting and iterative listening; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. vocation) run in parallel but don’t tighten further; final stance feels more confirmed than transformed. No second character means status/relationship bullets N/A; micro-choices visible, but cost is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of casting → static decoding → memory dive → map coins; each beat thickens texture and reweights stake. Closure is Charged Poise: “She aligned her wavelength… beacon of hope” crystallizes options with cosmic cost. Orientation, causality, and transition clean; no prop or knowledge teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambered deck, obsidian table, and foreign coins supply tactile micro-setting that constrains ritual motion. Spatial logic stable; sensory detail selective (clink, static crackle, amber light). Coins as recurring object charge final map image, satisfying 9+ gate. Slight repetition of “ambered” and “static” without fresh sensory twist keeps score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can meaning be distilled from post-contraction silence?—is clear early; pressure escalates via pattern breaks (new coin sequence, intensifying static). Agency is attention/interpretation rather than external battle; cost is existential uncertainty absorbed into final stance. One meaningful tightening sufficient; cost legible as conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical memory/beacon emerges from iterative acts, not exposition. “End is beginning” reweights prior beats via backwards-prophecy payoff; no final moralizing. Ambiguity (is the beacon real or self-soothing?) lingers legitimately. Coins’ cultural plurality silently underwrites unity-through-diversity subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical mode, stable distance; diction (“ambered,” “wavelength align”) stays within mystic-science register Elara could plausibly internalize. Rhythm modulates: long mantle-like sentences intercut with single-line castings. No dialogue to test naturalism; minimal filter verbs. Some template cadence in repeated “She cast… She distilled…” but pattern feels ritual, not mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong nouns/verbs, minimal scaffolding; occasional modifier stacks (“golden haze,” “cosmic silence”) verge on purple but stay coherent. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Minor paraphrase loops (“distill the essence,” “distill wisdom”) in closing third; not severe enough to dull final image. Read-aloud rhythm mostly varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-universal-contraction amber deck as solitary shrine is fresh; coin-divination repurposed as cosmic archiving feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric-mythic mode commits fully without explanatory cheat. Tropes (lone oracle, prophecy) are re-animated through sensory specificity and scientific diction (“wavelength,” “static bursts”). Final map-image offers memorable visual reconfiguration.</comment>
