<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s emotional thaw is charted through tactile micro-choices (tracing the drum rim, pressing the needle into clay) that externalize her interiority without therapeutic self-labeling. The contradictory pull between nostalgic sound-memory and present silence is held in her body throughout, giving her final classroom poise credible cost. Kael’s quiet reciprocity supplies minimal but sufficient relational pressure. The only flattening is a slight over-reliance on “numbness” as a summary label in early beats; still, embodiment dominates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed phonograph re-weights silence from absence to fullness, with visible cost—Elara weeps, marks clay, forefeeds her prior isolation. Causal linkage is lean but intact: broken needle → backward spin → tactile vibration → emotional thaw → clay mark → restored teaching stance. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cavern, autumn leaves, Kael’s sawdust). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (muted soundscape) and deepened by each sensual layer until final image crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drum-maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: every tool, hide, and wood curl constrains Elara’s access to vibration and thus her choices. The broken needle’s glint and clay imprint act as tactile “places” that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys a deaf POV—vibration, rustle felt through soles, sight of seasons—never resorting to tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track across the single room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in line 2 and tightens when the needle’s backward vibration offers the only tactile bridge to feeling. One meaningful deepening: chaos of reversed beats resolves into “filament of hush,” foreclosing retreat into silence. Cost is visible: tears, clay mark, public re-entry as visibly altered teacher. Agency remains interior—listening by touch—but irrevocably alters her stance toward students and self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence not as void but as saturated canvas. The reversed phonograph re-prices the concept of “broken” into generative, a Conceptual Repricing felt in the final classroom image. No moral is stated; the clay impression of the snapped needle is the argument. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s sawdust nod, Elara’s barefoot vibration—never in commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains tight perceptual signature: rustle “felt more than heard,” drumskins “taut with anticipation,” phonograph horn “like a metallic flower.” Rhythm modulates from hushed sibilants to percussive monosyllables during vibration beat, mirroring Elara’s rising pulse. Filter verbs avoided; inference kept modest. Only one register lift—“emotional numbness” flagged as label—keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She traced the rim…its surface cool and waiting, like her own heart” fuses touch, simile, and interior state in one clause. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors; drum/needle imagery stays coherent. Variation in sentence length creates inhalation/exhalation rhythm matching listening scenes. Final line cadence—“always new, always alive”—earns its parallelism by echoing reversed motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Treating deafness not as loss but as alternate route to music is fresh, yet familiar; the reversal mechanic (playing recordings backward via snapped needle) supplies the non-obvious synthesis that makes the premise feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet—no twist, no antagonist—but emotional specificity rescues it from template. Clay mark of a broken tool as lifelong reminder is a small, memorable inflection.</comment>
