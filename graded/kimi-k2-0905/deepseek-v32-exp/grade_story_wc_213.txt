<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—ignoring the siren lever, trusting her data, pulling the bell—but interiority lapses into summary (“quiet satisfaction”) and the single, low-stakes decision keeps the cost theoretical rather than visceral. The character change is legible yet modest; the absence of any contradictory impulse on the page prevents the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell replaces the siren, villagers listen, storm met without panic—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (she now bears sole responsibility for silent warnings). Causal chain holds: data → bell pull → preparedness. Orientation anchored by 60 words. One micro-turn suffices; no reversals or rising price keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Windblown sanctuary above the clouds” is tactile—stone parapets, frayed rope, pressure drop—yet the environment never physically constrains or endangers Elara; it’s backdrop not crucible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting’s only causal role is acoustic (bell carries), so the 9+ gate on constraint isn’t met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent needless panic—signaled early; pressure rises via sensor data, not interpersonal conflict. Single meaningful tightening: she forsakes the siren for the bell, foreclosing the old protocol. Cost is communal (risk of non-compliance) rather than personal; no visible price paid by Elara on the page keeps escalation moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening > noise. Bell vs. siren reweights meaning without sermonizing. Final image (wind carries bell memory) offers quiet Conceptual Repricing. Avoids thesis statement; ambiguity remains—what if next storm is worse?—satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric, stable close distance; perceptual signature consistent—wind, hush, microclimate detail. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for quiet, staccato for sensor alert. No dialogue, no head-hop. Prose texture distinct: “solstice hush,” “zero hour” as refrain. No elision taught, so 9+ withheld.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences pull rather than push. High density—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor. Minor over-modifying (“profound quiet,” “gentle sound”) but peak beats stay clear. Copy clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—storm watcher swaps siren for cathedral bell—is fresh angle on disaster trope. Microclimate science feels specific; bell rope glue detail quirky yet believable. Transformation test: swap names and concept collapses. Risk is quiet, not gimmicky. Lacks deeper cultural or moral twist for 9-band.</comment>
