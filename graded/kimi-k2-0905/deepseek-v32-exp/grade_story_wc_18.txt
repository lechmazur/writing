<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elian’s obsession with the crystalline peaks is vivid, but his interiority toggles between poetic labels (“runaway dream”) and embodied urgency without contradiction being dramatized. Lyra stays calm accessory; no contradictory impulse or status pressure is granted to her. The micro-choice to breathe in sync is the only visible cost/anchor; the final mirror-holding reads as triumph, not renunciation, so the promised “earned stasis” feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror’s captured glass-mountain glow reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he can now access the dream only through a fragment. Causal chain holds: broken sextant → breathing ritual → mirror cage; no late rule changes. The Orientation Test is passed by ~70 words. Persistent constraint (mirror as sole portal) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog-bound orchard and mirrored light construct an accumulative texture that tightens around the breathing beat; twilight frost supplies both ticking clock and refracting surface. Mirrors act as micro-setting that literally bends choice—each angle decides how much dream is let in. Final mirror object charges the closing image by compressing the whole glass mountain range into a palm-sized shard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the dream before it vanishes”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via breathing-sync deepening that dissolves boundary between real and dream. Cost is conceptual: once bottled, the dream is no longer “runaway,” shrinking immensity to handheld reflection—felt but not viscerally painful. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversal, yet option set narrows to mirror-or-nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-erasure emerges through prismatic imagery rather than statement; final mirror re-prices the concept by showing containment=fragmentation. No moralizing line recites the thesis. Subtext lingers in the irony that to “own” the dream is to shrink it—an ambiguity not spelled out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice owns a glassy, reflective diction (“shimmer of twilight frost,” “diamond-like sparks”) consistent with mirror-maker POV. Syntax stays compact, almost breath-metered, echoing the sync ritual. No dialogue to test voice divergence; interior handle on Lyra is kept modestly external, avoiding POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><<comment>Prose carries high density—images layer without scaffold: “gnarled skeletons of apple trees” fuses sight + tactility. One mixed metaphor (“brittle bones” for trees) is minor. Rhythm modulates: shorter sentences under breath-sync beat accelerate pulse. No loops or filter-verb stacks; closing line cleanly re-circulates frost image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of broken sextant + breathwork + mirror array feels idiosyncratic; not a trope template. Conceptual turn—dream capture equals miniaturization—gives fresh bite to familiar “artist vs. vision” plot. Risk resides in low-conflict, cooperative climax, but coherence holds. Specificity of orchard-mirroring-light mechanic prevents easy relocation of story bones.</comment>
