<comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—mechanical arm vs. organic hand, diplomatic poise vs. duelist aggression—is dramatized in gesture and micro-choice (needle insertion, sword offer). The “diplomatically fierce” trait costs him visible tension when the scroll is proffered instead of a thrust. The rival remains a silhouette, so status dynamics are thin, but Kaelen’s hierarchy of values (truth > victory) is legible in the final disarm. Mechanical arm as lived prosthetic is handled with tactile specificity; no competence over-claim.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each needle → letter → groove → scroll → truce is a because/therefore chain that lands a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (rivalry foreclosed, new school born). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (glass atrium, brook, sundial pedestal). Closure is on-page: “We seek the same truth” spoken while blade is lowered; the brook’s path becomes their shared future. No amnesia or teleporting props; sundial compartment is seeded early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Glass atrium acts as pressure-cooker: prismatic shards skid across floor during parry, forcing footwork recalibration. Quiet brook outside mirrors the internal shift from erosion to collaboration. Half-painted sundial doubles as cipher machine and clock, its blank stone a looming absence that guides the final lunge. Micro-setting (needle card in pocket) constrains tactics—only 12 needles, so each angle choice is irreversible.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—decode before duel or lose philosophical destiny—is signaled by line 3. Escalation: each decoded angle narrows the possible terms of engagement until the scroll forces collaboration; the cost is the forfeiture of solo triumph. Agency sits with Kaelen: he chooses to insert the needle, to offer the scroll, to disarm with revelation rather than force. Price is paid on-page: rivalry dissolved, public identity as duelist redefined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the brook-image: truth is not conquest but erosion into shared channel. Subtext in silence—Kaelen’s mechanical arm retracts only after the rival’s blade lowers, showing trust earned. No moralizing final sentence; the sundial’s now-silent angles reweight the premise: time measured by joint inquiry, not solitary dominance. Ambiguity remains: will their new school survive court politics?—left open but charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains Kaelen’s perceptual signature—geometric metaphors, gear-twitch syntax, light refracted through glass. No head-hopping; rival’s thoughts remain opaque, read only through blade angle. Diction stays within philosopher-fencer register: “syllogism of steel,” “conceptual repricing,” yet never academic filler. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses during parry, then lengthens beside brook—intentional cadence shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety high; no template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors avoided—mechanical arm whirs like “scorpion’s tail” once, then discarded. Information density strong: one sentence can place needle, reveal hour-line, emit click, slide compartment. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“questions of yesterday now charting a course for tomorrow”) recharges brook-metaphor without cliché. Zero scaffold; paragraph cut test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fencing duel as live syllogistic debate, sundial as cipher, needle card as calipers—each trope transformed through tactile use. Risk of over-conceptualization is embraced but grounded in prosthetic arm’s materiality. Not a stitched prompt response; voice commits to philosopher-duelist hybrid throughout. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: rivalry → collaboration encoded in the same angles that once divided them.</comment>
