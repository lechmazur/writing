<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for external tech guidance vs. surrender to ancestral instruction—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (letting the slide steer her chisel, palms bleeding). The conclusive renunciation of the revived GPS shows visible cost and earns its place in the causal chain; her flaw (dependency on outside navigation) is accepted, not cured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: slide discovery therefore redirects carving method therefore crystallizes final sculpture; the lantern’s internal light going dark exactly as storm abates supplies the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Spatial anchors hit early (~70 words), no orientation debt; closure image (Elara drives away ignoring GPS) re-weights premise with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-arch’s turbine-like resonance and the salt-stiff slide function as micro-setting objects that literally steer tool angle and interior cadence; selective auditory detail (groaning stone, hum seeping into bones) mirrors Elara’s entrainment without tourist clutter. Irreplaceable environmental constraint: the arch’s drone paces her carving rhythm, charging the final polished spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"find way when external guidance fails"—is signaled by GPS blackout line 1; escalation proceeds because each projected ghost reveals a manual workaround that progressively strips Elara’s reliance on tech. The final cost (she will navigate by sculpture-memory, not satellites) is visible and persistent, fulfilling lens-specific agency requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete relay of manual artistry across centuries; no explicit moralizing. The "anchor-and-sail" sculpture offers resonant non-literal answer to crisis-of-direction question, embodying rooted flight without declarative thesis. Ambiguity lingers: technology isn’t evil, just optional—complexity accepted rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s sculptor perception—she reads wood grain like sea-writ text; no POV leakage. Prose rhythm modulates from storm-beat sentences to spiral, upward cadence mirroring carving flow; filter-verb density near zero. Distinct perceptual signature maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences splice sensory data, tool action, and conceptual leap ("she carved not just wood, but the essence of connection"). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language scarce in peak beat, maintaining clarity. Varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph cuts propel momentum without algorithmic feel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of driftwood sculptor + magic-lanern-slide ancestry + GPS-failure parable feels non-obvious; each component transforms familiar "artist lost in storm" premise. The turbine-hum as ancestral metronome is a fresh sensory device that logically feeds carving rhythm. Risk of concept overload is held off by concrete specificity and earned closure.</comment>
