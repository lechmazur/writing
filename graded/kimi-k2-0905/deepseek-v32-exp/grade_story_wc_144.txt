<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile synesthesia is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“felt its delicate frame and the faint vibrations of its dormant heart”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the micro-choice to release the drone is unopposed, so the arc is smooth rather than tested. Blind competence is total; no misreading of the refraction pattern jeopardizes the repair, flattening stakes. Earned cost is missing—success feels pre-assured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s successful flight reconfigures the depot’s atmosphere and Elara’s sense of connection. Causal chain is linear—storm corruption → refraction diagnosis → patch → test—but the anchor-lifting clock is ornamental; the patch is finished before the chain finishes rattling, so deadline pressure never constricts options. One soft reset: the “chaotic symphony” of feedback becomes “clear, decipherable data” instantly after a single software tweak, muting visible cost. Lens holds as Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mist, drip, and rail-yard echo stay filtered through Elara’s non-visual senses, anchoring orientation early. The water-bowl refractor is a tactile micro-setting that directly enables the climax; its cool surface and shifting heat gradients constrain her diagnostic moves. Depot geography stays stable; distance to the Aethel is tracked by receding anchor chain. Environment does not force a trade-off, so the 9+ gate is missed, but sensory specificity is strong throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore navigation drone before ship departs—is signaled early. Escalation is a single straight line: silence → hum → flight. No reversal or resource lost; the patch works on first try, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is off-loaded onto the ship’s future voyage, not Elara’s present options, keeping tension moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mending as seeing” emerges through the refraction method rather than exposition. Final image—harmony felt in air pressure and distant hum—reweights the opening silence without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit: the drone’s restored sight mirrors Elara’s inner vision, yet the parallel is allowed, not asserted. Ambiguity is modest but present; no tidy maxim caps the tale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings tightly to Elara’s tactile earscape; diction stays within artisanal lexicon (“oil and metal,” “circuits gentle as a lover’s caress”). Rhythm lengthens during repair, then shortens at release, mirroring heartbeat-like wing flutter. No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contaminated. Occasional elevated phrasing (“magnetic calm”) edges toward lyric but stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is good; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is restrained—three metaphors across 700 words—so density never clots. One paraphrase loop: “decode the feedback… into direction” appears twice in adjacent sentences. Otherwise propulsion is clean, with strong tactile verbs (“traced,” “released,” “soared”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Blind engineer who “sees” via water-refraction thermography is a fresh sensory inversion; not a retread of Daredevil echolocation. The hummingbird drone as synesthetic diagnostic object feels specific to this world. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric SF rather than twist-driven—but coherence is high. Could push further if the repair method carried a visible price or flaw.</comment>
