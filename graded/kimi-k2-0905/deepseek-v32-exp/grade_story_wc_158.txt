<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, specific to the “insomniac poet”: his trembling hand, pearlescent eye-tracks, the act of ensconcing. Contradictory impulses (shy vs. unstoppable) are asserted but not dramatized in a single visible beat; they stay parallel rather than colliding under pressure. The centuries-long endurance earns a final renunciation (“last pain into beauty”) with conceptual cost, satisfying the closure gate. Voice remains coherent but leans on lyrical assertion over bodily micro-choice in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: repetitions of “half-sung lullabies / off-key wind” tighten pattern until the echo returns, landing a Charged Poise closure—the shell hums with “returned peace.” Orientation delivered lyrically but legibly within 120 words: who (poet), where (gargantuan shell), when (centuries of night). No causal reversals, yet the cadence shift from solitary song to answered chorus is a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is felt: centuries of insomnia crystallize into one final lullaby, foreclosing further pursuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shell interior as micro-setting constrains every move—echoes pool, wind sighs through fissures, starlight reflection charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory/visceral over visual catalog, matching insomnia’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent: retreat deeper into niche → echo return → shell hums. Kelp-parchment, postcard tattoo, reef-shadow light are tactile, lived-in details that evolved with action; shell’s resonant cavity literally amplifies the lullabies, feeding climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake early: turn private anguish into verses that reach the world. Escalation is accretive—each night’s lullaby adds a layer until the wind returns them as distant songs; no tightening reverses choice, but the deepening reweights the poet’s isolation into communal impact. Visible cost: centuries of sleeplessness, final renunciation of further poems. Agency resides in persistence, not overt decision, fitting lyric mode; still, one micro-turn (echo returns) is passive wind, not protagonist-driven, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated image: blossom armistice as cosmic/earthly ceasefire flowering from discordant song. Subtext operates through silence—no reader-addressed moral, only the returned lullabies as proof. Final image of postcard fused to palm reweights prior longing as bodily inscription, a CR that conceptually reprices art’s cost. Avoids explicit thesis; “reef-shadow joy” stays metaphorical, resonant, untidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric persona sustains hypnotic, compressed diction—“pearlescent arches,” “reef-shadow joy”—within poet’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm parallels insomnia: long anaphoric loops (“his motivation…his verses…his lullabies”) mimic obsessive return. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal voice distinct, consistent. Patterned elision (“centuries of longing” without exposition) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High figurative density risks purple fatigue, but pattern is taught and accrual is purposeful; only isolated mixed metaphor (“reef-shadow joy filtered through memory”) mildly jars. No loops or synonym churn; each recurrence of “half-sung lullabies” adds semantic layer. Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph length modulates to mirror hush-crescendo. Closure line clean, propulsive, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blossom armistice as floral ceasefire is a fresh conceptual synthesis; linking cosmic truce to off-key lullabies feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Insomniac poet inside resonant seashell is idiosyncratic image that grounds abstraction. Risky lyric accumulative structure commits fully; coherence maintained. Could not swap shell for cave or postcard for letter without breaking sonic amplification and marine metaphor web.</comment>
