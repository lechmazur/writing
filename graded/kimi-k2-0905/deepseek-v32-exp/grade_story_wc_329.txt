<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is declared repeatedly but never sharpened into a personal wound or memory; interiority stays generic (“she felt despair,” “her own heart light”). The locust shell is clutched twice yet never alters her tactical thinking on the page—she was already planning the heartbeat gambit—so the object doesn’t test or reveal character. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; once she decides, execution is frictionless, so the final “peace” feels unearned rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: locust shell → heartbeat idea → crystal dies. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (statues uproot, crystal light dies), satisfying the lens. However, the heartbeat method is recalled rather than discovered in-scene, so the pivotal tactic arrives via exposition, not pressure. Orientation is fine; no caps triggered.</comment>

<comment>Sky-bridge, crystalline arches, and stone patrol paths are sketched with economy; spatial choreography remains coherent as Elara descends. The “tarnished fruit” image usefully mirrors the mechanical blight, charging the final brightening. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual), but selection fits the POV’s urgency. Micro-setting (locust shell in railing) constrains her attention and seeds the plan, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore beauty—is signaled early. Escalation is linear: statues track → Warden confrontation → heartbeat gambit → crystal dies. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Warden’s surface quivers, proving the method works and raising the final physical risk. Cost is present (crystal extinguished, statues shed servitude), but because Elara faces no counter-move or personal loss, pressure feels moderate, not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of art vs. mechanism emerges through action rather than lecture. The heartbeat-as-signal reweights the locust shell from empty husk to generative symbol, supplying a quiet conceptual repricing. Final image of stone guardians bowing offers non-literal resonance. However, the story never complicates the equation—no cost to Elara, no suggestion that beauty might also wound—so complexity stalls at the threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “resonantly soft” repeats as a musical signature without grating. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—long sentences during descent, clipped fragments at the crack of light. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent. Register never drifts into abstraction; diction stays within a bardic cadence appropriate to fable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and functional (“arches spanning… like frozen music”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or tactic. Occasional adjectival stacking (“tarnished wonder,” “nascent hope”) flirts with template cadence but never clots the beat. Closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing violin heartbeat with locust metamorphosis gives the piece a fresh pulse; the living-statue orchard is familiar fantasy, but the acoustic hacking angle feels novel. Risk is moderate—no structural acrobatics—but the concept commits fully. The story could take place in any enchanted grove with minor reskin, so specificity is not absolute, yet the sonic mechanics lift it above template.</comment>
