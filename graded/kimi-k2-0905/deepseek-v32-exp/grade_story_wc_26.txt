<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive to “preserve the shape of hope” is cleanly dramatized through the video-comparison ritual and her final decision to transform the shadow; interiority stays concrete (“the stone cool against her palm”). The decisive beat costs her the raw truth of human pain, a credible renunciation. Yet her status as “dusk noticer” remains more label than lived occupation—no micro-choice shows how sharp-eyed skill alters tactics. Secondary pressure is absent; the library itself never pushes back. Still, the earned stasis lands with felt price, satisfying the 9− gate.

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain: discovery of shadow → decision to metamorphose → successful transformation at the cost of emotional truth. Orientation is clean by line 6; one soft transition (archive room → console) is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: hope is saved yet “less true,” a conceptual repricing charged by the final image of stars outside the silent library. The lens holds without ambiguity; only minor slack is the off-stage origin of the stone’s power.

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “blooming library above clouds” is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“crystalline shelves,” petals of light unfolding—never stalling momentum. The river stone functions as micro-setting, grounding the aerial world in tactile weight; its final clutch recharges the regret. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not actively constrain tactics, so 9+ gate fails.

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hope’s integrity—tightens once: the shadow’s spread vs. Elara’s counter-ritual. Escalation is causal: each clip comparison raises urgency until the metamorphose becomes inevitable. The price—loss of raw pain—lands on-page in the final paragraph. No second reversal, but one meaningful turn suffices; coincidence never intrudes.

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: shared dreams purified at the cost of truth. The violet-gold transformation reweights earlier color imagery, achieving conceptual repricing. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; the question “can it still be called hope?” stays implicit. Subtext in the stone’s solidity vs. mutable dreams deepens resonance.

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elara’s perceptual filter—“softly deliberate grace,” “luminous regret.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; rhythm mirrors the hush of dusk observance. Minor template cadence in “the library bloomed… petals of light unfolding” is acceptable under lyric pressure.

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“petals of light,” “shadow unbound”) stay coherent and purposeful. Information density high: one line often advances mood, world-rule, and stake simultaneously. Only faint purple tinge in “beautiful, sorrowful light” keeps it sub-9.

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Shared-dream library” reframes cyber-angel trope into quiet lyric science-fantasy; the video-archive method feels novel yet intuitive. The shadow as crystallized regret is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to make victory feel like loss pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of the river stone prevents generic swap.
