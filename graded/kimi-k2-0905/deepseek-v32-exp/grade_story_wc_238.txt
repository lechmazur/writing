<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her belief in “imperfect miracles” surfaces through micro-choices (placing the bottle, switching the device) and her gritty interior voice (“Hauntings are like stuck records”). The moment she feels the archive’s atmosphere soften carries embodied cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly under-ripened, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single apple blossom landing on the sonata page reweights the premise, the word “forgiven” visible as conceptual cost. Causal chain—perfume bottle → induced current → apology → blossom—holds without gaps. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift from minor-key hum to lullaby satisfies. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive’s “bowing shelves” and “scent of aged paper” constrain Elara’s movements and tool placement; the orchard outside acts as a live clock pressuring closure. The orange-blossom perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional eye—selective, tactile, never touristy. Spatial choreography holds as the blossom drifts through a closed window without logic breach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the apology before trees fall—tightens when chainsaw growl begins at dawn. The apology itself is the irrevocable act that forecloses Alistair’s haunting; cost is felt in Elara’s exhausted “gritty” breath and the orchard’s impending loss. Agency remains hers: she alone triggers the current, uncorks the bottle, accepts the imperfect result. No reversal, but deepening meets the 800-word bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: imperfect repair is still worth pursuing. Subtext resides in the blossom’s dew-script “forgiven”—a non-literal answer to “can gossip’s damage be undone?” The orchard’s scheduled erasure outside the stained-glass window reweights the miracle’s limits. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the lullaby-softened archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual signature—“paper ghosts,” “faint hum in minor keys”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (short clauses when current buzzes). No POV slippage; diction stays within her lexicon. Filter verbs are sparse; metaphors are hers, not authorial overlay. Final sentence cadence mirrors exit footfalls—quiet, gritty, earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “the air seemed to shimmer with invisible forces” does double duty—setting and device effect. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; orange-blossom scent returns with reweighted meaning. Sentence variety supports the lullaby close. One near-repeat—“the hush… deepened, a respectful silence”—but it serves ritual cadence, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>The gossip-column exorcist angle is fresh, fused with low-fi EMF fringe-science and orchard extinction clock. Transformation test fails if Elara were merely “medium”; her professional gadget and metaphoric needle-nudge make the concept singular. Risk in lyric blossom payoff is high yet lands. No recognizable template echo; specific detail (cut-glass bottle, minor-key hum) anchors originality.</comment>
