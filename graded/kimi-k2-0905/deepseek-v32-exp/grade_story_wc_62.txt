<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—carver of permanence chasing impermanent grief—anchors every beat; her fierce meditation visibly costs sweat and delayed blinks, not told labels. The ancestral poem-trades erupt as whispered, half-remembered lines under broken glass, bodying her value hierarchy without exposition. Yet the grandfather ghost acts as external conscience, softening the blind-spot tension that should compound mistakes; she never misreads a ribbon or misroutes a butterfly, so growth feels gently serendipitous rather than wrested. Closure still lands: she accepts grief’s fluidity, rolls the ribbons, foregoes stone-fixity—Earned Stasis visible in soot-smudged palms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared early and held: ribbon-strand ↔ butterfly-path ↔ grief-path, each repetition thickening pattern until meaning tilts. Orientation crisp inside 60 words (greenhouse dusk, cracked ivy, carver quest). Escalation is density, not causality: each matched ribbon/butterfly pair adds semantic weight until the weave itself becomes a map she cannot carve in granite. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: final recital charges the prior pattern with new value—grief as connective loom—cost felt in relinquishing “stone forever” stance; grandfather dissolves, constraint accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, fern-wet air, monarch blur, and stone-dust skin all filter through Elara’s tactile attention; ivy fractures guide her finger-trace, bench rot decides sitting height, butterfly draft dictates whisper-timing. Ribbon colors (faded indigo, blood-rust ochre) constrain which memory-poem she murmurs, binding environment to tactic. Final recital occurs amid last swirl of monarchs—setting actively charges the closure image, passing 9+ gate. Minor slip: spatial sweep from rafters to potting table on second entrance is rushed, but never confuses later moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find grief’s shape—signaled in line 1; pressure is epistemic, not peril. Tightening happens each time she pairs ribbon to butterfly route, narrowing interpretive options until only connectivity model survives; cost is relinquishing the “monolith” comfort of headstones. No external antagonist or resource loss, so escalation is quiet and cerebral; this caps intensity below 8-band. Still, accrued density forces a stance crystallization that feels final and irrevocable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: weave = migration = communal sorrow, all refusing singular endpoints. Subtext lives in gesture—ghost pointing, leaf-breeze “response”—never named mentorship. Final ribbon roll-up reweights stone as one thread among many, offering resonant non-verbal answer; avoids tidy moral. One soft echo of prompt-language “shape of collective grief” leaks into late exposition (−0.2), but rest remains particular and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s sensory hierarchy: chisel-calloused fingers, dust-spiced air, poem fragments half-remembered; diction stays within a limber artisan lexicon. Rhythm lengthens during meditative matches, shortens when monarchs swirl, mirroring attention. Ghost’s leaf-breeze “dialogue” is indirection done right—no italicized phantom monologue. Filter verbs minimal and motivated (“she felt the weave yield”). Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience; closure image stays filtered through her soot-smudged palms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Syntactic variety supports thundering calm: long anaphoric cadence for migration swarms, then curt recitative for poem snippets. Information density high—one line can layer glass crack sound, ribbon hue, and memory name. Figurative control consistent (migration as ink, ribbons as roots) without mixed metaphors. Minor micro-scaffold: “she retraced… she retraced” stem appears twice; paraphrase loop but does not touch closure. Opening line grabs voice and quest; final line image resolves pattern cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing gravestone craft with butterfly ephemeris is fresh synthesis; ribbon-as-map turns funeral inventory into living cartography. Ancestral poem-swap custom is not mere folklore—it drives on-page recitals that climax in transformation. Risk of quiet lyric grief-essay is taken and earned: no villain, no death-twist, yet coherent pressure holds. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, satisfying originality gate. Small quarter-point bonus for risking accretive lyric over causal plot.</comment>
