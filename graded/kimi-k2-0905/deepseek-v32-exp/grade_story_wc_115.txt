<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s skeptical, rust-trusting worldview is consistently embodied; the moment he fingers the beaded wheel we feel his forensic itch. His drowsy-alert state is shown through narrowed sensory filters rather than labels. The final gesture—replacing the valve—caps his arc with visible cost: he now carries the history he once mocked. Interior contradiction could be sharper during the radio confession beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: because he decodes the caller’s confession he recognises the valve, therefore he can silence the ghost-shift. Closure is a Decisive Change—phantom machines stop, tunnel pressure lifts, cost is the weight he now shoulders. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens drift. One minor ellipsis: the radio’s sudden crystal-clear reception inside a steel tunnel is unexplained, but it does not break the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Tunnel’s crumbling bricks, silt under boot, and brass wheel glint are selective, tactile, and filtered through Kaelen’s ruin-lust. Cold air and metallic clank escalate threat without catalogue. The beaded wheel reappears as the charged final image, constraining his choice to restore it. Spatial track is flawless; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the swallowed truth—tightens when the radio confession makes the abstract disaster personal. One meaningful reversal: ghost-shift sounds cease the instant guilt is spoken, proving trauma not specter. Cost is rendered on-page: “the tunnel did not feel so heavy anymore,” transferring weight to Kaelen. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: collective guilt can machine-groove reality until acknowledgement lifts it. Subtext lives in the beaded wheel—beauty fused to failure—and in the psychic callers’ metaphors. Final image reframes earlier “pathetic folklore” as human circuitry. No moralising; resonance is felt through weight transfer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual bias—rust > spirits—and diction stays industrial (“forensic itch,” “factory ghost shift”). Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as clanking grows. No head-hop; radio voices are surface only. One register slip: “profound hush” sounds authorial, not Kaelen’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “his headlamp cutting a frail beam through the absolute dark” anchors space and mood. No scaffold loops; metaphors are sparse and mechanical, matching POV. Strong verbs (“crunching,” “glinted”) carry motion. One paraphrase echo: “weight of a swallowed truth” appears twice—minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ghost-shift as auditory trauma-print rather than literal haunt is fresh, yet grows organically from rust-belt ruins and talk-radio desperation. Beaded valve—tool turned objet d’art—re-images industrial decay. Risk: using psychic hotline as forensic device could feel gimmicky, but here it externalises buried confession. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
