<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“jaws… shaking me like a rag doll,” “a hot spike of jealousy”), but the only micro-choice—scratching symbols onto bark—arrives late and changes nothing; no path is foreclosed, so the cost feels intellectual rather than lived. The jealousy motive is stated repeatedly yet never alters tactics mid-scene; the scroll act is cathartic, not causal. Earned stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lyric-accumulative lens is taught early and holds: each shard adds density to the same stake—how to live after seeing one’s grave—until the final image of the filled scroll reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grave remains, but narrative ownership of it shifts; cost is felt in the ache of the writing hand and the “quiet horror” now framed as story. Orientation anchors cleanly inside 120 words; transitions are signaled by dream logic rather than ellipsis, satisfying Track B mosaic rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cabin, body, and scroll function as micro-setting: the scroll’s pulsing light constrains the final act of inscription, turning artifact into altar. Selective sensory detail (charred stick, bruised sky) mirrors internal erosion without cataloguing. Spatial coherence is maintained across dream shards by returning to the table; environment never overwhelms the single-scene window. The grave-clearing itself is implied, not staged, so the setting’s fullest constraint is conceptual rather than tactile—enough to meet the 9+ gate but not exceed it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to endure foreknowledge of death—tightens through recursive aerial overview: each loop reveals another innocent past self, deepening the cost of knowledge. The single meaningful turn is the decision to write/draw rather than flee; it narrows options from infinite dream flight to one bark rectangle. Cost is legible as exhaustion and “aching hand,” yet the escalation is accretive, not decisive; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Still, under an accumulative lens, the densification of dread suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the impossibility of linear selfhood when chronology collapses. No character states a thesis; insight is embedded in the overlapping circles scratched onto bark. The final image reframes the grave from looming doom to owned artifact—Conceptual Repricing with quiet social cost: the ranger’s public record is now a private talisman. Ambiguity lingers—will inscription ward off fate or merely prefigure it—yielding honest complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is knife-sharp: “stupid, unearned confidence,” “awe carved hollow.” Syntax fragments under dream stress (“This was the jaded wonder…”), then re-lengthens in the cabin, mirroring grounded exhaustion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained via dental metaphors for mountains and card-deck chaos for memory. Register stays within ranger-poet lexicon; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent (mountains as broken teeth, nostalgia as feral predator); no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “I was… I was…” anaphora in dream shard is purposeful, taught early, and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“chaos… chaos”) but it occurs in low-pressure exposition; closure image remains uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicle with elegiac ranger solitude feels fresh; trope of seeing one’s grave is reweighted through non-linear self-envy rather than horror. Risky structural choice—mosaic dream shards—heightens disorientation yet lands cleanly. Specificity of birch scroll as writing surface rescues the piece from generic “journal” trope. Could edge higher if the envy mechanism were less declared and more enacted.</comment>
