<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s “gently meticulous” trait is lived-in: every handling of the lantern slide, every dial-turn is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—frost seeping into bones, the ache in his chest—never sliding into diagnostic speak. The arc is credible endurance: he cannot save the vows, only honor them, and that renunciation carries visible cost in the dimming slide and the library’s final sigh. One-step short of exceptional because no contradictory impulse is allowed to test him in scene; his stance is set from the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sampled frequency adds density until the final cadence shift—”meaning endured, etched into the records”—reweights the stake from rescue to witness. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the library’s sigh and the stored slide crystallize options ( preservation chosen over intervention) with felt cost. Causality is internal and steady; no external antagonist is needed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop but instrument: cold slows movement, dictates silent steps, and finally admits a “permanent, peaceful silence” that charges the ending. Micro-setting objects—the brass projector, the ice-crusted spines—constrain every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: dying light and crackling ice mirror internal fading. One hairline slip: “above the clouds” is stated once and never exploited atmospherically, keeping it from perfect integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save meaning from oblivion—tightens through each sampled vow; every measurement forecloses another fragment of hope. Escalation is accumulative: density of fading images reweights cost until the final dimming forces the shift to witness. Agency is pure attention; renunciation of rescue is the visible price. No external antagonist required; pressure is existential and coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the ethics of archival witness versus intervention. The queen’s vow reprise supplies the quiet thematic answer—some loves outlast their medium. No moralizing line mars the ending; the final image of etched records is the non-literal thesis. Minor deduction for abstract noun “meaning” appearing twice in close proximity; still, resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: selective attention to frost, light oscillations, joint ache. Syntax mirrors methodical care—long sentences for calibration, fragment-like beats for dimming flashes. No dialogue to distort voice. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” zone—but internal diction stays within a scholar’s range, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: measured clauses during sampling, staccato noun phrases at each fade. No loops or synonym churn; “gently meticulous” is repeated twice but serves as mantra, not artifact. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent (light = memory, ice = silence). One mixed metaphor—“quartz hush”/“crystalline stillness”—but it is taught early and paid off, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—librarian sampling dying star–mortals vows—feels fresh, not checklist fantasy. Archival magic reframes familiar “fading magic” trope into elegiac science. Specificity of frequency sampling and quartz hush prevents generic overlay. Risk is moderate; no structural gamble, but conceptual commitment is total.</comment>
