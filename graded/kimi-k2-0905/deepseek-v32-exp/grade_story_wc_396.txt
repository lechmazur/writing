<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s calm intuition is shown through gliding travel and silent concentration, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“failed to prevent”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The final empathy act is credible because the orb vision supplies motive, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a competing impulse; the decision feels single-track. Earned cost is present—the shard cuts his palm, the orb’s warmth marks him—but the story summarizes the internal shift instead of letting us watch him weigh release-versus-risk in a charged beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: cracking ice → shard quest → mirror visions → restored orb → leviathan freed; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the orb hovers, ice stills, and Kaelen’s altered stance (“insight into salvation”) is legible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (orchard→Driftwood) and it’s signaled. No lens ambiguity; causal drive is maintained to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver-barked trees, salt-weathered boards, and the tarnished mirror frame are selective, tactile, and filtered through Kaelen’s quiet attention. The lighthouse beam failing against mist shows world-rule change without exposition. Micro-setting works: the leather pouch, the cutting crystal edge, and the orb’s pulse constrain handling choices. Final image—orb-light bathing the cliffs—recharges the opening visual of failed beam, earning high-band specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save villages by stilling ice) is signaled early; pressure escalates as ice “groans like a living beast” and mirrors foreshadow the leviathan’s pain. One meaningful tightening: the revelation that destruction is collateral to a trapped creature collapses destroy-versus-save options, forcing empathy. Cost is visible—Kaelen’s shadow-laced pact, shard wound, and the silent store-owner’s weight—but the beat where he decides to free rather than kill is summarized, not dramatized, keeping it just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through mirrored wholeness and the refusal to destroy the leviathan; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext resides in the store-owner’s sea-glass silence and the shard’s cutting edge—pain as prerequisite for clarity. Final image reweights earlier “failure to prevent” into present agency. Ambiguity lingers: will the orb now demand further price? Yet the thematic arc is thin because Kaelen’s internal resistance is never textured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kaelen’s calm perception; diction (“shadow-laced,” “time pooled thin”) feels intrinsic to his mythic worldview. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for glide, fragments for mirror glimpses. No head-hopping; store-owner’s dialogue is spare, creating indirection. Voice achieves distinct texture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or causality. Only minor loop: “shadow-laced” appears three times in first 150 words without new inflection. Metaphors stay coherent (ice groans, mirrors pool time). No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“soft light”) without loss, but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing eco-fantasy with vintage-mirror time-pool is fresh; the leviathan-as-symptom reframes standard monster trope into climate-empathy parable. Specificity of “lighthouse orchard” and “orb of tranquil sight” prevents generic feel. Risk is moderate—quiet hero, no battle—but coherence justifies it. Not groundbreaking, yet synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
