<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s devotion and tactile ritual are vivid, but interiority stays safely single-note; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her resolve, so the arc is flat. The “withered” body is shown only in opening label; hands prune, but pain, fatigue, or doubt never complicate action. Because she never risks failure or must choose between garden and self, the final proof feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the skeptics’ flickering luck-meters reprice the world’s premise in favor of unmeasurable care—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polished marble adds density until the final display crystallizes meaning. One soft patch: the maze “breathing” is repeated without tactile cue, slightly dulling the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden is rendered through selective sensory cues—vine sap on fingers, hedge walls parting just enough—so setting acts as responsive character rather than backdrop. Marble cracks map labor history onto space, turning micro-object into lived geography. Weather and spatial scale remain absent, but at this length the pruned vine and clearing suffice to ground every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stake—prove care beats luck—is declared early and restated often, yet no scene tests failure; vines comply, visitors capitulate, so pressure plateaus. The single “stubborn vine” is redirected off-page before we see stakes. Because garden never resists, escalation is rhetorical, not tactical; cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via accretion: cracked marbles reframed as luminous proof that tending transcends quantification. Final image of flickering devices elegantly reweights the measurable-luck premise without sermon. Avoids explicit thesis until last paragraph’s “truth rooted in love,” a hairline slip toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s tactile diction—“gnarled,” “sap,” “gleam”—and rhythmic polishing refrain creates incantatory texture. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through her vine-wise attention. Occasional elevated abstract nouns (“conceptual repricing,” “moral calculus”) intrude in otherwise earthy lexicon, a minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from short horticultural commands to longer rolling clauses that mimic vine growth. Figurative control high: “blooming withering” oxymoron sustains without overwriting. Two paraphrase loops—“gardens know their gardeners” / “garden knew its gardener”—and one synonym pair (“elaborately” twice in four lines) slightly stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Quantified-luck society cracked-marble counter-archive feels fresh, synthesizing cli-fi metric-dystopia with pastoral devotion. Risk lies in quiet climax—no vine revolt, just belief affirmed—yet specificity of tactile ritual rescues it from allegory. Could swap names, but the marble-garden interface is idiosyncratic enough to linger.</comment>
