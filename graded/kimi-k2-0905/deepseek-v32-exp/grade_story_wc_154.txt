<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—coral weight, anesthetic haze, Kaito’s cast—yet the “shrewdly innocent” paradox is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice visibly risks her innocence or shrewdness, so the final catharsis feels lightly earned rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each decrypted symbol adds density until the two-holding-hands image reweights trauma into connection; the coral’s remembered warmth supplies felt cost, satisfying closure with no causal gaps or orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist, bruised skylight, and coral fragment create a coherent micro-setting that constrains perception—vapor softens edges, twilight limits vision—while the humidifier hiss mirrors anesthetic diffusion; setting is not mere backdrop but filters every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate terror into shared meaning—tightens as each smudged symbol is decoded; the final “two figures holding hands” forecloses the option of permanent incomprehension, with the coral’s pulse as visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through decryption metaphor: understanding as ceasefire. No moralizing; the reweighted coral and final hand-holding image let the reader feel that translation itself is a form of rebuilding—quiet, non-triumphal, but vital.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“lotus-hearted ache,” “syntax for healing”) is lyrical yet anchored in anesthetic fog and coral grit. No head-hop or register drift; rhythm swells and subsides with drugged breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies, figurative layering is purposeful; no synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“twilight space where the glass ceiling held the evening's bruised purple light”) risks purple but stays tethered to POV’s softened perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing war-zone translation with anesthetic dream-decryption feels fresh; coral as memory-storage object re-energizes a familiar trauma-healing arc. Risk is present—lyric disorientation could have capsized—but pattern holds, yielding specific rather than generic resonance.</comment>
