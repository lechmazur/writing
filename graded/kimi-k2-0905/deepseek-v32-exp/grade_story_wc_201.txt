<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and body-specific (“every fiber…screamed with the precise coordinates of its own suffering”), but the epiphany—“mercy was the interruption of a cycle”—is announced rather than dramatized with a visible cost. The strap-find supplies a data point, yet Kaelen’s shift to certainty feels abrupt; the prior beats show retreat into math, not an enacted test of mercy. Still, his flinch-to-calculation pattern is coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s reappearance reweights “ultraviolet penance” from pure suffering to system-break. Causal lens holds: each brace command triggers memory-loop, culminating in the insight that mercy is external to the pain algorithm. Orientation is swift; the grove anchors by sentence three. Cost is felt—“the strap still in his hand”—but the shift from panic to certainty could show more friction on the page.</comment>

<comment>The forest is not backdrop; its violet burn narrows perception, forces the mask memory, and supplies the strap artifact that reconfigures meaning. Glass bark, black water, and UV glare are filtered through Kaelen’s enhanced proprioception, constraining every step. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. The setting’s micro-shifts mirror his internal calibration, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the mathematics of mercy”—is signaled early and tightened by each proprioceptive spike. Escalation is accumulative: each snap/twig → strap memory tightens the loop until the found strap breaks it. Agency resides in attention: he chooses to reinterpret, not flee. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the insight forecloses the old equation but doesn’t dramatize a new action, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: mercy as algorithmic interruption is earned through iterated pain-data. The strap’s return re-prices prior suffering from meaningless to system-external. Subtext lives in gesture—hand to phantom buckle—rather than exposition. Final image resists moral; it crystallizes a stance, not a verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: math diction fused with corporeal precision—“proprioceptive feedback loop of weight and resistance.” Rhythm tightens under stress: short noun clusters mimic sensory overload. No head-hopping; distance stays tight. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds. Voice modulates from clinical to haunted without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—“grove of towering, glass-barked trees” anchors tone without purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density. Opening and final lines are economical and propulsive. Minor slip: “the mathematics of mercy consumed him” edges toward label-speak, but context keeps it tolerable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: torture aftermath reimagined as Bayesian quest in a UV forest. Proprioceptive enhancement as post-traumatic sense amplification feels non-obvious. The strap’s reappearance flips punishment into data, satisfying transformation test. Risk is moderate; concept drives stakes more than character choice, but execution is coherent.</comment>
