<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s exile-grief and chess-trained precision weave cleanly through every beat; the worry-stone gesture embodies rather than labels his anxiety. The final micro-choice—pressing the dent into the lodestone ridge—crystallizes his values with visible cost (the energy surge that “flooded” him). Interior contradiction is muted: he never seriously contemplates abandoning the quest, so the arc is more solemn execution than crucible. Still, the earned stillness of the closing image satisfies the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant “breathes again” and Kael’s hope is re-priced, the cost registered in the physical jolt he endures. Causal chain holds: basalt gift → remembered pact → nexus correlation → ritual fit → partial restoration. Orientation is taught early (who/where/when by line 3). One minor scuff: the text never risks showing a failed correlation, so the turn feels mildly predetermined rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nexus is not postcard backdrop; its magnetic pull literally guides the pivotal gesture, while twilight’s shift to indigo tracks tightening time. Basalt stone operates as micro-setting, its dent locking into the lodestone ridge to enable the climax. Sensory layering is selective—hum, pulse, bent light—filtered through Kael’s strategic attention. No environmental detail is squandered, though air/humidity/temperature could have sharpened one more beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore or accept the death of the eclipsed covenant—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens via the celestial “next phase” clock. Agency manifests in the deliberate stone-press that re-energizes the pact; the price is the visceral energy surge that leaves him momentarily overwhelmed. One meaningful escalation beat suffices under Accumulative lens. Pressure would feel sharper if the text had staged even a faint external obstacle or dissenting voice at the nexus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—“beauty discovered in the difficult”—emerges through the basalt ritual rather than authorial assertion; the dented stone’s flaw becomes the very key that rekindles harmony. Subtext of silenced Indigenous wisdom (Stone-Speakers) lingers without moralistic sermon. Final image reweights earlier metaphors (chess silence = untapped alliance) into a non-literal answer. A half-point dock for the penultimate paragraph’s slightly propositional phrasing of “beauty he sought lay in this chance to mend.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s calculative yet wounded perceptual filter; syntax is precise but not mechanical, echoing chess logic (“correlate,”“translate silence”). No head-hop; psychic distance compresses credibly under energy surge. Free-indirect touches (“time was short”) maintain immediacy. Voice could push further into idiosyncratic diction, but within 700 words the texture is distinct and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during surge. Figurative language is sparse and organic (“light seem to bend”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—the phrase “correlate the scattered signs and portents” repeats conceptually soon after—barely dulls momentum. Otherwise information density is high and sentences pull double duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing geomancy, chess silence, and basalt lithomancy yields a fresh composite; the worry-stone-as-key twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet not obvious at setup. Risk is moderate—lyric stillness over action—but coherent to stakes. A stronger shock of particularity (e.g., one localized geological anomaly) could have nudged it into the 9-band. Still, the synthesis avoids both generic fantasy templates and quirky-for-its-own-sake ornamentation.</comment>
