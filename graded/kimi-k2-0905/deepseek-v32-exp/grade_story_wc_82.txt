<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-propelled origami drive is vivid and embodied; her interiority stays concrete through tactile paper folding and gem-rubbing. The detached-sentient-shadow is a bold flaw that compounds her ache, yet its pure-melancholy voice is declared not dramatized, so the “mistake” never pressures her on-page choices. Final crane-fleet reunion supplies visible cost and earned endurance, but the shadow’s re-merge is more symbolic than causal within her decision path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of “polish-fold-ache” tightens through image density rather than causal reversals; closure lands as Charged Poise when the glowing cranes lift and the shadow re-attaches, re-weighting grief into luminescent memory. Orientation clear by word 50; only one transition (garden→basilica). Cost is felt in the final “fleet of luminous cranes” image, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but escalation is gentle (density only) and the decisive beat is communal image rather than personal trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating island, perfumed tea soil, twin suns, crystalline basilica—each detail is filtered through Elara’s lantern-maker eye and constrains her ritual path. Micro-setting of gem and paper cranes serve as tactile “rooms” that must be handled to progress. Spatial choreography is flawless; no static expo dumps. The basilica’s refracted rainbow light returns in the final image, recharging the luminous torment motif and satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transmute grief into 1 000 cranes; pressure escalates by accretion of polished gems → folded birds → growing flock. Agency is continuous craft action; no external antagonist. One meaningful tightening: the 1000th crane triggers shadow reunion, a conceptual repricing rather than option foreclosure. Cost is emotional—each crane absorbs “a fragment of her pain”—but no live resource loss alters tactics; intensity rises through imagery repetition, not narrowing choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief refined into fragile art gains lift. Subtext lives in mirrored motions—Elara rubs gems, shadow mimics polishing—showing sorrow’s un-severable echo. Final image of paper wings taking flight re-weights earlier “luminous torment” into tender after-glow, avoiding moralizing. No thesis statements; meaning accumulates through sensory pattern rather than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice saturated with lantern-maker perception: “glass basilica gleamed under twin suns,” “gem surface swirling with captured nightmares.” Rhythm flexes—long breathy clauses for ritual, staccato “fold, polish, fold” under mounting ache. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within artisan lexicon. Non-standard plural “descends while ascending” taught early and paid off each stair-climb, a patterned elision that charges the lyric arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sense, tool, and emotion: “She rubbed the gem with a soft cloth, its surface swirling with captured nightmares and joys.” No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent to light/refraction motif. One mixed image—“hollow ache that nothing could fill”—is minor. Final paragraph cadence slows to match release, ear-test excellent. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentient detached shadow as grief-double is fresh; gem-polishing dreams into origami cranes synthesizes Japanese legend with fantasy craft. Dream-orbs inside a glass basilica on a floating tea-island is baroque yet internally consistent. Risk of over-ornament is high, but specificity of artisan process keeps it grounded. Transformation test passes: story collapses without lantern craft, dream polishing, and paper ritual.</comment>
