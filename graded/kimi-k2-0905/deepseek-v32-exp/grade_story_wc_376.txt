<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aria’s obsession with vanished conversations is visceral and embodied; her shaking hand at the leaf-vein moment sells it. The lie-wilt mechanic is shown, not labeled, and forces her to hunt for candor in real time. One contradiction pulses: she both mourns lost words and hoards zinc plates that literally store them—yet this tension is left as texture rather than dramatized choice. Final inscription stance is earned; cost is the toxic sky she must re-enter, leaves glowing against it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: fragment discovery → map assembly → archive console keyed by same fragment → hearing stored voices → decision to re-inscribe. Each step tightens options; the postal plate as skeleton key binds set-up to payoff. No teleporting props; the zinc shard is handled early, mid, late. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she turns back into danger carrying the archive’s light, cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse corridors, rust-sorting dome, and child’s water-cache secret are sketched with three-sense economy. The lie-wilt leaves act as micro-setting that constrains conversation choices on the spot. Toxic sky stays off-stage filter until the final line where it presses against the glass, reweighting her return journey. Spatial choreography clean: no floating rooms, distances track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrievable honesty—announced in paragraph two. Pressure escalates via leaf barometer: every lie browns her talismans, forcing her to seek raw candor to revive them. Mid-story tightening when child’s secret perks leaves shows cost altering tactics. Archive reveal doesn’t resolve conflict, it deepens it: she must now shoulder the city’s forgotten truths, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: stored voices vs. living candor. No sentence preaches “truth matters”; instead the gilded leaves physically vote. Final image of glowing leaves against toxic sky re-weights premise—preservation is active, not nostalgic. Subtext in child’s whispered cache links water survival to conversational survival without stating equation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Aria’s perceptual filter: filtered-air breath, zinc taste, leaf-vein tremble. Syntax lengthens during archive flood, then shortens on exit decision. No filter-verb clusters; “she realized” appears once and is paid for by immediate sensory counterpunch. Diction within plausible lexicon—no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence for archive voices, staccato on return. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor risk—“archive choked with rusted sorting machines”—but “choked” is physically apt for air-starved dome, so forgiven. Final line packs three jobs: sky image, leaf glow, mission redefined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of calligraphy-botany-postal archaeology feels fresh; lie-detecting flora reframes eco-fantasy trope. Map-on-zinc rather than paper is specific and inevitable once postal plates appear. Risk taken: quiet archive epiphany instead of chase, paid off by conceptual repricing of stored voices. Incremental freshness over twisty surprise.</comment>
