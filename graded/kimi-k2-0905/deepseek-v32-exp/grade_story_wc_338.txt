<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s “perceptive map framer” identity is concrete—she rolls the map, aligns the tear, compares silent footage—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the widening fissure is discovered, not gambled on. The final emotional softening is tender yet cost is only asserted (“forever deepened”), not dramatized, so the arc stays shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn map finds its whole counterpart on the chapel wall, reweighting known/unknown with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—shifted stones and widened crack are observed rather than provoked—but the pattern is taught early and the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, mossy henge, damp stone under fingertips—details are selective, body-close, and directly guide the reopening action. The frescoed celestial map inside the chapel reprises Elara’s own torn parchment, charging the final image with pinpoint specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Stakes—bridge the torn map’s known/unknown—are signaled early and tighten when the fissure is revealed as the hinge to the chapel. Escalation is observational rather than obstructed; no tangible price is risked or lost, so pressure stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening to silence emerges through concrete beats—comparing mute footage, tracing quiet frescoes, entering hushed chapel—without explicit moralizing. The ending’s image of wholeness inside the torn map offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric tracks Elara’s methodical curiosity with restrained, rhythmic diction (“methodically curious mind,” “shielded openness”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is steady, though syntax occasionally drifts into template cadence (“she felt… she saw… she realized”) that slightly flattens voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and concise, but repetitive scaffold (“she… she… she” openings, “rain-scoured fresco vault” echoed four times) and stacked –ly modifiers (“methodically curious,” “shielded openness”) create mild loop artifacts that dull the closure line. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The silent-video comparison across decades to spot stone-shadow drift is a fresh procedural hook; the torn-map/whole-map closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Over-familiar “ancient henge hides secret chapel” frame and repeated “whispered chapel” tag slightly dilute surprise.</comment>
