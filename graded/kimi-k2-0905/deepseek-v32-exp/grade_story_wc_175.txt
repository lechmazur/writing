<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elian’s collector-of-vanishing-things identity is vivid; the moth-wing knot ritual dramatizes his esoteric realism under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“heart ached with the weight of this final pilgrimage”), avoiding label-speak. The final untying is a micro-choice that visibly costs him the last anchor, earning his transient rootedness. Missing a second on-page contradiction to push him past 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the wing drifts away while the monarch departs, reweighting the entire stake from preservation to release. Causal lens holds—each twig, petal, and knot is a because/therefore step toward that image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “carrying the blushing stillness within him”—the price is lifelong internalization of loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s misty breath and cloud-filtered glow constrain every motion; altitude limits how long the arch can stand. The moth wing’s iridescent veins map literal flight paths, charging the final image when the monarch brushes it. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions. Environment is indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor the last migration—tightens from first line to last wing drift. One meaningful deepening: the knot must be untied, foreclosing permanent preservation; cost is the wing surrendered forever. Pressure accumulates under situational lens as the solitary butterfly’s arrival crystallizes Elian’s stance. No further escalation needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through image and gesture: interrupted cadence becomes honored cadence when the wing is released. No moralizing; the final image is a non-literal answer—loss transmuted into beauty. Subtext lives in the silence between wing and butterfly. Resonance reweights all prior twig-and-petal craft as ephemeral monuments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate keeps strict POV discipline; perceptual signature is biased toward vanishing iridescence and moss breath. Rhythmic control peaks in the short, breath-held sentences as the monarch circles. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Elian’s esoteric lexicon. Voice modulation mirrors his rising stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long inhalations of description to clipped, heartbeat fragments at climax. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors (“blushing stillness”) are coherent and paid off. Minor density of figurative language in one beat prevents 9.0 but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: endangered-species elegy meets ephemeral land-art ritual. The monarch-as-last-signal and wing-as-key is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. Transformation test passes—swap wing or grotto and the story collapses.</comment>
