<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“his world recently shattered,” “panicked breath to sharpen focus”) and fears are embodied, but Leo’s contradiction—declaring vulnerability power—arrives as a thematic summary at the climax rather than being dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs him on the page. Eli functions only as a prop-trigger; no relationship pressure or status shift is tested. The seashell’s whisper is atmospherically used but never alters Leo’s tactical choices; its meaning is asserted, not enacted. Earned stasis is claimed (“he walked away, forever changed”) yet the on-page cost is emotional assertion rather than a foreclosed path we watch him refuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: betrayal → shell → decrypt → tower confrontation. Orientation anchors within 120 words and the inferred lens (Causal) holds to closure. Closure is a Decisive Change—Leo openly confronts Silas—but the “felt cost” is rhetorical (“his certainty no longer trembling”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on-page, slightly softening the CR requirement. No teleporting props or outline-drag; every beat advances knowledge or option narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rusted library, oxidized metal, ivy, star-pierced roof—selected sensory details mirror Leo’s corrosion-to-light arc and constrain movement (leaning shelves force cautious steps). Micro-setting rule satisfied: the shell-as-object is repeatedly handled, its pearlescent cracks echoing roof-starlight in the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; Leo kneels, leads Eli out, walks to tower without impossible jumps. Environment never evolves (no weather, no shifting debris underfoot), keeping it just shy of 9-level constraint-on-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove vulnerability is power—signaled early and tightened at the clock-tower confrontation. Escalation is singular but meaningful: decryption of the cast-code forces Leo to embrace the very height-phobia Silas exploits. Cost is conceptual (public exposure of fear) yet not tangibly felt—no sprained ankle, no lost ally, no social credit visibly forfeited—so pressure stays psychological rather than tactical. Protagonist agency drives the turn; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the stunt-man’s inversion of weakness-to-weapon; no final-paragraph moralizing. Subtext resides in shell-whisper and starlight rather than explicit assertion. Resonant reconfiguration is attempted—fear becomes strength—but because the cost is abstract, the aftereffect is slightly intellectual rather than viscerally charged. Complexity is present yet tidy; ambiguity limited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres cleanly to Leo’s perceptual filter: “scent of oxidized metal,” “trembling certainty.” Syntax grows clipped under stress (“He knelt, his hands steady despite the inner tremor”), mirroring stunt-beat timing. No dialogue to judge; interior voice avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains consistent diction. Seashell whisper risks ventriloquing thematic message but stays within POV plausibility as hallucinated urging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: one sentence often does two jobs (“clutching the whispering seashell half—a cracked, pearlescent heirloom…”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (rust, ivy, stars). Occasional elevated phrasing (“sibilant urgings coil”) is brief and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; paragraph cut test passed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double + cryptanalysis + phobia-as-code-key is non-obvious and memorable. Shell-whisper risks familiar mystic-object trope but redeems by linking to maternal loss. “Trembling certainty” tone feels novel yet apt. No close echoes of famous scenes; concept commits fully. Risk-taking is moderate—structurally linear—but specificity of stunt-world detail provides authenticity.</comment>
