<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Leo’s “weightless burden” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as contradictory impulse; interiority drifts into abstract labels (“quiet pride”) instead of embodied cost. No micro-choice after the mainspring find shows him weighing risk or refusal; he simply proceeds up the ladder. The ghosts’ release feels donated rather than earned by a visible decision that costs him anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—he pockets the barrel and drives away—but the cost is asserted, not shown: no foreclosed future, no constraint that will shape tomorrow’s calls. Causal chain is thin: the dust pattern points, he climbs, listens, promises; the ghosts vanish without demanding a renunciation that hurts. Under Causal lens the story progresses by “and-then” more than “because-therefore.”</comment>

<comment>Setting supplies tactile micro-details—erratic fluorescent, thin dust patch, drop-ceiling rafters—that guide Leo’s hands and eyes. The circus office never exerts active resistance or limited resource; it’s backdrop rather than crucible. Still, the specificity of the dust analysis and the crack above the plaster cleanly anchors spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—remains static; no reversal tightens or raises the price. The clockmaker’s sorrow adds emotional density but does not force Leo to sacrifice or renounce any live option. Escalation is accumulative/textural: more ghosts appear, ledgers stack, but options do not narrow and no felt cost is exacted from the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of repairing past wrongs through listening emerges organically from Leo’s methodical dust-reading and the ghosts’ stories. Final claim that he “mended the past” is a touch overt, blunting subtext. The mainspring barrel reprises as museum donation, a modest reweighting that avoids moralizing but lacks piercing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays snug to Leo’s repair-tech perceptual filter—hearing buzz, noticing wear patterns, pocketing metal. Syntax is serviceable, rhythm steady; no signature cadence or idiosyncratic diction elevates the prose into memorability. No dialogue to test voice distinctiveness; narrative voice consistent but generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Scaffold phrasing recurs—“the weightless burden,” “he mended more than elevators”—creating echo loops that dull momentum. Some sentences list micro-actions without pressure: “He packed his tools, the horologist’s mainspring barrel safely in his pocket.” Generally clear, but tightening could cut 10% without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Marrying elevator repair to ghost-whispering is fresh; using dust-pattern forensics to uncover circus fraud is clever and specific. Yet the ghost-restoration plot follows a familiar benevolent-medium template without subverting it. Risk level is moderate; execution competent but not transformative.</comment>
