<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “unused love” is visceral, embodied in her tactile hunger for the film; her spatial imagination is more than label, guiding how she navigates the mnemonic vault. Interior contradiction is alive—she both covets and pities the sealed pain—yet the final vow to serve as conduit is a credibly renunciative stance that forecloses self-gratification. No second character on stage, so relational bullets waived; still, the solitary micro-choices (hand poised, crystal warming) reveal a hierarchy that privileges cosmic balance over personal solace. Cost is felt: she leaves the booth emptied, story transferred, paths foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of emotional relics builds until the cadence shift (“the tune was found…in the act of remembering”) reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara stands in the dim hallway, crystal glowing, guardian of unheard goodbyes—options reconfigured, cost felt as lifelong burden. Causality holds: each psychometric touch → vision → incubation → sworn stewardship. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Only hairline slip: “hushed thunder” metaphor is repeated enough to flirt with loop, but it pays off in final cadence, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth is evoked through tools (metal table, brittle celluloid) and sensory漏斗—dust motes, cool celluloid like skin—filtering Elara’s synesthetic gaze. Micro-setting (the coiled strip) doubles as emotional compass, constraining her hand placement and later reappearing as the emptied relic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: body → table → strip → vision vault → hallway exit, each step tracked. Final image of crystal resonating with “hushed thunder” charges the setting with conceptual afterlife, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate & release unused love—announced early and tightened by each psychometric dive: every crystalline letter narrows her future to stewardship. One meaningful escalation: the moment she grasps a humming shard, the reservoir’s cumulative sigh becomes personal debt. Cost is visible—she exits “emptied,” path foreclosed. Agency is accumulative rather than decisively reversal-based, fitting Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific relics (letters → crystals) rather than thesis: love unused is matter, not metaphor. Final image reweights premise—guardianship is the tune—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the unheard goodbyes sing louder than any dialogue. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader left hearing the hushed thunder of their own sealed affections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s synesthetic register: “room…a nexus of intersecting light paths,” diction precise yet lyric. Rhythm modulates—long inhalation sentences in booth, staccato shards in vault—mirroring perceptual shift. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Filter verbs (“felt like skin”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Psychic distance clean: no head-hop, no knowledge leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence builds from dust-moted hush to crystalline crescendo without template repetition. Metaphors are sparse, selective, never stacked; “sleeping serpent” appears once and pays off in transferred energy. Information density high—each sentence advances image or stakes; no scaffold or synonym loops. Closure line (“the unused love had a guardian now”) is crisp, propulsive, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—psychometric cartography of sealed affection—is fresh, yet grounded in single vintage object. Synthesis of crystal gazing + film archives + spatial metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric repetition (“hushed thunder”) is embraced and paid off in final cadence, heightening coherence. Transformation test fails: story collapses without film strip’s specific chemical ghost.</comment>
