<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet drumbeat” motive is stated, not embodied; she deciphers passively, never risking anything or altering tactics. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply reads until insight arrives. The mirrored loneliness with the captain is touching but external; her own emotional cost never materializes on the page. End-state is unearned stasis, not a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: joy = transformed anguish, cost felt in the captain’s sacrificed crew. Accumulative lens holds: each floor thickens thematic density rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 40 words; single-scene default met. No reversal or narrowing of options—pressure plateaus rather than tightens, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ice shaft, prismatic light, and brass cage are tactile, filtered through Elara’s servant gaze. Goggle-refracted ink is a lovely micro-setting that enables decoding; spire ice literally whispers, charging final image. Environment doesn’t constrain movement but does supply the only tool that unlocks meaning. Sufficient specificity and tool integration for 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stake—find joy beneath anguish—is signaled early yet remains abstract; no external obstacle opposes ascent. Pressure accumulates via diary revelations, but Elara’s options never narrow; she could stop reading with zero cost. One meaningful tightening is absent; climax is recognition, not trade-off. Coincidence (diary placement) complicates only, so lens coherence holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from captain’s micro-joys against ruin; final reweighting is implicit, not sermonized. Subtext of shared solitude is handled quietly via mirrored ascent. avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers whether servant will act on insight. Slight abstraction of “joy beneath anguish” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited adheres cleanly; perceptual signature is cool, observant, servant-class—attention to metal chill, light play. Prose tilts slightly literary but stays within Elara’s lexicon. No dialogue to test distinction. Rhythm breathes with elevator grind; no head-hopping or filter clutter. Voice stable under mild pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length; strong verbs (“pattering,” “pierced,” “shuddered”) propel. Occasional modifier stacks (“warmly inquisitive anticipation”) flirt with overwrite but sparse enough to avoid artifact. No loops or paraphrase scars. Punctuation clean; opening and closing images echo neatly. One mixed metaphor (“needle of frost and silence”) barely dents clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Frost-elevator as memory-ascension device is fresh; diary decoded by refracted light is elegant tech. Core trope—finding hope in another’s loss—is timeless but re-animate through ice-spire specificity. Risk is modest; structure stays safe linear climb. Transformation feels inevitable yet not derivative; avoids quirky-for-quirky’s-sake ornament.</comment>
