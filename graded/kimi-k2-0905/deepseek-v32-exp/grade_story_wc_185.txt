<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is tactile—stone warmth, fingertip ice-reading—showing contradictory impulses (preserve old song vs weave alien vibration). The earned renunciation—she walks away leaving the stone—carries visible fatigue cost. Minor slip: “hammered repose” abstracts the climax instead of letting body register it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each ice-crack read therefore tightens her conjuring options until the silence wave lands. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: stone left glowing in niche crystallizes new balance, cost legible in her knee-buckling exhaustion. One causality nick: energy beings’ shift from chaos to cooperation is summarized not shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Harmonic caves function as micro-setting: ice fractures become readable maps that literally constrain her next move; echo chamber stone’s glow guides hand and eye under gloom. Sensory economy—cool stone, frozen tears—mirrors internal quest for calm without overt symbolism. Final image of dancing energy beings re-codes the space itself, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—tightens when each ice pattern forecloses wrong frequencies; visible price is rising stone heat and bodily exhaustion. Agency sits in conjuring acts; no external antagonist needed. Cost is present but could be sharper: conjuring fatigue described rather than dramatized in a single vivid beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony is not erasure but integration of alien song. Final image—energy beings’ silent poetry—reweights earlier dissonance into new resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; meaning stays in物象. Ambiguity lingers: will future mapkeepers maintain this fragile alloy?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature—sound as texture, ice as text—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythmic swells mimic cavern acoustics; diction stays within plausible mapkeeper lexicon (“resonant nodes,” “ripple-marks”). One micro-slip: “hammered repose” borders on coined abstraction, but cadence justifies it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, tactile, and mythic data without scaffold. Metaphors (ice as frozen tears, bloom of hush) stay coherent and grounded. No loops or synonym churn; clauses vary naturally. Opening and closing lines bookend with stone glow, achieving circular ear-test satisfaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cymatics, caving, and alien vibration feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic fantasy mine—specificity of ice-map reading and echo-stone acoustics anchors it. Risk in lyric compression pays off: quiet ending reconfigures meaning without gimmick. Minor proximity to “song of the earth” trope, but context re-codes it.</comment>
