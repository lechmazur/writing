<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s “infinite patience” is stated repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulse or visible cost; his interiority is lyrically sketched (“infinitely patient gaze”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The only micro-choice—striking the fork and pacing—never risks failure or forces a trade-off, so the motion feels serene rather than crucible-forged. No flaw complicates his mastery, so the characterization is evocative but flat, short of the 9-band demand for embodied contradiction and paid cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each footstep and fork-hum layers density until the ghost-town air itself “hums” in a Charged Poise. Causality is metaphorical—rhythm revives memory—but the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: the living must now keep the beat alive. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; the town’s nameless status is deliberate disorientation that pays off at closure. Closure lands with felt cost (“the wild hush returned, but now filled with life”), satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “ancient archway” and cobblestone rhythm function as micro-setting: their physical response to vibration literally enables the revival, charging the final image. Selective sensory triangulation—dust devils, gleaming stones, low hum—keeps description lean yet atmospheric. Spatial choreography is pristine; every footfall and fork-strike is locatable. Environment constrains the only possible tactic—keep pacing—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: restore balance before the collapse recurs. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification (shimmer, whispers, solidifying shadows) rather than causal reversal; the tightening is poetic but not option-narrowing. No visible price is paid by Elian—no exhaustion, doubt, or forfeiture—so the cost is atmospheric rather than personal. Sufficient for high band, but the missing personal toll blocks 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communal memory persists as vibrational pattern, revivable only by disciplined attention. The fork’s ebony sheen and the child’s final laugh reweight the concept of “shared balance” without abstract assertion. No moral is stated; the ending image of perpetual song invites reflection on caretaking labor. Subtle, non-didactic, and resonant—near 9+ but slightly undercut by the cost being cosmological rather than human-scaled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering every perception through Elian’s tuned senses. Syntax mirrors his metronomic method—short, weighted clauses that pulse like footsteps. No filter-verb clutter; “He struck the fork against a stone, and a low hum emanated” is direct and sensory. The voice is distinctive, sustained, and appropriate to the accumulative design; hairline short of 9+ only because the diction never cracks under stress—remains too serene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet musical; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the rhythm motif. Information density high—“dust devils danced in silence” does three jobs in five words. Minor drumbeat repetition of “infinitely patient” is the single hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The “bell tuner revives ghosts via footfall resonance” is a fresh synthesis of sound-healing and hauntology; not a trope template. Specificity of the ebony fork, the archway’s pulse, and the child’s thin laugh roots the concept in sensuous detail. Risk is taken with the accumulative structure rather than causal plot, and it pays off in a Charged Poise. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet original on first read—solid high-band ingenuity.</comment>
