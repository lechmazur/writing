<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s burned-spy identity and self-appointed redemptive mission are cleanly anchored; interiority is concrete (“the silver surface worn smooth by years of covert touches”). The pillbox-handling micro-choices show hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the final smile-while-bleeding image crystallizes earned cost, yet the pivotal vouchsafe moment is slightly under-dramatized, muting the full force of character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: snow-code discovery → descent → cabin rendezvous → transmission → wound. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elias bleeds but “the world felt whole again.” One tight scaffold—”the tilt of the earth toward spring” reappears to reweight meaning—justifies the lyric echo. Minor elasticity: the enemy shot arrives with minimal setup, a late coincidence that slightly dilutes prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mist-cold air, snow patterns, and engraved pillbox texture are filtered through Elias’s spy perception; the pillbox acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean from bluff to cabin to ridge. Weather both cloaks and reveals, directly shaping stealth choices. “Silver hush” motif risks over-saturation but is saved by final reweighting at the bleeding close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose traitors to mend broken trust—signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: transmission narrows options to live-or-die. Cost is visible (bullet, blood), but earlier stake of “unused courage” is more conceptual than viscerally tested; Anya’s awakening is secondary, softening the dominant pressure peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through self-appointed sacrifice emerges via concrete imagery rather than statement. The tilt/spring motif reconfigured from fragile hope to post-shot acceptance supplies resonant reconfiguration. Avoids explicit moralizing, but the “world felt whole again” line flirts with over-tidy resonance, keeping it shy of the 8-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is sharp (“codes he had come to decipher”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ascent, staccato taps at cabin door. No dialogue contamination; sparse lines carry subtext. “Silver hush” refrain is purposeful pattern, taught early and paid off in final bleed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“The silver hush of the bluff was profound, muffling sound and thought alike”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent; “mist coiling like forgotten secrets” is fresh yet compressed. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) fits spy idiolect without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Spy-redemption arc is familiar, but snow-code navigation and pillbox-as-drive twist add fresh angle. The “tilt of the earth” lyrical frame elevates premise. Transformation test passes: pillbox and snow codes are inseparable from this exact plot. Slight genre comfort keeps it below 8-band apex.</comment>
