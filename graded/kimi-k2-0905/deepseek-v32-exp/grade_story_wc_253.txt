<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s numb compliance and secret carving create a usable contradiction, but the piece never lets her make a micro-choice that actually changes her risk or tightens her dilemma; she only narrates and whittles. The interiority is vivid (“desiccated but still holding a form”) yet stays static, so the promised moral ambiguity never complicates action on the page. Because the ending is pure stasis—no new wager or forfeiture—the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Elara holding the crumbling bouquet crystallizes her impossible stance with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of whittle/narrate/shadow deepens until the hush and dust feel terminal. However, the piece never squeezes her between real alternatives; the stake never tightens, only repeats. One decisive squeeze or forfeiture would push this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbine shadows, and brittle petals are filtered through Elara’s deadened attention; each detail is tactile and purpose-built, never touristic. The turbines’ sweeping bars physically constrain her movements and echo the Mandate’s surveillance, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the bouquet in her numb fingers) directly shapes the last beat, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the absence of weather or seasonal evolution keeps it just below the top tier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to keep betraying neighbors to protect her private grief—never advances past initial statement; no new infraction or inspector visit raises the cost. Pressure is atmospheric but static; the turbine shadows and whirring never translate into an imminent fork. A single beat where reporting someone actually backfires or where a carved symbol is almost discovered would escalate stakes into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the privatization of sorrow under compulsory joy. The dried bouquet’s gradual disintegration reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—“desiccated but still holding a form”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A crisper conceptual repricing (e.g., a carved symbol left where an inspector might find it) would nudge it past 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flat, performative narration is consistent and character-specific; syntactic repetition mirrors her mechanical mask. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices wood grain, dust motes, turbine shadows in a desiccated hierarchy. No head-hopping or register drift. Minor over-telling in the reflective paragraphs slightly dilutes immediacy, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; clauses breathe with the scrape of the knife. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“skeleton of color”). No loops or scaffold, but occasional adjective stacks (“manufactured and deep”) slightly slacken momentum. Clean copy; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The Happiness Mandate trope is familiar, but the coupling of whittling-as-clandestine-mourning and the turbine-shadow panopticon feels freshly synthesized. Risk is taken: a protagonist who never cracks her mask yet compels empathy. The concept commits fully; no retreat into sentimentality. A sharper external jeopardy beat would push ingenuity higher.</comment>
