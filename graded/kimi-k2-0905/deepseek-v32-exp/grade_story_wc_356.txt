<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition is embodied in her stained fingers and nightly journal ritual; the olfactory gift is shown, not told, and directly enables the climactic scent-shift that cracks the seed. Interior contradiction—ambition vs. patience—stays active in scene, culminating in the earned micro-choice to stop forcing growth. The cost is quiet but legible: she accepts a slower, humbler cultivation, foreclosing her previous urgency. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority stays particular and unsentimental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed cracks as Elara’s stance flips from control to harmony, reweighting the village’s shared belief system. Causality is accumulative/textural: repeated scent micro-shifts accumulate until the pattern break (wet-stone aroma) coincides with her internal flip. The 120-word anchor test is passed by line 5; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the final hush—her ambition thorn is replaced by patient motion—making the tide-turn literal and conceptual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Treetop village is evoked through motion—creaking basket, swaying bridges—rather than postcard catalog. Olfactory topography dominates: soil, ozone, decay, each filtered by Elara’s professional priorities. The seed itself serves as micro-setting that constrains every beat; its changing scent-state alters her tactics. Spatial choreography is tight: balcony pot, journal on knee, wind direction tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she germinate the seed—tightens when the new scent forecloses her old forcing methods. One meaningful deepening: the shift from “I must make it grow” to “I must listen to its timing” narrows her options and reweights the village’s oral wisdom. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and sensory. Cost is conceptual—her identity as ambitious prodigy is quietly surrendered—but visible in the final image of her calm exhale.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: cultivation as listening rather than mastery. No abstract statements; the insight is borne by the seed’s literal crack and the hush that follows. The wrapping-paper journal—ancestral doodles—quietly rebels against oral tradition, yet ends by integrating both systems. Final image reweights prior material: the “tide of thought” becomes the shared village hush, a conceptual repricing of collective knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual signature—scent-first, color-second, sound-third. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments under scent-shock, mirroring attention narrowing. No head-hopping; village “we” is external collective, not POV shift. Diction remains within her herbalist lexicon—“olfactorily,” “enriched soil,” “wrinkled thing”—without thesaurus drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sensory sentences alternate with staccato scent notations. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances scent knowledge or emotional stance. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“wildflower hush” is the only compressed metaphor, paid off in final line. Filter verbs minimal and justified; “she realized” appears once at epiphany but is immediately anchored to embodied exhalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “stubborn seed” trope is refreshed through olfactory epistemology: knowledge arrives by smell, not speech. Treetop village and wrapping-paper journals are specific inventions that could not be swapped into another tale without collapse. Risky lyric compression—“turning of the tide’s thought”—lands because scent metaphor has been taught early. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
