<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—needing coincidences to mean something yet fearing they might not—remains embodied in her trembling fingers on the shard. Micro-choices (angling each fragment while retrocognitive flashes sear her temples) enact a visible cost: blood on silica, breath held until the beam blooms. The ending credibly crystallizes her renunciation of randomness, but the story stops short of letting her flaw trip her; the cost is felt yet not compounded by an interior mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gentle beam rewrites the rule of “shard of hush” without exposition, letting the final image carry undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: star-path tracking → prism angles → retrocognitive cues → light burst; no ellipsis break. The 120-word orientation anchor is clean—glass pavilion, post-Collapse night, solitary custodian—so no penalty. One minor scaffold appears (“she realized…”) but it’s outside the climax and does not dull the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass ribs that hum in wind and slice moonlight into spectral needles function as micro-setting; their vibration literally guides the angle at which Elara sets the fragments. Star-path brass instruments, fused-silica dust, and the violet sky are filtered through her goal-biased perception, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is tight—no impossible body-to-lens shifts—and weather (rising wind) is causally looped into both the pavilion’s song and the final beam alignment, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—isolated settlements starved of guidance—tightens when the prism array refuses to spark until the last fragment meets Vega; that single deepening narrows options from “hope” to “this angle or eternal dark.” Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each retrocognitive flash adds pattern density until the light burst reweights the stake. Cost is visible: lacerated fingertips, breath held so long her ribs sting, and the implicit future burden of keeping the beacon alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: randomness vs. meaning is tested by whether a broken prism can be coaxed to catch starlight. The humming pavilion’s final harmonic answers—coincidence is a tuning fork waiting for a hand. No character states the moral; instead the beam itself re-prices the world’s rule-set. Subtext in the caretaker’s hum (earlier vision) charges the closing chord, making the insight feel earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory bandwidth—no leakage into omniscience. Syntax lengthens and fragments under pressure (“A pinprick… grew… burst…”) mirroring her breathless suspense. Diction stays within a stargazing tech lexicon without academic drift. Distinct perceptual signature—she “weaves retrocognitive glimpses into a coherent map”—separates narrator from character voice, satisfying 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm climbs from low wind-hum to staccato beat matches the mounting tension; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (“thistle-blown hope,” “shard of hush”) and both return to charge closure. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances angle, memory, or sensation. One near-scaffold “she realized” is offset by immediate sensory payoff, so artifact does not touch the climax. High density: “blood on silica” simultaneously shows injury, stakes, and material fragility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-relighting is familiar, but the fusion of retrocognitive astronomy with wind-tuned glass gives the trope a fresh tonal resonance. The “shard of hush” concept reweights silence from void to pregnant space—a non-obvious conceptual turn. Specificity of brass star notches versus intuitive humming prism keeps the world from feeling generic. Risk remains conceptual rather than structural, so no bonus, yet the synthesis feels particular to this voice.</comment>
