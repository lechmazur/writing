<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her attention to light, moss, the pendant’s warmth. The offering to Leo crystallizes her shift from shame to shared future; the quiet pact earns its cost in on-page trust. Secondary pressure minimal, but the two-handed scene sustains clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drip, moss trace, and pendant hand-off layers density until the final image reweights the viral confession as “brutal pruning.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the pendant on Leo’s neck makes the new pact undeniable with felt cost. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting does triple duty: cathedral-green data center constrains movement, supplies the icicle-drip blueprint, and mirrors internal thaw. The amber pendant as micro-setting recurs and finally charges the closing image. Sensory economy favors moss scent, sun shafts, pendant warmth—never catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live after public exposure—tightens once: the pendant offering forecloses retreat into solitary shame. Cost is visible when Leo wears the amber, accepting shared vulnerability. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but legitimate under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through green reclamation imagery: viral shame as compost, icicle map as blueprint for deliberate regrowth. No articulated thesis; final image of pendant-as-compass reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the graft take?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: “honeyed hush,” “watchful dreamer,” syntax remains quiet, rhythmic, unpunctuated by jargon. No head-hop; Leo’s interior accessed only through gesture and her reading. Voice modulation under stress—shorter sentences at pendant hand-off—feels intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “honeyed hush” and “cathedral of green” compress tone + setting + stakes in four syllables. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, none in closure sentence. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) stays within narrator’s conceptual lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Freshened trope: post-cancellation sanctuary is literal server ruin colonized by moss, not metaphoric café. Icicle-drip map as blueprint for healing feels specific to this place. Risk: quiet lyric ending could feel familiar, but pendant transfer converts trope into earned action.</comment>
