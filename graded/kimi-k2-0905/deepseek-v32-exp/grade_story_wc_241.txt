<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory filial grief and intellectual hunger are viscerally embodied (the lantern trembles when she thinks of his chalk dust). The micro-choice to keep reading the journal even as the candle gutters crystallizes her renunciation of his compulsive path with felt cost: “She extinguished the candle, knowing the light of knowledge must be handled with care.” Interiority avoids label-speak, but the final moral calculus still tilts a touch tidy.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly via Conceptual Repricing: the journal reweights probability from “beat the odds” to “live the paradox,” with visible cost—she leaves the library lantern-cold, stance forever altered. Causal chain holds: subway scrawl → library → journal → renunciation. One soft spot: the midsummer anchoring drifts until paragraph 5, but the later payoff waives Orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rain-slick stone, damp-paper scent, and the mica pane’s fracturing glow are selectively filtered through Elara’s probability-trained eye, charging the final image. The lantern as micro-setting constrains her choice to extinguish it, embodying the “fragile illumination” thesis. Spatial choreography stays clean across subway → platform → stacks → exit. No environmental detail is idle; even the clover scent outside the library sharpens the tonal paradox.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem inherited risk-taking through responsible interpretation—tightens when the smudged scrawl forces a real traverse, then again when the journal’s regrets confront her with irreversible stakes. Agency is legible: she chooses to teach, foreclosing the gambler’s path. Cost is felt (the candle’s deliberate extinction), though the external world offers no antagonistic push-back beyond the father’s absence; escalation is mostly internal, sufficient for this lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between probability’s certainty and life’s randomness; the final image of the lantern’s unlit mica pane re-prices that tension without moralizing. Recurrent motifs—scrawls, equations, candle shadows—accumulate meaning rather than decorate, culminating in the paradox that “some truths are paradoxes.” Subtext in gesture (finger brushing “spines of regret”) outruns any explicit thesis, inviting reflective after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a mathematically tinged diction (“stochastic hush,” “kaleidoscope of shadows”) that feels native to the POV yet never swerves into lecture. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic train motion, then fragment at the heart-attack memory, aligning cadence with pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Elara’s probability-filtered attention. Dialogue is absent by design and the prose compensates with subtextual interior action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density lines (“probability professor’s daughter, would read its patterns with both rigor and heart”) compress occupation, lineage, method and theme in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent (rainwashed stone = “clover melancholy of renewal and decay”) and propel rather than stall. No scaffold loops or synonym churn detected; only a single template cadence near the end (“With each traversal, each interpreted message…”) but it serves as intentional accumulation, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “grief pilgrimage” scaffold is retooled through the city’s graffiti-probability cipher, making the urban text itself a living syllabus. The lantern-mica pane repurposes a standard symbol into a scientific talisman whose fracture pattern literalizes uncertainty. Synthesis of math-culture argot with raw filial sorrow feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (quiet ending, no external antagonist) pays off by crystallizing conceptual cost rather than melodrama.</comment>
