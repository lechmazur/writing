<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s linguist identity is shown decoding the diary, but interiority stays generic (“she remained calmly resourceful”). Kael’s panic is declared, not embodied. The final renunciation—accepting the library’s echo inside her—arrives without prior contradiction or visible cost, so the beat feels tagged on rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: diary gap → library path → Kael’s confession → timeline heal. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara stays, “lessons silently echo,” cost felt. One soft spot: the library’s shift-to-intention rule is declared late, not seeded, so the turn feels lightly retroactive rather than foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore breathes: stone shelves, mist, floating tomes humming. Diary as micro-setting constrains choice—pressed leaves, fragile pages guide每一步. Spatial track stays clean; no floating props. Final image of glowing hall recharges earlier “glimmering” motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find library to avert paradox—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: shift from “find book” to “confront own error” redefines mission. Cost is Kael’s shame and Elara’s eternal stewardship, both legible. Escalation is linear, not recursive, satisfying short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through owning error emerges via Kael’s reading, not sermon. “Unheard symphony” motif moves from metaphor to embodied pull, reweighted in final “swell to crescendo.” No overt moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Minor abstraction in “lessons silently echo” keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her methodical lens: “she cross-referenced gaps…” Rhythm calms under pressure, consistent with character. One register wobble: “temporal ethics” sounds academic for POV, but isolated. Diary decoding shows perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high density: “volumes piled high into the misty peaks” does two jobs. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“unheard symphony”) are limited, coherent, pattern-taught early. Closing sentence lands with varied cadence, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rescue-the-library trope is refreshed by botanical-diary cipher and mountain bookstore scale. Diary-as-map feels specific, not borrowed. Risk taken: quiet interior ending rather than spectacle. Could push higher if paradox mechanism had non-generic physics.</comment>
