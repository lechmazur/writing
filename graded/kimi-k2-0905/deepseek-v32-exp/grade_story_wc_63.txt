<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s guilt-soaked diligence is tangible in every micro-adjustment; the embodied memory of flood-water screams keeps his interiority specific. The broken-rake-handle cipher gives his grandfather a ghost-presence that pressures the present choice. Final self-forgiveness is earned beat-by-beat through visible calibrations, not declared. A hairline slip into “incremental absolution” label-speak at the climax keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each micro-turn of the bob is a because/therefore response to the remembered flood and the ridge’s tidal threat. Orientation is immediate; the tower, ridge and pause-at-apex are anchored by line 3. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s true arc reweights decades of self-punishment with felt cost—“the weight of the world lifted” is the visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Brass gears, obsidian black, tidal groan and moonlit receding wave are filtered through Elias’s obsessive sensory hierarchy. The tower’s spiral stairs and workbench spatial track remain coherent across the single scene. The rake handle micro-setting constrains the decisive recalibration; its tactile inscription guides the final image. One missed olfactory cue (salt-air absence in the clock room) is the only hairline gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore shared balance to avert another flood—tightens when the hitch is noticed and narrows to a single micro-adjustment choice. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each fractional turn of the bob is an irreversible wager against the sea. The visible cost is the decades of trembling guilt compacted into one smooth arc; forgiveness is the forfeiture of self-flagellation. No coincidence intrudes; the tide only threatens, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of absolution emerges from tactile particulars—brass filings, inscribed wood, pendulum pause—never abstract sermon. The final silence after the last swing reconfigures meaning: balance is not perfection but steady ongoing tending. Moral complexity stays intact; the village will never know how close the hitch came. Only a whisper of therapeutic phrasing (“he found the strength to forgive himself”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: he notices gear-tooth shadows, not seabirds. Syntax shortens under stress—“minute turn by turn”—mirroring the pendulum’s breath. No dialogue appears; therefore voice-distinction bullets are waived. The rake-handle idiom feels inherited, not generic, because the grandfather’s diction is carved, not spoken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses with the clock’s cadence; sentence length mirrors pendulum arcs. Information density is high—“tidal obsidian ridge” collapses geology, color and menace into three syllables. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter. A single paraphrase loop—“incremental absolution” repeated three times—blunts the peak beat by −0.2, otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Clock-winder-as-penitent is familiar, but the grandfather’s micro-inscription cipher on a broken rake handle is a fresh, specific inheritance device. The ridge’s obsidian/black-stone metaphor transforms a scenic backdrop into an emotional pressure plate. Risk is taken in quiet lyric closure rather than catastrophic flood; the choice pays off in earned stasis. Slight deduction for near-echoes of “weight of the world” idiom.</comment>
