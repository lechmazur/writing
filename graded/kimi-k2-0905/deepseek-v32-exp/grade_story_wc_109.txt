<comment>The oracle’s “mild obsession” is the only interior motive we ever get; it is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse under pressure. She performs the ritual perfectly, without setback or micro-choice that would reveal flaw or cost, so the final “profound peace” feels pre-ordained rather than earned. The booklet glows, the star pulses, the map appears—she remains static, a spectator to her own magic.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the glowing booklet delivers a spiritual map and the single star brightens, re-weighting the silence. Cost, however, is only aesthetic (gold leaf flakes on fingers); nothing is foreclosed for the oracle herself, so the turn feels vicarious. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the absence of causal risk keeps the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, ancient stones, and the singular star create an immediate, tactile stage; the body-as-setting is evoked through her chilled bones and robe whispers. The gold booklet’s flaking leaf is a micro-setting that literally charges the final image when it glows. Selective sensory economy (no taste, no smell) keeps the lyric register intact without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are abstract—“comfort for lost souls in endless night”—and never localize into a concrete risk or ticking clock for the oracle herself. Pressure is atmospheric (ambered hush) rather than a narrowing of options; the single meaningful tightening is the booklet’s glow, but it resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid by her; the escalation is purely decorative.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: silence as a cartography of consolation. The final image of glowing lines on gold leaf reprises the opening pebble-shore memory without verbal moralizing. Yet because the oracle’s interior is static, the theme remains observational rather than wrestled-with, keeping it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric is consistent, with controlled cadence and perceptual signature: “robes whispering,” “marbled hush,” “veined stone.” The oracle’s diction stays within a mystic seer’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters intrude. Compression is purposeful; patterned repetition (“summarizing silence”) teaches its own music and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the ritual pace; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase (“ambered hush”) is voice-motivated and stays legible. The only nit is slight scaffold in “she retold the silence of…” used thrice; not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Summarize silence into a map” is a fresh inversion of oracle lore, and the gold booklet as stylus is specific. Yet the plot arc—mystic performs ritual, ritual succeeds—follows familiar lyric-fantasy contours without subversion. The pebble-shore memory adds a granular detail that feels idiosyncratic, but the overall conceptual risk is modest.</comment>
