<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant duty → stubborn need to guide is vivid; the shift to “quiet acceptance” lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete (“graceless beauty” perception, nut’s cool shell). Micro-choices (ducking bronze bird, timing light-arrows) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Flaw: single-scene window keeps relationships off-page; no secondary pressure, so crucible angle muted—caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: inherited curse → hears cries → assembles nut-device → projects arrows → family escapes before frost. Closure is Charged Poise: “broken, beautiful song” reweights orchard bond with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 70; no teleporting props. One soft spot: blueprint’s “offhandedly exact” trait could be motivated earlier; slight causal thinning but doesn’t break chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (nut, quartz, copper twist) functions as charged tool that constrains assembly pace and final dismantling. Cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds supply immediate spatial pressure; birds’ grinding gears tighten threat. Sensory balance—visual arrows, cool shell, wind-borne whispers—filtered through Elara’s caretaker bias. Environment directly shapes tactics: duck outcrop, timed projections; setting charges final image of frost on gnarled trees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save three travelers before lethal frost—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation via tightening patrols and dropping temperature; each arrow projection narrows Elara’s safety. Cost legible: warmer device, frost crystals forming, birds’ noose tightening. Agency remains hers throughout; no luck rescue. Could use one visceral loss (bruised knee, cracked quartz) to push higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant caretaker embracing graceless beauty emerges through imagery, not sermon. “Broken, beautiful song” reprises earlier “graceless beauty” without moralizing. Subtext in mechanical birds—awkward yet mesmerizing—mirrors Elara’s own clumsy precision. Final image reweights cursed orchard from chain to bittersweet vocation; ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—gnarled shimmer, bronze whir, frost crystals—feels caretaker-biased. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during bird near-miss, then lengthens at frost arrival. Diction within lexicon; “graceless beauty” motif consistent. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustained through filtered perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density: “shimmered with malevolent light” does visual + moral work. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors clean. One paraphrase loop: “graceless beauty” repeated twice within 40 words—minor. Closing line “silent guardian in a world of graceless beauty” lands with cadence lift; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—cursed orchard, mechanical maze—made specific via nut-device blueprint and “offhandedly exact” method. Synthesis of orchard-curse energy into benevolent tool feels organic; not a checklist. Risk: lyric compresses rescue off-page, but choice supports quiet closure. Fresh angle on reluctant stewardship without redemption arc.</comment>
