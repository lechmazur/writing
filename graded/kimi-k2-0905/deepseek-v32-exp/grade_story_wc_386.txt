<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is evocative—his glacier shrine rituals and dream-snooping feel lived-in—but the story never lets us *feel* him flinch. The moment he informs Anya, a beat that should cost him something, is narrated from outside: “Tears welled in her eyes” instead of his own body registering the emotional tariff. The promised flaw (truth-weaving) never collides with a limits-test; he succeeds without visible internal abrasion, so the arc flattens into competence rather than contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glacier candle → dream shards → melted globe reprise tightens meaning rather than plot. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the warped globe becomes a beacon of love, not ruin—whose conceptual cost (Elias’s life traded for symbol) is legible in the final image. One soft spot: the dream-harvest method is told twice in near-paraphrase, a micro-loop that slightly dulls the last third’s cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glacier shrine is more than postcard: ice walls “gleam like frozen constellations” and candlelight “echoes borrowed starlight,” marrying setting to theme. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its warped glass handled in at least three beats, each time re-pricing the object’s meaning. Spatial choreography stays crisp across dream shards and the final inland visit; no impossible geography or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve a pure relic of love from disaster—remains coherent. Pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each dream shard thickens the globe’s back-story until the final exposure to Anya crystallizes the cost. The tightening is present but gentle; the story opts for lyrical accretion rather than a crucible that forecloses Kaelen’s options, so the felt price is conceptual, not personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: salvageable purity lies not in intact objects but in the deformation wrought by sacrifice. No character articulates this; it surfaces via the globe’s transformation from keepsake to melted beacon. The final altar image re-weights “borrowed starlight” from metaphor to earned resonance, avoiding sermon. Ambiguity remains—Kaelen’s own wreckage is untouched—keeping the moral complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is Kaelen’s (“echoes of the drowned,” “windows of connection”) without head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer dream sentences drift like apnea, then contract for the shrine’s chill. One registral wobble: “conceptual repricing” diction in narration feels academic, momentarily breaking the ghost-whisperer idiom, but recedes quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate and tidal; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“he traveled… he entered the sleep”) create minor scaffold. Figurative density is high yet coherent—starlight, glacier, globe motifs interlock without mixed-metaphor bleed. Information density strong: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers. No line-level artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-whisperer who mines *dream cameos* is a fresh lateral step past standard medium tropes. Melted snow globe as signal beacon repurposes a kitsch object into sacrificial lighthouse, transforming trope through specific maritime desperation. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Risk is present—lyric accumulation over causal thriller—but coherence holds, so the gamble pays off.</comment>
