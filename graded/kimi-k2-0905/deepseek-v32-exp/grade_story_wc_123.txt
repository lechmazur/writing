<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—solitude vs. need for alliance—is dramatized in the final invitation; micro-choice of sharing the bench costs her isolation and is earned by prior pigeon beat. Embodied emotion is light (pulse, steadying hands) but avoids cliché. The woman’s pressure supplies credible external test; “tall figure” memory tag is efficient. Flaw: no visible tool-use or body-failure under stress; competence feels safe, capping at 7.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara forecloses pure solitude by opening the gate, cost legible in “layered tranquility now enriched with alliance.” Causal chain holds: pigeon → data cross-check → alliance offer; each because/therefore tightens options. One transition (dusk-to-night) is legible; orientation anchored by line 3. Minor loop: “layered tranquility” reused three times without reweighting until final line; slight drag, −0.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting: rain gauge, ivy wall, stone bench constrain movement and supply props for beats. Light, coo, cool air—selective sensory triad mirrors internal shift from vigil to alliance. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible pigeon or gate positions. Tool-as-setting test met (gauge, tube) but bench could have pressed flesh harder in final image; caps at 7.9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity of data vs. personal safety—signaled early and tightens when follower reappears; option to flee is foreclosed by her invitation. Agency visible: she chooses to share logs, paying social exposure cost. Escalation driven by her lateral cross-referencing, not luck; coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates, does not resolve. Price paid: loss of solitary sanctuary; visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrity-through-communion emerges from concrete choice rather than assertion; final image reconfigures “layered tranquility” from isolation to shared risk. No moralizing paragraph; resonance carried by pigeon release and gate opening. Subtext in woman’s raised hands conveys plea without pleading. Lacks one sharper ironic gap to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“tempests others ignored,” “pressure dips”—reads weather-observer precise. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for data cross-check, shorter for confrontation. No head-hop; woman’s interior accessed only through Elara’s inference. Filter verbs minimal; “she intuited” is voice-motivated. Dialogue brief, carries subtext (“We need your data”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: rain-gauge adjustment doubles as calm gesture and plot cue. Scaffolding minimal; only “layered tranquility” repeats without early pattern-teaching, minor. Strong verbs (fetch, cross-reference, devise) dominate. No mixed metaphors; weather imagery stays coherent. Final line cadence mirrors dusk-to-night transition effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: storm-data auditor as resistance cell. Rogue-zone weaponizing fake storms is novel extrapolation. Pigeon network feels lived-in, not retro. Transformation test passes—occupation and data obsession are inseparable from plot. Risk-taking modest; structure stays linear safe. Near-echo of “records lied” trope but repurposed through meteorologic proof.</comment>
