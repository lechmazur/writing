<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael’s calm-fisher exterior is vivid, but interiority stays on the surface; the rail-spike trembles read as external cue rather than contradictory impulse. No micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final pin, so the “earned” aspect feels light. The goddess-echo desire is declared early and recurs, yet never collides with a counter-want, keeping motivation single-note. Still, his embodied patience and zig-zag tactics differentiate him from stock archetypes.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captured lullaby stills the constellations, re-weighting the garden’s reality with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world felt whole”). Causal linkage holds—every zig-zag and voicing silence beat tightens options until the final harmonized pin. One soft spot: the rail-spike’s transliteration rules are declared but never tested by failure, so the price feels convenient. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and coherent throughout.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its collapsing sonic petals physically force Kael’s zig-zag path and calibrate the rail-spike’s pulses. Sensory economy is tight—audible ripples, feral lullaby, star-disruption—each detail either constrains movement or charges the final stillness. No visual filler; the garden’s rules are learned only through bodily risk. Micro-setting dominance (spike, echo ribbon) meets the 9+ gate by directly shaping the closing image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the feral echo—is signaled in line 2 and tightens through each sonic collapse; the garden itself supplies escalating pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the constellations’ lurch forces Kael to absorb turbulence via the spike, trading calm for stability. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss (blood, tool fracture) is dramatized, capping intensity just below the 8.5 band. Agency remains steady—every zig-zag and silence voicing is protagonist-driven, not luck.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “harmonize with breakage rather than conquer it,” shown through the final fusion of Kael’s calm and the lullaby’s wildness. No character articulates the thesis; the shift from “feral” to “gentle hum” inside his chest performs the reweighting. Image-pattern—rail spike, zig-zag, voicing silence—returns charged at the end, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Resists moralizing; the reader is left to feel the new balance rather than decode a message.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter: cool, tactile, rhythmic. Synesthetic diction (“audible ripples,” “cold metal comfort”) mirrors his fisher-poet hybrid sensibility. No head-hop; spike-translations are reported as felt vibration, not explained. Compression is purposeful—“voicing silence” is taught by example, not definition—keeping lyric texture legible.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical; sentence rhythm alternates between long breathy clauses and clipped imperative fragments that mimic sonic waves. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances setting, motion, or emotion. Figurative density is high but patterned—garden, lullaby, constellations—so it pays off rather than clutters. Only hairline slip: “patterns began to break themselves” appears twice within 30 words, a minor echo not found in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “sound-wave garden where constellations sleepwalk” is a daringly fresh fantastical frame, yet grounded by Kael’s tactile fisher craft. Zig-zag as tactical philosophy and “voicing silence” as technology feel non-obvious and inseparable from plot. Risk is high—lyric abstraction could have collapsed—but coherence under the Accumulative lens validates the experiment. No recognizable trope templates; the goddess-echo becomes a new myth rather than refurbished folklore.</comment>
