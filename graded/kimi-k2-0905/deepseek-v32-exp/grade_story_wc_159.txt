<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s caretaker identity is embodied through ritualistic tending of glass orchids and the chime-crack crisis, giving her a tactile, lived-in vocation. “Foxglove regret” supplies a distinct emotional flavor, yet interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“her existence was a gently systematic ritual…”) rather than contradiction under pressure; we never see her want anything that might fail. The final beat—returning to the orchids—renders a credible Earned Stasis, but the lack of an opposing want or palpable fear flattens the motivational gradient, keeping the arc competent rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the chime is healed via the forgotten song, restoring the echo-system; cost is felt as “foxglove regret” sharpened by the reminder of humanity’s abandonment. Causal chain is sequential and complete; no teleporting props. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through atmospheric density and pattern repetition rather than because/therefore reversals; this lens is signaled early and held to the final image. Orientation is firm by 60 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Opal library above the clouds” is more than panorama: its fragility directly constrains action—cracked chime threatens collapse, forcing Elara’s archive search. Sensory triangulation (visual opal shimmer, hush of absent wind, tactile trace of crack) is selective and filtered through her caretaker priorities. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly up spiral stairs to spire and back to orchids. The wind chime’s bamboo acts as micro-setting/object that charges the final image when knitted whole by song—meets 9+ gate, but global cap not exceeded elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—preserve echo of forgotten names—is signaled early and escalates as cracked chime endangers the whole archive. Tightening occurs once: discovery that only the lost song can mend the tube narrows options and drives the archive search; cost is conceptual (renewed regret). Agency remains reactive—search, hold tablet, witness repair—rather than a risky choice with forfeiture; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Under Accumulative lens the deepening lands; stronger visceral price would push higher.</comment>

<comment>Theme of custodianship over extinct emotions emerges through repetitive caretaking imagery and the final sealing of the crack, avoiding overt thesis statements. “Museum of extinct feelings” motif reweights at closure: the museum survives but its keeper’s regret intensifies, offering Charged Poise. Subtext operates in silence—no human encounter, only relics—yet insight is slightly abstract (“reminder of all that humanity had left behind”). No moralizing paragraph; resonance is present but could cut deeper with one grounded, personal loss exemplified.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“glass orchids,” “opal tablets,” “frozen milk sea”—creates a perfumed, antiquarian register consistent with her archivist calling. Rhythm waxes lyrical yet varies: longer cadences for ascent, brittle fragments (“crack began to shimmer”) at climax, mirroring tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal syntax remains coherent under pressure. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but overwritten streaks persist: stacked epithets (“shimmering, opalescent codexes,” “translucent petal”) appear in successive sentences without pattern-teaching, diluting urgency. Metaphors mostly cohere yet one mixed image (“clouds below resembled a sea of frozen milk”) slightly jars physical logic. No template cadence or paraphrase loops, and high information density is maintained. Artifacts do not touch closure, but the ornamental flourish keeps it from highest band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating library of fossilized emotions preserved by resonant chimes—offers a fresh synthesis of memory-archive and ethereal architecture tropes. Emotional stakes hinge on forgotten names rather than world-saving MacGuffin, resisting scale inflation. Transmutation test passes: caretaker ritual, bamboo fracture, and foxglove regret are inseparable from this invented cosmology. Risk in lyric world-building pays off without clarity loss, earning the upper tier.</comment>
