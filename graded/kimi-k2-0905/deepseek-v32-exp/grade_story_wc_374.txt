<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior skepticism is concrete—her glow intensifies with doubt, a vivid physicalization. The taste-based compass use gives her a sensory, embodied decision path. Yet her moment of “realization” at the end is stated, not dramatized: “She realized her luminosity was not just skepticism…” lands as an abstract epiphany rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything. Because the climactic internal shift is summarized, not performed, the arc feels slightly under-cooked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The story teaches its speculative rules early and cleanly: compass tastes, weather-carriers, forest elections. Causality holds: each compass quiver prompts her downhill, the man’s explanation retroactively justifies the anomaly, and the final hum/aurora flare is a satisfying CR that reweights the premise. Cost is present but diffuse—mostly conceptual—so the closure grazes rather than punches. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) remains coherent and the ending image lands.</comment>

<comment> Lavender scent thickens as she descends, anchoring altitude change in smell; the compass ring’s cool/warm pulses act as micro-setting that constrains direction. The aurora and electoral hum provide a terrestrially cosmic scale without catalogue bloat. Spatial choreography is flawless: bluff → valley → tree line meeting. Only the man’s “weather-worn face” drifts toward cliché; otherwise sensory picks are character-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why people carry weather—surfaces in paragraph 1 and tightens when the compass needle steadies on the man. The single deepening (his revelation that carriers are anchors) forecloses Elara’s skepticism and reweights her glow; the cost is epistemic rather than visceral. No visible price is extracted from her beyond conceptual shift, keeping pressure in the conceptual register. Adequate for this length and lens, but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: individual emotion ↔ planetary climate, democracy of woods ↔ democracy of selves. No moralizing summary; the aurora flare acts as non-literal answer. The nostalgic ache is subtly earned: “a pang of nostalgia… when weather was just weather” reframes her earlier skepticism as loss. Complex without confusion; tidy neither in sentiment nor message.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Lexicon is restrained—no poetic overreach—and syntax modulates with terrain: shorter clauses on descent, longer cadenced lines under aurora. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: man’s “You feel it too, don’t you?” implies shared election pressure. Filter verbs are few; occasional faint therapeutical tinge (“her skepticism was a core part of her luminosity”) is the lone blemish.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “fragrant blanket over the bluff” does double duty (smell + tactility). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances position, texture, or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—ozone taste, compass pulse—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Opening and final lines are ear-tested and cadence-matched. Minor: “weather-worn face” is a stock phrase, but it occupies only two words and does not recur.</comment>

<comment>The weather-carrier concept feels fresh because it’s tied to planetary homeostasis rather than superhero trope. Forest elections as root-level democracy, tasted via air, is an original cosmological frame. Synthesis of climate science, animist politics, and sensory navigation is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present—lyric elliptical exposition—but coherence holds, so the gamble pays off.</comment>
