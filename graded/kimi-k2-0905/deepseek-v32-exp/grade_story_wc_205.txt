<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “burnished sorrow” and failed-revolutionary backstory give her a believable interior contradiction, but the text tells us her motives more than it dramatizes them under pressure; only one micro-choice—uncovering the mirror—carries visible cost, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The closure (crystal shard projecting holograms) lands as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the past, but the causal chain is fuzzy: we aren’t shown why storm + shard + mirror = vision, only that it does; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern is taught, yet the missing mechanism keeps the cost intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Baroque asteroid” and golden time-strands are vivid, selective, and quickly anchored; the shard-as-micro-setting reappears to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, while mirror-covering ritual integrates with cultural logic, though spatial choreography inside the study is skimmed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—prove the civilization were poets—tightens once when Kael scoffs, but the experimental beat lacks external obstruction after that; escalation is mostly descriptor-driven (“dispute intensified”) rather than option-narrowing, so the cost feels announced, not tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise that history is poetry; the final image of shard-glow reframes “burnished sorrow” without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit, but the abstract dispute dominates over embodied stakes, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays stable; diction (“poetically inclined,” “burnished sorrow”) is textured yet consistent. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but perceptual signature—time as visible threads—remains character-specific and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence and varied sentence openings, yet a run of participial phrases plus three “burnished” repetitions edges toward template. No mixed metaphors, but slight scaffold in storm descriptions keeps it shy of 7+ polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Visible time + mirror-covering poetry culture is a fresh synthesis; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact speculative rules. Risk heightens thematic stakes without clarity loss, earning the +0.3 ingenuity bump.</comment>
