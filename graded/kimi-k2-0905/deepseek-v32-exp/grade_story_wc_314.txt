<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—analytical rigor versus wonder—are dramatized in the crystal-warming beat, but the interiority drifts toward self-explanatory loft (“she knew…”) rather than raw contradiction under fire; still, the earned poise at the end carries visible cost and reconciles the split.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via prismatic sensory layering and holds through the final image; the Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the liquefied crystal re-colors the orchard, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—no causal zigzag needed for this lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice—fire distance, hand tremor, thaw rate—while the kaleidoscopic waterfall supplies ever-shifting light that charges the final image; specificity is economical yet omnipresent, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Pressure tightens once: the flame must warm but not shatter the crystal—this single, visible trade-off narrows options and forces the stance crystallization; the cost is the crystal’s extinction and the irreversible internal shift, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the starling pattern reweights from metaphor to lived method, letting “harmony” arrive as sensory image rather than thesis; the refusal to moralize preserves ambiguity, though the grandmother line flirts with echo-heavy articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays fixed at Elara’s shoulder; perceptual signature filters every noun through alchemical lexicon (“prismatic light,” “liquid shimmer”) yet keeps diction within her trained gaze; rhythmic control peaks in the crystal-glow cadence without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to staccato flame beats; only minor scaffold (“the hidden waterfall whispered…/the orchard stood silent…”) repeats subject-opening, but density remains high and no mixed metaphors mar the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar alchemical trope is refreshed through starling synchronicity as practical method rather than decoration; the dew-crystal-as-thermostat is an inventive constraint, yet the grandmother voice and orchard sanctuary feel inherited; overall, a strong synthesis rather than a leap.</comment>
