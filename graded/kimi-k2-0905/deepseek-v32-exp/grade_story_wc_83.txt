<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s grief is rendered with visceral, embodied specificity; his “hunt” is never abstract. Micro-choices are few but strategic: placing the geode, initiating the pulse, enduring the blackout. One flaw: plateauing rather than deepening—after the overload he is merely “unmoving,” not shown re-weighing options. Still, the renunciation of the search is legible and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens is explicit and airtight: geode-pulse → interference loop → blackout → final knowing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before the 120-word mark in the first paragraph. The Decisive Change is the blackout-borne epiphany; cost is the simultaneous “devastating emptiness.” Closure reweights the premise so that loss is re-termed “unchangeable structure.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observatory, breaker countdown, and geode cradle are handled as tactile instruments, never postcard backdrop. Micro-setting dominates—body, tool, and console constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Kaelen’s engineering mindset: hum, sparks, absolute blackness. Final image of cold star-language is charged by the earlier telescope dormancy, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single, clear stake: find the “pools of unused potential.” Tightening occurs when the feedback loop forecloses the search; cost is the overload and permanent emotional renunciation. Agency remains on-page—he engineers the pulse and suffers its price. No coincidence, no abstract escalation—pressure is entirely causal and culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief is not a missing object but the shadow cast by love’s permanent quantum presence. No thesis statements—only images (echo of child’s laughter, dark geode, cold stars). The final image re-prices the hunt itself, turning potential from “pools” to lived structure. Ambiguity lingers: is the knowledge consoling or crushing? Answer is unstated yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, scientific, slightly lyrical—matching a widowed astro-engineer’s mind. Diction stays inside plausible lexicon (“perturbation,” “quantum foam”) without jargon dump. Rhythm accelerates into the overload, then fractures into staccato clauses mirroring blown breakers. No filter-verb clutter; perception is selective and biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; information density is high yet clear. Figurative language is spare, purposeful: “ghost haunting a machine,” “bloom of fire.” No overwriting in peak blackout beat—language turns blunt and declarative to mirror the unfiltered knowing. Final line lands with imagistic snap and echoes opening silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses quantum grief-hunt with hard-science observatory—fresh synthesis. Risk: using “love as quantum constant” could have slid into pseudo-profundity, but emotional particulars anchor it. Geode-as-resonator transforms sentimental keepsake into functional tool. Final re-pricing feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
