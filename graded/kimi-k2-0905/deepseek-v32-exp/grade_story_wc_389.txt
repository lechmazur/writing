<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—she reads the “rivulets of rain on the cobalt glass portico” as prophecy, not décor. The “lyrically prophetic” voice is consistent and character-bound, and her descent is driven by a micro-choice: the clear unity broadcast that overturns her exile. Cost is visible—she forfeits her sky-guarded solitude and trades it for muddy politics—yet the “ancient shadows” she wields are asserted more than dramatized, blunting flaw-to-choice linkage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm-static and radio crackle accrete until the cobalt canopy reprise reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara on the crowd’s edge, sky washed clean, cost legible in her “quiet hope” and forfeited tower. Causality is clean: the unity broadcast triggers descent; betrayal threat tightens council stakes; final canopy homage crystallizes options. One scaffold loop—“the rise of the prophet was complete, but her work…was just beginning”—is forgivable at the coda.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is more postcard than constraint until Elara repurposes its cobalt glass as a portable canopy—then the setting materially shapes the final diplomacy beat. Rain-slick glass and static hiss are filtered through her tuner-brain; every sensory note is selective and urgent. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the cloud-to-ground transition; weather remains a live pressure, not backdrop. The micro-setting (portable canopy) satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara turn static whispers into a unified rebellion without losing herself? Pressure tightens once: the unity broadcast forces her off the tower—option foreclosed. Variant allegiance fracturing supplies credible antagonistic pressure; betrayal rumble keeps cost visible. Escalation is textural—radio song reinterpreted live—rather than causal-reversal, sufficient for the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between signal and noise—ancient shadows repurposed for new dawn—without moralizing. The cobalt glass reprise and “whisper of reconciliation across the airwaves” reweight prior static into resonance. Subtext lives in gesture: Elara smiles “from the edge of the crowd,” neither martyr nor monarch. Only tick is the near-thesis line “prophet rises not from a crown, but from a crackle,” softened by its early placement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable, storm-tuned: “static hiss of a forgotten era,” “cerulean ghosts on the floor.” Syntax coils and releases in step with her descent—long, rain-run sentences aloft, shorter beats on the ground. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains hers. Dialogue is absent by design, so the portico and radio serve as speaking partners—risky but coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate, oceanic—paragraph swells mirror cloud-storms, then tighten on mud and crowd. Figurative layer is thick yet purposive; mixed-metaphor risk is low because vehicles (glass, crackle, storm) share an atmospheric physics. One paraphrase loop at coda noted in Q2; otherwise information density stays high. Filter verbs rare; verbs are strong: “she dissolved the last barriers,” “sky washed clean.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The radio-prophet mosaic feels fresh—signal-hunter becomes king-maker via ancient static. Cobalt portico repurposed as rebel canopy is an inventive pivot that grows from earlier image. Variant allegiance trope is grounded in live council debate, not abstract factions. Risk distinction +0.3 for making a lyric, almost solitaire narrator the engine of mass politics without lapsing into allegory.</comment>
