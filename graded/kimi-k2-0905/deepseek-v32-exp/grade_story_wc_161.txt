<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s guarded interiority and incremental trust are credibly embodied; the moment she “broke down” still reads summary rather than scene, muting the cost of her confession. Micro-choices under pressure (encoding songs, handing over the chip) are present but spaced thinly across the montage, so the hierarchy of values feels declared more than dramatized. The pigeons and chip act as externalized organs of motive, keeping the arc legible, yet the emotional peak is paraphrased, not lived at sentence level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic becomes sanctuary, songs are released, and trust is chosen—cost is the exposure of her invented past and the irrevocable launch of the encoded pigeons. Causal drive holds: each return visit tightens Leo’s access to truth and Elara’s willingness to yield it. However, the letter discovery is an off-stage convenience that slightly dilutes the agency of the final beat; the ending still reweights meaning under the skylight image, keeping the lens coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s skylight-etched dust, meteorite chip, and paper strata are used as tactile instruments of balance and memory; they physically constrain how Elara calms herself and how the songs are stored. Sensory economy is disciplined—smell of paper, swirl of motes—each detail tied to her perceptual filter rather than catalogued. Micro-setting (chip as cipher, dust as map) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, though the exterior city remains a blur, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving vanished songs while risking self-exposure—arrives early and tightens through each pigeon flight and Leo’s probing kindness. The meaningful turn is the chip decryption choice that forecloses her isolation; cost is the surrender of her curated story. Escalation is accumulative rather than sharply reversive; coincidence (the letter) nudges rather than resolves, keeping pressure coherent under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection-through-fragility (songs, trust, dust) emerges from the recurring attic images rather than overt statement. The meteorite’s reweighting—from private talisman to public decoder—provides a crisp conceptual repricing that resonates without moralizing. Subtext of invented identities as survival tools is legible, though the final beat flirts with an articulated thesis (“every ending holds the seed…”) that slightly blunts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice stays in close third with consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices dust spirals, paper ghosts, pigeon muscle tension. Syntax flexes appropriately—long breathless sentences when she maps motes, shorter fragments under betrayal memory. No dialogue is required; internal monologue avoids filter verbs and retains idiom distinct from Leo’s off-page speech. A single late intrusion of proverb-like closure risks committee voice, but the bulk sustains character-particular diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: lines advance atmosphere plus motive simultaneously (“each flight a thread in the web”). Figurative language is selective—dust as constellation, songs as echo—without crowding high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; paragraph breaks track emotional breath. Opening and closing sentences anchor and recharge the dust/skylight motif, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusing Martian meteorite micro-engravings with carrier-pigeon song-preservation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable once revealed. The “blooming withering” tone is handled through decay-to-sanctuary attic transformation rather than declared dichotomy. Risk is moderate—lyric montage over scene—but particulars (chip decryption, dust mapping) keep it from sliding into template. Derivative notes are minor; the cultural-vanishing angle could apply to any lost heritage, yet the chosen implements are idiosyncratic enough to resist swap-out.</comment>
