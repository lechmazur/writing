<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coachman’s motive—gardening the battlefield—stays clear, but his interiority lists rather than embodies; “he thought” and “he remembered” keep emotion at arm’s length. Micro-choices (crushing pods, scattering) are present yet fail to reveal fresh contradiction; the same calm gentleness repeats beat-to-beat, so pressure never complicates his stance. No flaw or blind spot surfaces, so the ending feels inevitable, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each seed sown and bird call layers density until the jetty’s glow reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—garden launched, concord felt—but cost is only asserted (“battlefield erased”) not dramatized; no tangible price touches the coachman. Orientation is anchored by line 5, transitions are smooth, yet the single forward motion is incremental, not tightened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Blooming jetty at twilight” is vividly particular: salt-laced dusk, glowing alien flowers, stone finger against black ocean. Sensory choice is POV-driven—he listens, kneels, handles pods—so setting evolves through动作. The reef’s silence and barren shore contrast the new blooms, charging the final image; environment steers where seeds will take. Micro-setting (pod powder, rail-perched birds) constrains the sowing tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—signals early, but pressure is static: every beat repeats the same gentle success. No resource shortage, opposition, or inner doubt complicates sowing; options do not narrow. Escalation is purely lyrical accumulation; under Accumulative lens that suffices, yet the lack of visible cost keeps tension flat. Closure reweights meaning but not tactical risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing via cross-species alliance emerges organically from pod-crushing and avian translation; no axiom is stated. “Submerged concord” ripens from abstract idea to felt atmosphere, reconfiguring war memory without sermon. Final image reprises narrow vastness, letting peace feel both fragile and immense. Complexity is present: no verdict that gardens end all wars—just this patch, tonight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained, incantatory, with archaic diction and cadenced repetition that matches dead-language speaker. Perceptual signature filters every sight through soil-ear: “rattling like a tiny promise,” “narrow vastness.” Compression and ellision are taught early (“gloom-hill coachman,” “submerged concord”) and stay legible. No head-hop, no register drift; syntax breathes with twilight solemnity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lines are musical, scaffold-free, with varied sentence shapes and strong verbs (“crushed,” “scattered,” “hummed”). Occasional poetic abstractions (“concord felt tangible”) slight loss of sensory edge, but never muddy causality. No loops, no mixed metaphors; information dual-loaded via bird-call soil readings. Final clause concord “melody of balance returned” risks soft abstraction yet lands within lyric contract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—battlefield garden seeded by bird-guided, dead-language ritual—is fresh synthesis of eco-fantasy with memorial lyric. Tropes (twilight shore, silent reef) are re-fleshed through tactile sowing ritual. Risk is present but moderate; template cadence creeps in repeated “after the reef dies” refrain. Specificity of pod-rattle and bird-code keeps it from feeling generic; still, emotional arc could belong to any mournful healer.</comment>
