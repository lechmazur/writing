<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “brazen calm” is consistently embodied in her steady hands, unhurried documentation, and whispered negotiations with stone; the diary functions as an extension of her mind, grounding every micro-choice. Interior contradiction is minimal—her serenity never cracks, so the arc is less about change than about enduring stance, which the text renders as credible renunciation. The copper ritual is the only visible tactic; its repetitions risk procedural flattening, yet each loop tightens the lattice of costless time she spends. Cost is conceptual—her life, not the orchard—so the emotional price feels abstract, keeping her just shy of the 9-band where embodied flaw and felt loss must coalesce.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the intertwined sketch reconfigures the orchard into a perpetual dialogue that outlives her; the cost is the unspoken forfeiture of any other farewell. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper-wound oak thickens the pattern until the crystalline veins answer back, a visible density shift rather than causal reversal. Orientation is anchored within the first 100 words—Kaelen, caretaker, terminal countdown—so no penalty applies. The diary’s “footnote” is the single exposed exposition patch, but it triggers the entire tactic chain, so causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The temple orchard is not backdrop but actor: the pillars’ slow hum and crystalline veins literally grow the interface Elara seeks. Copper glints, sap scents, and stone warmth are filtered through her caretaker gaze—practical, reverent, measured—so every sensory pick serves the remodel goal. Spatial choreography stays crisp: she begins at center, spirals outward, and the stag’s final bow occurs at a pillar she wired weeks earlier. The “living stone” premise is bold; its biological impossibility is left uncued, but because the story commits early and uses it to constrain choices, it passes the plausibility bar under lyrical rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecience before death—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens only once: the stag’s bow proves the dialogue real, foreclosing skepticism. Elara’s agency is entirely in the copper ritual; no external obstacle pushes back, so escalation is a steady accumulation of responsive phenomena rather than rising threat. Cost is conceptual—her life—but because the orchard’s awakening is smooth, the price feels external rather than wrested from her on the page. Still, under Accumulative lens, the density of cross-species gestures (birds nesting, mammals listening, stag bowing) meaningfully reweights the stake, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: respect is something one grows like bark over wire, a slow fusion of foreign tissues. The copper-and-oak motif stays particular—never slides into cheap eco-allegory—and the final sketch replaces moral with image. Ambiguity is productive: the orchard will outlast her, yet the reader must decide whether that offsets one human death. The diary’s “architectural secrets” risk a whisper of meta-commentary, but because the secret is enacted rather than declared, thematic drift is avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: sentences lengthen and soften under her calm, compress only when she cinches wire. No head-hopping; the stag’s bow is observed, not interiorized. Diction stays within caretaker lexicon—supple, lattice, conduit—avoiding scientific jargon or poetic overdose. Rhythm mirrors her systematic hand: parallel “she would…” clauses early, then shorter observational fragments as creatures respond, a quiet sonic braid that pays off in the hushed final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Almost no scaffold: each sentence adds new physical information or creature reaction. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—“sleeping giants” for pillars, “lattice for potential” for copper—never stacked. One paraphrase risk: “not a cage of confinement, but a lattice for potential” restates negatively then positively, but the second half introduces the key term “potential,” so it earns its keep. Final paragraph avoids sentimental cadence; the single sketch replaces explanatory summary, keeping closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The grown-stone conduit premise is fresh, yet the copper-wire arbor-sculpture tactic has prior art in real-world tree-shaping; the synthesis with sentient geology feels new. The “six-month terminal” frame is familiar, but here it’s used to justify a stance rather than a bucket list, a quiet inversion. Risk is present—non-sentient stone responding could break reader trust—but the piece teaches the rule early and follows it, so gamble pays off. Transformation test fails: swap copper for bronze and the plot still works, capping originality just below the 9-tier where every detail must feel inevitable.</comment>
