<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—collector of measurable scent seeking the immeasurable—drives every beat; the compass relinquishment is a believable, costly renunciation. Psychometry micro-choices (“wave … clarity”) visibly tilt her stance toward surrender. Flaw: the factory-silence cue is used twice for the same emotional beat, a minor redundancy that keeps her from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: compass offered, lagoon reweighted, cost legible in “resonant hush” that now holds her. Accumulative lens holds: petrichor motif intensifies from bottled scent to lived presence; the final image reprises “hush” first heard at the cave lip, proving pattern coherence. No teleporting props or causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone dome and obsidian water are not postcard garnish—they narrow her options (no vials, no north). Compass-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its needle spins toward water. Sensory hierarchy obeys her vocation: scent > sight > sound. One hairline slip: “granite-quarry factory” reads as tell; a sensory cue would have nailed 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where explanations fail”—tightens once, when the compass psychometry flips her from capture to surrender. Cost is paid on-page: she forfeits both tool and vocation’s premise. Pressure accretes via accumulative texture; no reversal needed. The hush itself becomes the final antagonist that forecloses extraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges unstated: measurement vs. mystery. The lagoon’s “impossible stillness” reprises the factory’s mechanical silence, forcing her vocation to collapse into experience. No moralizing; final image answers the thematic question by refusing to name it. Hairline deduction for the echoing “hush” tag applied twice in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is filtered through scent-oriented perception (“promise of petrichor growing stronger”). Syntax lengthens underwater, contracts on stone—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays mid-close. One clause drifts into textbook diction: “conceptual repricing” territory in “explanations failed”—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors. High density: “mechanical groans faded” does scenery, time, and social context in five syllables. Paragraph cuts are surgical—removing any sentence would collapse atmosphere or causality. Final line’s monosyllabic cadence (“collection in itself”) lands the quiet charge cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>“Petrichor collector” is transformed from quirky label to epistemic stance; vocation becomes the very instrument that must be relinquished. Compass-as-psychometric key feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk: choosing stillness over discovery in a genre that usually rewards revelation; coherence stays intact.</comment>
