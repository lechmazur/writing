<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the silence felt heavier than any duty”), his flaw-clouded judgment is dramatized through the portal walk-through of past failures, and the final renunciation of old duty is micro-choices-driven. Still, the sole on-page character limits relational crucible tests, and the self-forgiveness arc edges toward tidy calibration, capping the upper band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the driftwood trail and lighter flute reweight meaning with felt cost, under an Accumulative/Textural lens where silence and markers accrue. Orientation is anchored by word 50, causality is clean, and the single portal transition is legible. The absence of an externalized constraint beyond self-judgment keeps it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are filtered through Kael’s guilt-drained perception; each sensory pick is selective (avalanche-quiet, bleached driftwood) and the driftwood micro-setting literally constrains his return path. The final image recharges the same environment as sanctuary rather than prison, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—is signaled early and tightened when ghost-replays force observation under avalanching silence. Agency is interior but visible: arranging markers before playing, choosing to watch not flinch. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence about his error) rather than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: failure as instructor, silence as classroom. The driftwood-to-flute recurrence reweights meaning at closure; no moralizing occurs. Subtext resides in gesture—uncasing, marking, re-casing—creating quiet resonance, though the conceptual cost is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; prose rhythm modulates from long guilt-laden sentences to clipped marker placements. Metaphors (“light bent like liquid”) stay within Kael’s plausible awe. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature, which is sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets mood, anchors body, advances action. No scaffold loops; metaphors are clean and non-contradictory. Occasional elevated diction (“otherwhere”) is motivated by world-walking awe. Clarity at closure is pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Portal-through-silence flute is a fresh synthesis of familiar relic and liminal travel tropes; driftwood breadcrumb trail is a humble, specific innovation. Transformation test passes: Kael’s remade stance is inseparable from this canyon and this artifact. Risk is modest, yielding mid-7 baseline.</comment>
