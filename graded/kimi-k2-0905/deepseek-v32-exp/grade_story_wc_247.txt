<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s forgotten loneliness is embodied in the weightless camera; his micro-choice to aim it at moonlit water crystallizes a believable shift from passive ache to active listener. The advisor remains a cipher—graceful hands, lunar eyes—lacking interior contradiction or visible cost, so the relationship never becomes a true crucible. Still, Elian’s final confident signing and the felt cost of the advisor’s disappearance earn a scaled, credible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian departs carrying the retooled camera and an internalized “silent sonata,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each mapped silence adds density until the dawn fade reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. The advisor’s unexplained arrival/departure is accepted by the lyric pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, lapping pilings, and salt-sigh breeze are filtered through Elian’s lonely attention, guiding his choice to “compose the void.” The camera-as-frame and the dock’s spatial logic remain coherent; bodies track cleanly. While the wider world is sketched, the micro-setting of dock, tide, and lens constrains the final perceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elian remain unheard—is signaled early and tightens as each mapped silence forecloses total isolation without removing the cost of being forgotten. Agency is perceptual rather than external, sufficient under Accumulative lens. One deepening: the transfer of the camera makes Elian the mapper, narrowing options. Cost is legible yet quiet; a sharper tangible loss would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—silence as generative music—emerges through gesture and moonlit water rather than thesis. The joyful sorrow tone modulates from ache to luminous acceptance without moralizing. Final image of Elian leaving with “timeless harmony” reweights prior neglect via earned particulars. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers about who else will ever hear the music.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elian’s selective perception; diction (“liquid silver,” “sorrowful violin”) mirrors his heightened receptivity. Syntax breathes with harbor rhythms, no drumbeat patterns. Sign-language passages are cleanly rendered in italics-free description, maintaining immediacy. Voice never leaks into advisor interiority, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical: varied sentence lengths, strong verbs, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—each metaphor (camera as “vessel of perception”) returns reweighted. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Opening line anchors stakes; final line releases image without over-explaining. Minor opportunity: one “gleaming like liquid silver” is familiar phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—translating silence into music via sign-language cartography—feels fresh and specific to this moonlit dock. Risk lies in the advisor’s unexplained ontology, but the lyric pattern taught early makes the choice coherent. Emotional specificity of forgotten loneliness prevents swap-with-anywhere effect. Final reconfiguration of the filmless camera into perceptual instrument is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
