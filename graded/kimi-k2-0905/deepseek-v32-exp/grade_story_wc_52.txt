<comment>The widow’s interiority is vivid—grief rendered as bodily precision “hands steady despite the tremor in her soul.” The contradiction between practical carving and raw ache acts in-scene, not summary. One flaw: “harvest lessons from loss” drifts into self-help register in the final paragraph, slightly diluting the earned grit.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished lion head crystallizes time and reconciles here/gone with visible cost—she sets the piece aside “her heart a little lighter” yet the loft still rains. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving accumulates meaning until the final image reweights the stake. The kettle’s whistle is the taught pattern that pays off as timer and pressure release. No orientation or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges every beat—light shifts from “soft diffuse glow” to “rust-hued peace,” mirroring internal shift. Ash wood grain becomes tactile map of memory; wet scent permeates action. Tool and body substitute for broader geography, constraining choice to the carving bench. Meets 9+ gate: loft environment + tool + weather jointly shape tempo and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fear of forgetting—tightens as kettle whistle shortens temporal runway. Escalation is textural: each shaving ups the stakes by narrowing the blank’s future; the final stroke forecloses further revision. Cost is legible: she trades boiling water (immediate life) for finished carving, accepting perpetual absence. Slight reserve: external pressure is ambient, not antagonistic; could wish for one sharper material consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: containment vs. wildness, memory vs. erasure. “Crystallized time” reframes grief as artifact, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of lion head in ash reweights earlier “here and gone” without moralizing. Only minor echo of prompt language in “harvest lessons” line, but resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile—grain, hiss, whistle, rust light. Syntax mirrors carving rhythm: short clauses, controlled pauses. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within widow’s lived lexicon. Voice modulates from taut restraint to release without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer weather, tool, emotion. No paraphrase loops; each repetition (“here and gone,” “crystallized time”) accrues new nuance. Metaphors are concrete—“rust-hued peace” anchors color to decay. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar widow-grief trope is refreshed through craft metaphor: carving as memory-taming lions. “Crystallized time” offers non-obvious synthesis of clock and wood. Risk lies in compressed single-scene timer; payoff justifies gamble. Could push further—lion tamer lore remains offstage—but specificity of ash grain keeps it memorable.</comment>
