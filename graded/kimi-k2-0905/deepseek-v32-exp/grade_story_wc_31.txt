<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to see sound while anchored to a repetitive job—remains vivid; the moment he pockets the key and chooses to dive is a micro-choice that actually costs him safety and forecloses the quiet life. Embodied emotion is strong: “his heart, once quiet, now beat in rhythm with the luminous vows.” Flaws (obsessive solitude, risk-prone curiosity) actively complicate the dive; the final renunciation—returning to the pier but seeing color in every flame—shows Earned Stasis with cost (he can never un-see, never stop wandering). No stock label-speak; voice stays specific to a night-working man who trusts his eyes and hands.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: lantern release → key find → dive → orb melody → color synesthesia; each because/therefore tightens options until the final silent vow. Orientation anchors cleanly inside 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last paragraph re-prices his lamplighting from job to priesthood, with conceptual cost—he is now “keeper of sensory truths,” a life-sentence. Persistent constraint (color in every flame) is visible in the final image; lens stays Causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Sensory economy is superb: “meteor hush” and “gas lamps push back darkness” filter through a man who works by smell of salt and creak of planks. The sunken-library micro-setting constrains the climax—air pocket, waterlogged shelves, stone pedestal—all tactile, no tour-guide lists. Recurrent lantern light refracts through water onto library walls, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: row, dive, surface inside hull, orb drawer opens without impossible motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—see the color of sound—signaled in first paragraph; pressure tightens once: the key appears, forcing the dive that could drown him. Cost is visible when he surfaces in the decaying library, lungs burning, choice irreversible. The orb’s price is legible: once seen, the colored flames can never be unseen—live constraint established in final paragraph. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—perception as vocation—emerges through images, never stated: lamplighter becomes synesthetic priest. Recurrent lantern motif shifts from festival decoration to inner vision, re-weighted at closure. Subtext in silence: the meteor hush is the unspoken contract that he will serve beauty alone. Final image offers Charged Poise: colored flames dancing above black water, non-literal answer to “what is the color of sound?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is tactile, occupational: he notices wicks, glints, creaks, never abstract color-theory jargon. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for glide across water, staccato clauses for dive sequence. No head-hopping; diction remains within a working man’s lexicon except for the lyrical lift at climax, justified by awe. Dialogue absent; narration sings alone without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers job-detail, atmosphere, and foreshadowing (“their ascent painted the air with a meteor hush”). Figurative language is sparse, precise; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image. Tense stable; no typos. Prop tracking clean—key tag, orb, rowboat all handled on-page.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia quest + sunken library + gas-lit pier festival feels inevitable, not stitched. Lantern-as-sound-pixel is a non-obvious metaphor that grows from lamplighter craft. Risk taken: quiet lyric ending instead of rescue-drama, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if names changed—this could only happen to a night-worker who tends naked flames.</comment>
