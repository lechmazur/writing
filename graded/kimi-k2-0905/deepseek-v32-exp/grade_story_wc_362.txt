<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt surfaces through embodied memory rather than confession. The micro-choice to keep walking after seeing her own complicity lands with visible cost. However, the friend-abandonment backstory is asserted in one retrospective sentence; dramatizing a flash or sensory cue would have raised the score. Still, the hierarchy of values (truth > self-image) is legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The story teaches its accumulative pattern early—each frost vision layers residue—then tightens into the self-portrait reveal that reweights the premise. The closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s new emotional mass is felt without exposition. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image crystallizes options rather than resolving plot. One minor scaffold: “shifted hush” is named three times in 80 words near the open; trimming one would polish.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quartz arbor and frost-car function as micro-settings that constrain method and revelation. Mist proximity dictates the slow reveal; frost patterns are tactile gateways, not backdrop. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s mystic filter—she notices refraction angles, not license plates. The prism’s weight change in her pocket at the end is a perfect environmental echo of internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving emotional residue—tightens when the residue turns out to be hers. The reversal (witness → source) narrows future options: she can no longer pose as detached observer. Cost is visible in the heavier prism and slowed gait. Escalation is single but sufficient for this length; a second external obstacle would have over-crowded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: the instruments we build to expose others record ourselves. Subtext lives in the frost portraits—each stranger’s joy foreshadows her shame. Final image avoids moralizing; the clearing window implies ongoing exposure. One hairline slip: “truthful lies” is voiced twice; letting the paradox stay implicit would sharpen trust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s mystic perceptual signature—light fractures, breath crystallizes. Syntax lengthens during communion, then fragments when guilt hits (“A shifted hush fell”). No head-hopping; the arbor stays external. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and motivated by mystic practice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with discovery—long sentences for layering visions, staccato for the blow. No loops; each frost image adds new information. Figurative control: “crystalline structures rose like trees” is the only simile, earned by setting. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line resolves by image (“she had found what she sought”) without canned uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The object-emotion premise is familiar; the inversion that the scientist’s own shame is the final dataset feels fresh and inevitable. Frost on a junked car as emotional archive is a lovely, grounded twist on psychometry tropes. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric close rather than spectacle—but coherence justifies it. Could push further if the prism’s refraction geometry later mirrored her self-accusation angle.</comment>
