<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—cosmic attunement versus noise overload—stays active in scene; the moment she “adjusted the orrery” and feels stardust awaken is a visible micro-choice that forecloses silence forever. The single cost is felt: once music pours out, the threat of returning silence is named, not just declared. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays coherent. Voice refrain “shadowed rapture” risks label-speak, but embodied aurora & orrery chill keep it from therapy register.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: stardust→aurora→orrery pattern layers density until the final cadence shift (“In rest, she found endless motion”). Closure is Charged Poise: options re-weighted—she will keep vigil, silence forever stalks her songs—cost is cosmic and unmistakable. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no penalty. No causality gaps; each meteor trace tightens the pattern rather than triggers plot turns, fitting the lyric design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass orrery, aurora-lit archway, and remembered stardust are not backdrop but choice-constraining tools: the orrery’s gears limit finger placement, the archway’s open sky forces exposure, stardust memory dictates composition notes. Final image recharges all three—orrery rest in hands, aurora above, stardust awake—so the micro-setting directly shapes the ending. Sensory economy favors cold metal & green light over visual catalog. No spatial drift; bodies stay centered under the stone arch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence vs. song—signaled in second paragraph; pressure mounts via meteor density & aurora brightness rather than external antagonist. One deepening: “true rest…would come only from harmony” narrows options from escape to alignment. Cost is legible: perpetual vigilance against returning silence. No reversal, but lyric intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; the final cadence makes the stakes lifelong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern—stardust/orrery/aurora—never sermonizes; final line “creativity, like stardust, is eternal” is spoken by the cosmos, not the narrator, avoiding thematic echo penalty. Ambiguity lingers: rest is motion, rapture is shadowed. No tidy moral; the price is endless vigil. Image reweighting is non-literal and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Moonstruck dreamer diction—“velvety darkness,” “remembered stardust”—stays within lyric register without purple overload; rhythm modulates: longer coils during aurora sweats, clipped fragments at star-strike. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Patterned repetition of “shadowed rapture” is taught early and paid off in final paragraph, earning its keep. Psychic distance stays tight inside Elara’s perceptions; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “She adjusted the orrery, the remembered stardust within her seemed to awaken” advances plot and reifies metaphor. Rhythm breathes with white-space paragraph breaks that mimic meteor arcs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line crystallizes motion-within-rest. Minor risk: “shadowed rapture” could drift toward cliché, but context keeps it fresh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines synesthesia-astronomy with creative block is familiar, but the orrery-as-metronome and aurora-lit archway as concert hall feel particular. Stardust memory as compositional DNA is a fresh inflection. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight—every meteor trace prefigures note order. Risk is medium; reward is high because lyric structure commits fully.</comment>
