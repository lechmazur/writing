<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with the Library is credibly anchored to the letter and the watch; her disciplined note-taking under reversal stress shows embodied resolve. Interiority is mostly concrete (“calculating the next move through ever-shifting paths”) but occasionally drifts into abstract labels (“cautious exuberance” repeated). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the veil functions as filter, not flaw. The final stilling of the watch supplies visible, earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the entrance shimmer threatens erasure, Elara recalibrates via her own echo, and the library admits her—Charged Poise with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each propagation-delay measurement directly toggles her position relative to the reversing cipher. One soft patch: “the symbols cyclically reversed” is told, not shown, breaking immediacy for a beat. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mist, glow, and echo times create a tactile micro-setting that directly constrains her navigation method. Spatial choreography is clean: footsteps, delays, and threshold shimmer track without drift. The library’s grandeur is glimpsed only at climax, keeping economy. No environment or tool charges the final image beyond the watch’s stillness, capping 8.8 per gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—enter before second letter—stays coherent; each shortening delay tightens the window, a visible price. Reversals force her to discard prior notes, a meaningful forfeiture. Escalation is steady but single-note; no secondary stake or moral trade-off complicates the path. Agency is pure endurance/decoding rather than a decisive fork, sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of persistence-through-uncertainty emerges through pattern rather than statement. The watch’s transformation from con-man tool to honest guide reweights trust without exposition. Final image of silent shelves offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: knowledge demands muteness. No thematic echo lines; one near-moral (“only those who persisted”) is embedded mid-text, not at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic alternation of short & long sentences that mimic delay pulses. Diction skews slightly formal (“propagation delays,” “cipher’s unfolding nature”) but remains within researcher lexicon. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances decoding or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in “She documented… she documented…” pair (−0.2). Metaphors are sparse and coherent (“mist thickened, pulsating”). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops. Final line cadence is satisfying; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Library of Unspoken Words reached via sonic triangulation is fresh; cipher-reversal mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight. Watch’s redemption arc supplies small emotional twist. Risk is moderate—concept-driven puzzle rather than character peril. Tropes (veiled seeker, glowing archive) are familiar but rethreaded through propagation-delay science; not transformative enough for 8.5+.</comment>
