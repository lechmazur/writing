<comment>Elara’s quiet competence with grafting and her ritual of whispering names into the wind are embodied, individual-specific choices that foreclose paralysis. The freeze-then-thaw arc is credible, but interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“the pearl of stillness within her expanded”) that dims the contradiction of grief versus growth. The photograph functions as a concrete tactile anchor, yet the stance shift in the final beat is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, her flaws and agency interlock well enough for mid-high band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of return-to-photograph / return-to-grafting tightens the emotional screw until the lighthouse sweep reweights cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options reconfigured, not resolved—visible in the grafted shoot that embodies “memory and future.” Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual price: automated beam = world moves on without tenders. Minor slack: orientation anchor “after the last lighthouse keeper” arrives late (~140 words), nudging −0.2, but the pattern pays off, so no hard cap.</comment>

<comment>Seaside cliff arboretum is more than postcard: salt-wind and salt-scorched earth actively threaten the saplings, making grafting a high-stakes act. Micro-setting (crumpled photograph in pocket) constrains freeze/flow moments. Spatial choreography clean—hands, pruning shears, cliff edge track believably. Details are filtered through horticulturist bias; no tourist catalog. Final grafted shoot charges closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she stay present when triggered? Single meaningful escalation: aircraft hum → freeze → conscious thaw → graft. Cost is psychic, not external; price (reliving dust and laughter) is felt on the page. Agency is attention-based renunciation of paralysis; no new option is opened, but old option (freeze forever) is foreclosed—sufficient for sub-7 band at this length.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from grafting metaphor: love lost does not erase, it is spliced into new growth. Subtext operates in silence—no mention of war, drones, or guilt aloud—and in the lighthouse’s indifferent automation. Final whispered names reweight the photograph from chain to compost: memory feeds living bark. Avoids sermon; lets image do work, but lacks a second counter-theme to deepen ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited hovers close to Elara’s proprioceptive channel: “chill on her skin, tightness in her chest.” Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction stays within horticultural lexicon. Rhythm mimics breathing: long sentences for calm, fragmented for trigger. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compressed lyric mode is taught early (“wind whispered through rare trees”) and paid off in final graft—legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often carries sensory cue, memory shard, and metaphoric echo. No scaffold loops; only minor paraphrase (“salt-scorched earth” / “salt-scorched” two sentences later) costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent: graft = healing, lighthouse = indifferent time. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure sentence (“she had built a sanctuary…”) is slightly explanatory, but image still lands.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—drone-strike survivor + arboretum horticulture—feels inevitable rather than gimmick: both zones deal with collateral damage and forced regrowth. Grafting as trauma therapy is fresh, not workshop trope. Specificity of junipers flowering in salt wind counters generic PTSD orchard. Risk taken with quiet lyric escalator instead of plot reversal; coherence maintained. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
