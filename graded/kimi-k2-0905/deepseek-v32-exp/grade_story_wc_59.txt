<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prince’s interiority is concrete (“bedraggled appearance spoke of countless failures”) and his micro-choice—whispering apology to the egg—embodies contradictory hope/despair. The “bitterly sweet” refrain edges toward diagnostic shorthand, muting full embodiment at the hinge beat; still, the final renunciation (accepting the ephemeral bird) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>A clear Causal lens: because he finds the egg he therefore assembles the device; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the ghost-bird’s song reweights the “flawed genesis.” The Orientation Test is met by line 2; no teleporting props. The cost is unmistakable—“the egg had given its all”—but the tightening beat is slightly underplayed, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The suspended palace/stalactites anchor every beat; moisture and groans tacitly mirror the prince’s trembling resolve. The crystalline core and moss function as micro-setting that literally powers the climax. No spatial drift; world-rules stay consistent. The egg’s physical fragility constrains handling and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—faces a concrete test when the egg cracks; agency drives each step of assembly. One meaningful tightening: incorporation of organic dew narrows the technical path and raises failure cost. The price is legible but external (palace quake) rather than personal body-risk, capping short of 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “flawed genesis” emerges through event, not lecture: the cracked egg that can never fully live literalizes the idea. The ending’s ephemeral song offers a non-literal answer—beauty can revisit but not stay—without moralizing. Bitter-sweetness recurs with shifting weight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the prince; perceptual signature is filtered through mechanical-vs-organic bias (“the mechanical world hummed”). Syntax lengthens under hope, shortens during trembling; no register drift. Free-indirect cleanly handles “hypothesizing about everything” without academic diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often does description + stakes (“egg felt bitterly sweet, a symbol…”). Rhythm varies across paragraph lengths; no template cadence runs. One mixed metaphor—“quaking reverie”—is purposeful and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; closing line is image-driven, not explanatory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The suspended-palace/egg synthesis is fresh, steering clear of stock steampunk. The extinct-egg-as-relic-of-beauty trope is well-trod, but the “ghostly bird” as memory-manifestation reweights it. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation over combat—yet coherence remains high. Specificity of moss-powered circuitry helps pass the transformation test.</comment>
