<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “dappled resolve” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—ink stamp, drawer probe, scroll claim—each a visible cost under blackout pressure; the interior contradiction between order and messy truth is embodied, not labeled. The only drag is a slight over-clarity in self-diagnosis (“she needed to readjust”) that momentarily tilts toward therapy-speak before re-anchoring in action. Overall, her competence–flaw balance and the final Earned Stasis (she will leave with disorder, not tidy index) feel earned and specific. Voice never flattens; stamp and salt scent recur as charged objects that foreclose the old path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp’s final weightless feel is the Cost image, proving truth is plural and messy; blackout remains, so the price is permanent dark she now embraces. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stamp accumulates a pattern break that reweights knowledge—culminating in the drawer reveal that tightens options: index vs. honest chaos. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by touch & smell within 60 words. One seamless scene, no causal breaks; the “palimpsest” hypothesis is seeded early and paid off physically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: stamp, vellum, warped drawer, salt scent—each constrains tactical choices and charges the final image. Sunken-library frame is evoked sparely (“abyssal hush,” “sunken silence”) yet never drifts into tour-guide list; details filter through indexer’s fingertips. Spatial choreography is flawless; drawer click and scroll scent are legible in darkness. Setting earns 9+ gate: the warped wood literally hides the contraband scrolls that rewrite origin—environment as plot engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each stamp: verified index vs. messy plural truth. Escalation is Accumulative: each stamped margin raises the cost of continuing the old method until the drawer reveal forecloses it. Agency is pure attention and renunciation; no external villain needed. Price is legible: she will exit without light, carrying contradiction; the blackout persists as unpaid cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: indexing as colonial erasure vs. palimpsest human mess. No moralizing; final smile is image-only, reweighting prior “stillness” from comfort to ethical clarity. Subtext lives in touch—stamp embossure becomes evidence of erased voices. The blackout itself turns from obstacle to ethical lens, a Conceptual Repricing that dark is truth’s proper medium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person hovers at indexer’s fingertip distance; perceptual signature is tactile rather than visual—“crisp, raised symbol she could feel.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for memory, staccato clauses for stamp beats. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within indexer’s plausible lexicon. Voice feels singular, not committee; final lightness of stamp is poetic closure without voice drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers smell, texture, and concept (“carved wood of her antique ink stamp, a tool she used to mark verified passages”). Metaphors are spare and coherent (“dappled resolve like light filtering through deep water”). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ consideration; earlier “reclaimed stillness” repetition is thematic pattern, not mechanical loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival noir in blackout, indexer as detective of erased narratives. Palimpsest trope is revived through physical stamp embossure rather than abstract metaphor. Risk taken—no light, no dialogue—pays off in heightened tactile ingenuity. Could edge higher if city’s erasure politics were given one irreplaceable civic detail; as is, still feels specific to this drowned archive.</comment>
