<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist resolve is stated repeatedly but never tested under pressure; she welcomes refugees and offers cuttings without internal contradiction or cost. The “senselessly perceptive” gift is label-only, never constraining or enabling a visible choice. Interiority drifts into cosmic paraphrase (“tranquil blaze,” “continuity woven”) rather than embodied emotion. Closure is gentle stasis, but because no path is foreclosed on-page, the arc feels safe, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the roses thickens the color and pollen imagery until the final beaming dome reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; anchors (daughter, dome, post-tower desert) land by line 20. Closure is Charged Poise—roses carrying pacifist pollen outward—whose conceptual cost (the farm will be overrun?) is felt but not dramatized. One soft loop: “inculcate plants with values” is iterated six times without deepening mechanics, dulling the cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome and sand-scoured exterior create a tactile pressure differential; temperature and texture are implied through rose thorns and canvas grit. The airship scrap’s “quiet symbols” serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—no impossible moves. Sensory selection stays biased to Elara’s horticultural eye, satisfying POV filter without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes—personal sanctuary vs. spreading chaos—are declared early but remain external; the wanderers pose no threat, demand no trade-off. Escalation is purely textural: rose colors intensify, pollen drifts outward; no option narrows for Elara. Agency is limited to continuing what she already does; no resource (water, space, secrecy) is shown depleting. Cost is asserted (“the world outside churned”) rather than felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pacifist transformation emerges through rose propagation rather than authorial sermon. The engraved quiet’s shift from ballast to talisman reweights “stability” from militar cargo to vegetal endurance—an elegant conceptual repricing. Final image of cuttings carried away invites reflection on whether peace can survive transplantation, avoiding tidy moral. Recurrent “inculcate” becomes thematic pulse, though its redundancy slightly flattens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays consistently anchored to Elara’s horticultural perception; no head-hop. Syntax favours horticultural verbs (“tended,” “cultivating,” “whispering”) that texture the voice. Filter verbs are minimal; perception reads direct. Rhythm modulates between long calming sentences and short pollen bursts, mirroring the “tranquil blaze” tone without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “weaving continuity through chaos” appears thrice with minimal variation, docking 0.2. Minor scaffold: “the airship scrap…engraved quiet” is repeated almost verbatim within 40 words. Otherwise diction is concrete, props tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter is fresh angle; roses-as-moral-coding offers organic synthesis rather than checklist quirk. Transformation of military ballast into garden talisman reweights value without belaboured allegory. Risk is quiet—no violent intrusion—but coherence justifies the choice. Could swap desert rose for another hardy flower, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>
