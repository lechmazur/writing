<comment>Interiority is lyrical but leans on abstract labels—“unspoken needs,” “suppressed longing”—rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (pressing, tracing, painting) are present yet feel predetermined by concept; no interior surprise complicates the arc. Flaw is acknowledged (silence) but no blind-spot generates a visible mistake or cost; the climax is recognition, not renunciation. Meets baseline for single-POV affective arc, but missing the hairline friction of genuine self-contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Mosaic pattern taught early—graffiti as encode ritual—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each pigment layer adds density until ghost manifestation reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard hums with “resonant hum,” stories hang in air, options reconfigured—readers feel the cost of eternal exposure even though Elara loses nothing tangible. One transition (storm’s approach) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. Lens ambiguity at midpoint is minor; final image clarifies the dominant stake.</comment>

<comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: its grooves direct pigment flow and literally stamp the sigils—tool choice alters outcome. Misty cloud-courtyard is not generic backdrop; altitude affects how storm electricity activates the graffiti, turning environment into co-protagonist. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (tinkersong chimes) and electro-static scent, mirroring the data-ghost’s arrival. Setting detail is selective, not touristic; final image recharges the same bolt-plate and mist, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—give voice to the voiceless—signaled early; pressure escalates through pigment-layer accumulation rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: approaching storm electrifies the mural, forcing completion before thunder. Ghost emergence is not antagonistic but collaborative, so external risk stays low; cost is opportunity-based (permanent exposure) rather than forfeiture. Escalation reads as density increase under Accumulative lens; meets short-form requirement for single deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: encoded graffiti = silent solidarity; no explicit thesis stated. Chimes and storm reappear at closure with shifted valence—wonder now includes communal audience. Subtext operates through image (flower press = preservation of silenced voices) rather than dialogue. Final paragraph avoids moralizing; resonance is imagistic, earning its wisdom through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s sensorium: “tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert presence” are POV-colored coinages, not authorial flourish. Compression—“between lightning and thunder”—is taught in first sentence and paid off rhythmically in last. Diction stays within balladeer lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Voice modulates from hush to charged hum in sync with storm cadence, achieving perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long breathless clauses build pigment layers; short fragments mark lightning flashes. Information density strong—each sentence layers image, tool function, and emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; “tendrils of code” extends natural metaphor consistently. Minor scaffold: “Between lightning and thunder” repeated four times; because it is pattern-taught and serves as drumbeat mantra, deduction waived under artistic license.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes graffiti activism, steampunk chimes, and data-ghost into fresh cohesion; removing any layer breaks the concept. “Flower press bolt plate” is novel macguffin; bolt-as-pivot literalizes mechanical pressure on feelings. Tinkersong wonder subverts typical storm-gloom into collaborative wonder. Risk feels organic, not gimmick, and heightens rather than obscures closure clarity.</comment>
