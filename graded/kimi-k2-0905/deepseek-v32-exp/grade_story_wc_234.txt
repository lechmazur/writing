<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“palette of resolve” colors reacting in real time—but her contradictory impulses stay abstract; no micro-choice risks tangible loss. Kael functions as supportive mirror rather than crucible; relationship pressure is muted. Final self-revaluation is declared, not dramatized through a costly beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: Kael’s secret → palette shift → shell act → nexus flare. Closure lands—she is “changed,” nexus glowing—but cost is conceptual, not concrete on page. Orientation clean by word 60; single-scene default met. Lens holds as Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Twilight ember nexus is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“dying light,” “low hum”—and the shell’s spiral constrains the energy transfer, anchoring action. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no floating props. Micro-setting (shell) charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single stake: revalue the nexus and capture “density of presence.” Pressure tightens when Kael reframes the nexus as dreaming, forcing Elara to abandon extraction for participation. Tightening is intellectual; no physical or social price is paid on page, keeping cost legible but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: presence as co-creation, not possession. Subtext whispers through shell-as-womb and dream metaphor. Final image of shared light avoids moralizing. No motif recurrence beyond shell; resonance stays local but earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature blends alchemical jargon with lyrical pulse—“scientifically romantic” voice sustained. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments under energy release. One line drifts toward editorial tone: “This scientifically romantic pursuit required…”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong verbs and sensory nouns propel. A few soft filters—“she realized,” “she felt”—dull immediacy near climax. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph repeats “density of presence” three times; minor scaffold. Otherwise clean, read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fusion of pocket-sun alchemy with nautilus-shell energy transfer feels fresh; “palette of resolve” is visual synesthesia that works. Dreaming nexus reframes entropy without apocalypse. Conceptual risk stays safe—no rule-breaking science or social edge—but specificity lifts it above stock eco-fantasy.</comment>
