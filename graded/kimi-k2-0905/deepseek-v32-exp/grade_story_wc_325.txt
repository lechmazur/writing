<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—“to stand by the unremembered”—is stated early and threads every beat; her claustrophobia is embodied in helmet-hitches and wall-squeezes rather than labels. Micro-choices (codex placement, step into gaseous wall) align with motive and visibly cost calm. The interior arc—fear → purposeful endurance → earned lightness—lands cleanly, though researchers remain symbolic; no individual scientist complicates her stance. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; body and breath carry emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the codex alignment releases ghost-researchers, reweighting Elara’s personal grief and the facility’s history with undeniable conceptual cost (“they were no longer alone”). Causal chain holds—codex → hologram → safe path → core chamber → tidal deadline; each phase transition narrows time/space options. One soft spot: the “crashing hush” metaphor is repeated without deepening; luckily it never touches the final image. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sub-ocean facility, sparking cables, phase-shifting corridors, and the codex’s gold fleck are rendered through Elara’s urgent senses—sound of spark, feel of mist-wall, sight of glowing path. Spatial choreography is clean: tunnel → corridor → cable hall → core chamber; bodies and distances track. The gold fleck itself acts as micro-setting, guiding movement and charging the closing light. Weather/tide are external timers that reshape access, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return codex before tide seals access—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens with every phase transition, climaxing as water “began to flow differently.” Escalation is physical and temporal: walls liquefy, pathways flicker, tidal window shrinks; each transition forecloses retreat. Visible price is paid—breath hitches, pulse pounds, time lost—altering later speed. One minor slip: researchers’ stakes stay abstract; no live antagonist raises personal cost beyond symbolic gratitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory’s duty vs. oblivion—emerges through action, not sermon: codex return revives ghosts, reweighting “unremembered” from abstract vow to visible release. Subtext rests in gold fleck’s glow: science once illuminated, now literally re-illuminates the dead. Final smile reframes earlier terror; no moral is stated. Slight abstraction of researcher gratitude keeps it from top band, but resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptions: “helmet,” “walls shift,” “heart pounded.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under stress: “breath hitched.” Diction remains within explorer lexicon; no academic register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; perceptual signature (glow = invisible guide) is consistent. One tiny loop: “crashing hush” repeated thrice with identical phrasing; still legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for descent, clipped fragments for crisis. Mixed metaphors avoided; “walls rippled like water” is clean. One paraphrase loop: “the crashing hush… filled every corridor—a silence so profound it felt like noise” restates the same idea. Information density is high; sentences perform dual work (setting + interiority). No grammar slips; pronoun trail clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of deep-sea archaeology, phase-transition physics, and medieval codex feels fresh; no trope checklist. Gold fleck as invisible-path tracker transforms standard glow into navigational tech. Ghostly researchers materializing through phase-shift is an inevitable yet surprising payoff. Risk lies in quiet lyrical ending rather than action spectacle; coherence maintained. Could swap facility name or exact cable layout, so not fully irreplaceable, but synthesis is memorable.</comment>
