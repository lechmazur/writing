<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific to Elara’s perceptual world; “the mercury-glass showed her reflections of possible futures” dramatizes thought without label-speak. Contradictory impulses—fleeing memory yet hungering for connection—co-exist in the same beats, giving credible tension. The final renunciation of substituted realities is earned by iterative, visibly costly nightly sessions; the feather-as-bridge makes the turn legible. Voice stays consistent, but the emotional crescendo leans on repeated abstract nouns (“acceptance,” “truth”) that slightly dilute embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she touches the stone with the feather, therefore lost languages flow back, therefore she redefines home as pattern not place. Orientation anchors—who/where/when—surface by line 3 and are re-anchored each night-cycle, so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the glyphs rearrange into her image at the center, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (“home was wherever she chose to nurture connection”). Persistent constraint—the stone stays in its niche, her talents now irreversibly awakened—shapes the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is evoked through vertical motion—“shelves shifting as if acknowledging her intent”—so setting actively constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s seer bias: mercury shimmer, obsidian texture, feather vane silk dominate over sound or scent. Spatial choreography is clean; the same niche, pool, and corridor reappear in altered states, preventing geography drift. Micro-setting (feather, stone) charges the final image when their texture becomes the conduit for self-reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—will she dare to remember—tightens once per nightly iteration, each session peeling another layer of avoidance. Escalation is textural/accumulative: density of glyph-light and thunder-rumble increases until the mountain itself breathes, reweighting the cost of retreat. Agency is present—she chooses to press feather to stone, to seed the question—but the external antagonist (the labyrinth) remains semi-sentient, softening pure causality. Visible price is legible: substituted realities are forfeited, replaced by the sharper ache of clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: home as a mutable pattern seeded by courage, not a fixed place. The feather’s return as final conduit reweights its initial tactile comfort into a tool of relinquishment, accomplishing conceptual repricing. Subtext resides in silence—the store’s “breathing” shelves speak louder than any declaration. Only minor drift into aphorism (“home was wherever she chose…”) keeps this from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a consistent perceptual signature: mercury-reflections, glyph-heat, silk-vane sensations filter through Elara’s seer bias. Rhythm modulates—long, liquid sentences during scrying, clipped fragments at the thunder-crack—mirroring her psychic distance. No dialogue, so voice evaluation focuses on narrative texture, which remains individual and unborrowed. Rare template cadence (“she…she…she”) appears in two adjacent sentences but is too isolated to blunt momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines multitask: “the stone pulsed with a warm, steady light” simultaneously signals success, elapsed time, and emotional thaw. Metaphors stay coherent—mercury, stone, feather form a tight elemental triad without mixed-vehicle clash. One paraphrase loop (“home was…home was…”) in the final paragraph dulls the cadence slightly. Otherwise, information density is high, propelling rather than stalling the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer who fears her own sight is a fresh inversion of the oracle trope. Combining labyrinthine bookstore-mountain with lost-language lithic tech feels inevitable in hindsight yet unfamiliar on first encounter. Risk is taken in the quiet, iterative structure—no villain, no chase—yet pressure still accumulates through textural density. The feather-as-key twist is small but non-obvious, grounding originality in tactile specificity rather than concept alone.</comment>
