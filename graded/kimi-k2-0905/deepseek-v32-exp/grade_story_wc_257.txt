<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied through metallic heaviness and the refusal to hammer, but the interiority slips into therapeutic summary (“her hands too heavy with grief”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The micro-choice to fold and hide her own cranes is present, but the cost is reported (“she realized...”) rather than dramatized, so the final pivot feels slightly foretold rather than earned in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mosaic trail of origami clues teaches an Accumulative pattern early; each find tightens the stake from stasis to renewal. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open curtains and steady star-lamp reconfigure grief from terminus to cycle with undeniable conceptual cost. Only minor slack: the grandfather’s retroactive motive is revealed post-hoc, not seeded as constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory’s dome light, velvet curtains, and vellum stencil function as micro-setting that literally reframes her perception; the falling-petal shadow on the wall is a tactile fulcrum. Timeless architecture remains lightly sketched, but the selective astral and bench details constrain her choices (where she places lamps, how she guides visitors), cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief into regenerative art—tightens once: the stencil-shadow epiphany reweights her craft from memorial to metamorphosis. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-sequential; each origami find incrementally narrows her refusal-to-act until she folds her own cranes, a visible price paid in public vulnerability. No forced antagonist; pressure is internal coherence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the shifting paper trail rather than explicit sermon: “withering to bloom again” is never spoken by Elara. The rose stencil’s dying-into-budding image reconfigures mourning jewelry into life-cycle artifact; final woman’s whisper “felt like a friend in the darkness” provides resonant non-literal answer. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “comma in the story of life” edges toward aphorism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual bias toward metallic texture and starlight. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fragments slightly during crane discoveries; rhythmic control supports pressure without monotony. No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet internal diction stays within lexicon of artisan-astronomer lineage. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful (“she saw,” “she realized”) occur at legitimate revelation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured but disciplined: silver petals “fell into gemstone buds” compresses process and metaphor in one clause. No synonym loops, no scaffold. Opening line anchors profession and loss simultaneously; final line returns to star simile with cadence lift. One hairline repetition—“genuinely artificial comfort” and earlier “genuinely artificial symbol”—is intentional thematic reweighting, not churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-renewal arc is inverted through astronomer-jeweler hybrid and origami scavenger-hunt pedagogy; combination feels idiosyncratic, not checklist. Rose stencil on vellum as catalytic tattoo-template is fresh artifact. Risk of instructional allegory is fully embraced and paid off via participatory coordinates, turning readers into initiates. Transformation test fails if elements swapped—observatory light geometry and paper-fold mechanics are integral.</comment>
