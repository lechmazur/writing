<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s gentle listener/curator persona is consistent and embodied in micro-gestures with the hearing-aid tuning; yet the interior contradiction between duty and fatigue never activates, so no new path is foreclosed—“incidental hero” is asserted rather than dramatized as a costly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mist-pulse layer tightens the hush until the photograph warms, delivering a Charged Poise with felt cost—Eleanor’s dissipation reweights Elara’s vocation; no orientation debt; sole soft spot is that the奶奶 lore block arrives late and summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass-domed atrium, mist, and marble bench are sketched with chilly acoustic specificity; the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical move; final image of warming photo crystallizes the stake—no excess geography, all pressure-filtered through Elara’s tuned perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving Eleanor’s voice—signals early; pressure tightens via pulse-intensity, not reversal; the cost (Elara’s solitude and perpetual on-call burden) is visible in final seated beat; could escalate further if a live alternative were foreclosed, but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-resistance emerges wordlessly through the photo’s warming and the dissipation tableau; no platitudes, only the hush itself re-prices the cost of Elara’s listening life; ambiguity lingers—she is both savior and perpetually haunted—earned via concrete acoustics, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Lyrical, hush-paced cadence mirrors atrium acoustics; diction stays inside Elara’s tactile lexicon (“decades-old hearing aid,” “reeling hush”); no head-hop; minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to part”) dull immediacy but align with dream-logic; voice distinct enough under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Rhythmic variation between long breathy sentences and short pulses propels; mixed metaphors avoided; one scaffold pair (“the reeling hush… respectful, almost sacred quiet”) recycles hush concept but occurs pre-closure; no artifact in final third; high-info lines carry both sensory and emotional load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>“Contact tracer for the dead via antique hearing-aid” is a fresh synthesis; incidental heroism trope remains thematic label rather than surprising turn; photograph reprise gives inevitability; could risk more by complicating the after-life rules or Elara’s ethical edge—stays safe but pleasing.</comment>
