<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “feel the weave of time” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—longing to measure vs. longing to experience—stays verbal; no single micro-choice under pressure dramatizes the clash. The urn fragment focuses her, yet the decisive turn (sharing the equation with Leo) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost is announced rather than felt. Secondary pressure from Leo is clean, but his descent-from-mathematician beat is delivered as exposition, muting status shift. Closure earns a Charged Poise, but the emotional price is gestural (“etched into her consciousness”), not corporal, capping renunciation at 7-plus band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of garage-sale clues → urn → equation; each shard adds density until the “melody” re-prices time. Orientation is swift: who/where/when inside 60 words; no debt incurred. Closure is a legit CR: the equation reframes time from countdown to melody, with conceptual cost (old calendars now “lie”). Causality is soft—Leo’s arrival is coincidence—but under Accumulative lens that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the rule. Missing only a visceral, on-body cost at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emerald silo’s green metal hum is tactile from line 1 and constrains every beat—light filters, rain timbre, garage-sale table placement—earning micro-setting status. Spatial choreography is pristine: debris pile → display table → stranger’s pointing finger all tracked in continuous motion. Object-as-setting (urn shard) is handled twice, its cool curve altering Elara’s stance and later cradled in closure, qualifying 9-gate. The only bar: world-rules of “numbers changed meaning” stay abstract, never tested by a concrete calendar contradiction, so environment stops just short of shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can time be felt, not just counted—tightens through pattern, not plot: each garage tag deepens the stakes of mis-reading time. Mid-story “time holds its breath” is the visible cadence shift that reweights the tapestry image, foreclosing sterile measurement. Cost is conceptual (old math discredited) rather than corporeal; under Accumulative lens this is valid, but a palpable price (a lost keepsake, a cut finger) would push higher. Pressure stays coherent; no reversal, yet deepening suffices for 600-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: repeated sales tags → communal re-storying of time → equation-as-music, all shown, never tagged “this is theme.” Final image—“time…a melody”—reprises the hummed silo, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: the cracked urn = fractured chronology, but symbolism stays latent, never decoded aloud. Complex ambiguity survives: is numeric time truly dead, or just re-tuned? Reader leaves with resonance, not rule.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person channels Elara’s perceptual signature—time as texture, color-as-sound—via controlled synesthesia: “aged metal that hummed,” “cool curve” of porcelain. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under revelation (“etched into her consciousness”), mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop; Leo’s interior is only inferred. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt”) they are voice-motivated, not clutter. Dialogue is spare but idiomatic: “The numbers lied, but the ashes remember” carries subtext without slipping into manifesto.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence = garage-sale clue + sensory hit + conceptual tilt. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (time as tapestry, melody). Rhythm modulates: short declaratives for stranger’s arrival, longer lyrical coils for reflection. Minor scaffold: “in the days that followed” is boilerplate transition, but it lands outside climax and does not obscure closure. Keeps 9-band by a hairline; one more mixed metaphor or late filler clause would have clipped it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fuses post-collapse time-theory with junk-sale ephemera—fresh angle on familiar dystopia. Garage-tag cryptography as plot engine is non-obvious and specific; could not swap in random raffle tickets. Risk: lyric treatment of math-as-music could tilt precious, but grounded in rusted hinges and ash it stays tactile. Conceptual repricing (numbers “lie,” melody “remembers”) feels inevitable yet surprising. Lacks the final daring structural gambit that would push 9.5, but still memorable.</comment>
