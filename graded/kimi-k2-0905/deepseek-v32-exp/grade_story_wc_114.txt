<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority drifts into diagnostic self-speak (“fault-tolerant oracle,” “swallowed truth”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses; the fever recovery and sensor recalibration beats show micro-action but never test her predictive gift under live stakes, so her arc stays abstract. The swallowed-truth motivation is declared repeatedly yet never dramatized as a specific memory or externalized conflict, so the promised emotional weight stays conceptual. No relationship or secondary character pressure is on the page, leaving her essentially alone with a label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as a soft conceptual shift—“lightness of truth”—rather than a decisive action or charged poise with felt cost; the recalibration is narrated, not dramatized, so the before/after is legible only in thematic assertion. Causal linkage is weak: the smudge on the drawing does not mechanically alter any sensor or forecast; the storm trend is discovered off-stage in historical charts, not through her oracle gift under pressure. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural but the final image reweights nothing palpable, so the cost is intellectual, not experienced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The station’s isolation, cold machinery, and auroral light are filtered through Elara’s perceptual fatigue; wind hum and sweat-soaked blanket ground us in body. Spatial tracking is clean: bed → wall → console → window → console again, each move tethered to sensory stimulus. The Bloom illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains her attention, but its microclimate link is asserted, not discovered through tactile exploration, so environment never actively pressures choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Declared stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—remains abstract; no external deadline, resource limit, or audience for her forecasts appears, so pressure is internal and diffuse. Escalation is a single loop: erratic data → illustration → off-page historical correlation → forecast tweak; no live storm or equipment failure forces an irreversible decision. The swallowed truth’s cost is never sharpened into a choice between publishing a possibly wrong warning or protecting her reputation, so stakes stay conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through motif repetition (smudges, margins, fault-tolerance) rather than explicit sermon, but the articulation is front-loaded in the first third and merely echoed thereafter. The Bloom as metaphor for rare, fragile insight is coherent yet static; it constrains no tactical choice. Final “lightness of truth” offers a pleasing conceptual reprice but lacks concrete after-effect, so resonance is mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly glued to Elara’s embodied perception; syntax flexes with fatigue (“auroral sorrow,” “swayed certainties”) without purple drift. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative diction remains consistent and character-specific. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she was peripherally aware”) and do not dilute immediacy; perceptual signature is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Paragraph rhythm breathes with beats; sentence openings vary and avoid template cadence. Figurative phrases (“auroral sorrow,” “stone in her throat”) are spare and earned, never stacked. One paraphrase loop (“she had learned to smudge the lines… by occupying margins”) repeats concept without fresh detail; otherwise density is high. No grammar or pronoun drift; copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing climatology with botanical rarity gives a fresh slant on the “isolated scientist” trope; the oracle-illness-recalibration arc feels specific to this peak and this woman. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of causal thriller—but the piece commits fully. Could swap Bloom for rare lichen without structural break, so irreplaceability is partial; still, the synthesis of data-art hybrid prediction is memorable.</comment>
