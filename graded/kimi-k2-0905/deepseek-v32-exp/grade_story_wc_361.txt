<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Jittery courier trait stated, not embodied—hands shake once, then vanish; no contradictory impulse under pressure. Mentor absence is back-story label; it never alters his on-page choices. Final “calm determination” declared, not earned; no micro-choice shows the shift. Interiority drifts into prompt-speak: “coax wonder from the routine” repeated like thesis.

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held: aurora, pendant hum, traveler’s mythic speech layer density rather than cause tight linkage. Closure is Charged Poise—pendant’s steady hum re-weights the relic’s meaning—but cost is conceptual, not felt. Orientation clear by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: traveler’s speech deepens stakes from “tedious job” to “carrier of stories,” but traveler exits without testing Kaelen’s agency.

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid, selective, and mirrors interior shift from jittery to tranquil; color progression tracks emotional cadence. Dragonfly pendant functions as micro-setting, constraining attention and pacing through its vibrations. Spatial choreography clean—traveler emerges, speaks, withdraws without teleport. Weather (aurora) affects mood, not tactical choice; hence stays below 8.8 gate.

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find magic in mundane deliveries”—signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or forfeiture attached. Escalation is tonal layering, not option-narrowing; traveler’s words complicate worldview but do not block or force a decision. Cost is conceptual (relic now feels “lighter”), not visceral; meets 8.8 gate threshold only weakly. Agency is receptive listening, not active choice; luck of encounter drives turn.

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—routine labor transmuted into myth—emerges through aurora, pendant, relic, not thesis lines. Subtext in traveler’s speech about memory-to-myth is effective; no character moralizes. Final image of sunrise on Thornsreach re-prices prior night without sermon. Theme slightly diffuse because “wonder” is told more than tested by loss.

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stable; perceptual signature relies on light/color synesthesia (“aurora shifted from green to violet”). Rhythm varies—long breathy clauses mirror aurora sweep, then tighten at traveler’s arrival. No dialogue to judge, avoiding voice convergence risk. Occasional template cadence (“he felt… he remembered… he vowed”) drifts toward list, kept below 8.8.

</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, no loops or synonym churn; figurative language disciplined to two per sentence max. Filter verbs minimal; sensory detail woven through motion. Register stable, no corporate drift. Minor scaffold: “the pendant… the pendant… the pendant” anaphora in final third; artifact touches closure, caps 9+ eligibility.

</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mythic-courier trope refreshed by aurora-energy pendant that literalizes “stretching time,” but concept remains familiar. Risk is lyric accumulation rather than plot surprise; payoff legible, not bold. Specific detail—dragonfly-wing frame, color-shifting sky—lifts it above generic fantasy travelogue. Transformation test: swap aurora for desert mirage, story still functions, limiting originality.
