<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s gently persistent trait is repeatedly named but never weaponized under pressure; the bell is clutched and rung yet her interiority stays generic (“thoughts as heavy as humid air”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the climactic declaration feels pre-ordained rather than earned. Still, her calm micro-command keeps volunteers oriented and the generational bridge is credibly maintained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: bell raised, declaration whispered, cost felt in the hush. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of midnight runs → bell chimes → tokens left—but the tightening is one-note (sanctions stay static). No new constraint or price appears at the end; the “future” is asserted, not foreclosed, so the reconfiguration is modest.</comment>

<comment>Terra-cotta arbor is sketched with heat-stroke economy: “weathered arches” echo footfalls, dust, muted clinks. Sensory hierarchy favors hush—moonlight, sweat, soft chime—so the ridge becomes a resonating chamber for secrecy. Micro-setting works: the arbor constrains acoustics and hides parcels, charging the final raised-bell image. More tactile navigation (hips brushing clay, flakes on palms) would lift it to 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep exiles alive and unified—remains stable; no resource loss or external raid escalates tension. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the single meaningful turn is Elara’s declaration, which reweights survival into “building a future” but incurs no visible cost or foreclosed option. Agency is present yet static; midnight runs succeed anonymously every time, muting jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet intergenerational resistance emerges through ritual (bell, food runs, token exchanges) rather than exposition. Final image—bell raised against stars—offers non-literal answer: endurance itself is the future. Avoids moralizing, but lacks a contradictory voice to complicate the moral calculus; ambiguity is present yet thin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s selective attention: silence, humidity, silver glint. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during cart-loading, mirroring breath. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within her lexicon (“swift and silent”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm: paragraph lengths swell and contract with mission tempo. No scaffold loops; however, four consecutive sentences in the final paragraph open with “The…” creating template cadence. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“moon rise over weathered arches”). Minor tightening needed to remove two adjectives (“humid night air” → “wet air”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar sanctioned-camp trope is refreshed by antique bell as acoustic tech and terra-cotta arbor as resonance chamber. Anonymous-donation mystery stays unexplained, resisting expositive twist. Risk is quiet rather than bold; no structural experiment, but specificity of ritual lifts it above NGO-report template.</comment>
