<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grace hidden under grime, longing caged by fear—remains concrete and embodied; the scrimshaw’s warming against her palm is a micro-choice that externalizes the tug-of-war. The final surrender is not a tidy epiphany but a visceral dissolving of the bone-key in sea-foam, making the cost of her guarded heart legible. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; her solitary stance crystallizes with earned, visible price. Voice stays particular to her dock-honed perception without lapsing into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the island’s sudden solidity reconfigures her entire world, scrimshaw dissolves, and the reader feels the irreversible forfeiture of the shore she leaves behind. Causality is lyrical but coherent—whale-call → bone-warm → island unlock—each because/therefore link tightening options until the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 50 words; no penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of call, bone, tide, and mist accumulates until the pattern breaks into manifested sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is not backdrop but tactical terrain: the exposed stones give her footing to reach the island, the shimmer in the air is the hinge beat where myth becomes navigable. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and bone-temperature—dock worker’s idiom—over tourist-catalog vistas. Weather and tide are causal, not decorative; receding tide literally exposes the path. Micro-setting (scrimshaw-as-key) constrains her final step and charges the dissolving image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from self-imposed guardedness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the call forces the binary, stay ashore or detach. The price is the literal disappearance of her former life; island arrival forecloses return, cost is visible in the fading port lights. Escalation is situational pressure crystallizing stance, not multiple reversals, adequate for 700-word span. Agency is renunciation rather than combat, consistent with post-violence world rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the leitmotif of keys and unlocking: guarded heart, bone key, island appearing only for the summoned. No character articulates thesis; meaning is charged in the final image of foam where the scrimshaw was—conceptual repricing that reweights all prior hiding. Ambiguity lingers: is the island freedom or another cage? Tenderness and combat coexist without forced balance, giving the thematic chord complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—temperature of bone, weight of crates, soundless whale vibration in marrow. Syntax lengthens and softens during surrender, mimicking tidal pull, then fragments at dissolving moment. No dialogue appears; thus dialogue bullets are waived. Register remains within a dockworker’s sensorium, no academic diction drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense: “whalebone scrimshaw, carved with the image of a leviathan” packs noun-specificity without modifiers. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either tide-level or emotional level. Figurative language is sparse and precise—grace hidden beneath grime, combative tenderness—never crowding a single beat. Final paragraph slows cadence to match surrendered exhale, ear-test passes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-Pacification world plus whale-summoned island is fresh synthesis; violence made impossible reroutes mythic call into internal detachment rather than conquest. Scrimshaw-as-literal-key and island visible only to the summoned avoid generic portal fantasy. Transformation test: swap out whale-call or bone and entire emotional engine collapses. Risk is lyrical quietude rather than spectacle, paid off by crystalline closure image.</comment>
