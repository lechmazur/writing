<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember versus the ban’s danger—are sketched more than dramatized; the cosmic-verse motive is vivid, yet her micro-choices under pain are summarized (“agonizing yet exquisite”) rather than shown, keeping the interior cost at arm’s length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Closure lands: the verse is irreversibly etched, exile flips to purpose, moonstone fades—cost is felt. Causal chain holds: nostalgia ban → exile → dance → dust → skin. Orientation clear by line 6; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, tightened by final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Garden, star-gaps, moonstone vial supply tactile anchors that constrain the ritual; body-as-canvas micro-setting is handled throughout. Selective sensory detail (“hum of obsidian grace”) sustains atmosphere without checklist overload; final image recharges the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—illicit remembrance—signals early; pressure tightens once when dust anchors and forecloses retreat. Cost (searing pain, permanent exile) is visible; escalation is single-crest, sufficient for lyric 700-word arc but lacks secondary complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—memory as defiant art—without sermon. Final crystallization reweights nostalgia from crime to cosmic stewardship; ambiguity (will others follow?) lingers, inviting reflection. Resonance rises from concrete image, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is lush, tidal, consistent: “obsidian grace,” “tides of fate” mirror dancer’s worldview. Rhythmic variation mirrors ritual crescendo; no head-hops. Diction stays within lyric register taught early; compression taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with ritual; clauses lengthen then fragment under pain. Some metaphor stacking (“blanket of emerging stars,” “obsidian grace”) verges on purple but pattern is taught and serves climax; no loops or scaffold obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tide-dance, star-gap calligraphy, and skin-parchment feels fresh; nostalgia-ban world-rule is speculative tweak, not full reinvention. Specificity of moonstone dust as ink and twilight garden as studio keeps premise from sliding into abstract trope.</comment>
