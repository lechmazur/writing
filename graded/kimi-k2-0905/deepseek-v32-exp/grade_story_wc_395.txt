<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “where deleted files go” is concrete and drives every beat; the interiority stays technical-archivist, never generic. The moment she links the patch’s thread to a broadcast frequency, her perceptual lens tightens—micro-choice visible. Cost is felt at the end: she preserves the data but accepts the case will stay cold, an earned stasis that pays for her lie. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the arc is competent rather than complex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reframes all prior searches as a quest into “silence between the notes,” reweighting the premise with undeniable existential cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of numbers, patch, absence imagery accrues until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening—accessing the hidden cluster—narrows options and is paid for by the lie. Cost is legible in the last sentence: “she would keep listening” to unending silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The humming servers, “unmarked tombs,” and cool air anchor the archive as both graveyard and workspace; micro-setting succeeds. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through archivist precision—metadata, scan resolution, frequency—never tourist catalog. The patch’s frayed thread and the “echo of forgotten songs” reappear at closure, recharging the absence motif. Spatial choreography is clean; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why files vanish—signaled in paragraph 1. One deepening: discovering the messages proves sabotage, tightening the moral cost of preservation. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of 11-23-35 thickens the texture of desperation. Agency is present—lying to gain access—but the external antagonist remains off-stage, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; cost is conceptual, felt in the final silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as complicity in erasure. The deleted fragments’ scattering becomes a metaphor for unacknowledged deaths; final image of “silence between the notes” reweights the quest from location to ethical witness. No moralizing—resonance arises from the patch’s repaired thread and the crew’s ghost code. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation an act of justice or mere voyeurism?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature—sharp lens, cataloging impulse. Free indirect style stays clean: “The sensed absence deepened” reads as her internal register. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into short, data-heavy clauses during the cluster breach, then lengthens into the final cadence of silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does archival, emotional, and plot work—“the deleted entries were its unmarked tombs” layers metaphor and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay consistent. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously. Minor register lift in “existential silence” is earned by prior accumulation of ghost imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: corporate data archivist as cosmic grave-keeper. The patch’s mismatched thread repurposed as frequency key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in quiet, Conceptual Repricing ending pays off. Slight deduction for familiar “ghost in the machine” trope, rescued by specific archival detail.</comment>
