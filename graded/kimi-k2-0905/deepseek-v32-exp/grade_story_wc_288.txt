<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured, embodied, and pressure-tested; the “brittle awakening” motif governs micro-choices (hand on sundial, step into circle) so motives stay concrete. The decisive turn—choosing guardianship—carries visible cost (permanent library exile as living archive) and is foreshadowed by her tactile reverence for the Aetherian ghosts. Slight over-articulation of “coexist” and “translate isolation” nudges toward thesis-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces downward life, accepting endless custodianship; cost is the lifelong weight of ghost-presence made explicit in the final image. Causal lattice holds—sundial glows only when circle hums, hum arises only when she steps in, so the renunciation is mechanically inevitable. Orientation is clean inside 60 words; no lens ambiguity; time/space stay anchored. One hairline slip: “progress of her spirit” is slightly diagnostic, but it occurs after the irrevocable choice, so penalty is minimal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal library is not backdrop but tactical resource: floating books physically deliver forgotten pages to her after her stance shift, proving environment rewards her decision. Micro-setting (body + sundial) constrains every beat—she can’t read history until brass surface catches the hum, so setting gate is satisfied. Sensory economy is tight: cloud-swell, obsidian pedestal, bone-borne hum all filtered through her Aetherian-biased perception. No spatial drift; geography remains legible across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens exactly once: the hum forces her either to shatter or to assume eternal guardianship; that fork is dramatized, not declared. Price is legible: lifelong exile aloft, ghost-oversoul never silent again. Pressure escalates under causal lens (each intensification of hum → brighter sundial → sharper visions) rather than multiple reversals, satisfying short-form requirement. No off-stage rescue; coincidence merely enables vision, does not resolve conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—sundial’s atomically reflective face moves from passive mirror to active judge of spirit-time—rather than overt statement. Final image of her unwavering reflection ringed by ghost-kin reweights “brittle awakening” from fragility to crystallized duty without moralizing. Subtext of archival grief versus living legacy stays implicit; reader invited to interrogate cost of perpetual memory. One soft echo of prompt language (“translate isolation into independence”) costs −0.2, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is Aetherian-sensory (cloud-taste, bone-hum) rather than generic wonder. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—“atomically reflective,” “reincarnation memory”—phrases the Aetherians would coin. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under hum-crescendo, longer reflective sentences in book-drift aftermath. No dialogue, so no convergence issue; internal voice remains coherent across the peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are internally coherent—light held “in a way that defied ordinary physics” is literal diegetic rule, not poetic excess. Sentence cadence varies: fragmentary bursts under hum-stress, then expansive closure line that mirrors tidal rhythm. One near-miss filter stack “she realized that…” is immediately redeemed by embodied follow-through, keeping artifact penalty beneath visibility threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-haunted librarian with cloud-borne archive, a synthesis not duplicated in familiar SFF templates; specificity of “atomically reflective sundial as spirit chronometer” freshens standard relic trope. Conceptual risk—quiet ending chooses stasis over triumph—pays off by reweighting isolation as chosen solitude, not pathology. Transformation test fails if relocated to ground-level setting, confirming irreplaceability. No close echoes of canonical scenes; voice retains alien-Aetherian cadence throughout.</comment>
