<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s “withdrawn” trait is asserted but never contradicted or pressured; he moves from isolation to isolation without relational crucible. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“shivering bliss,” “endless night”) instead of embodied contradiction. The final “unsnapping doubts” is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice shows cost. Motivation stays static—he wants possibility, he gets possibility—so no flaw complicates the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb crystallizes every path not taken and the pamphlet disintegrates, so a before/after is legible with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-tracing and chant deepen density until reality reconfigures. The lens holds, but orientation wobbles: “reality felt thin” is vague anchor at 120-word mark; waiver denied because the payoff reuses the same vagueness. One meaningful tightening—program glows, orb appears—suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse void, silver branches, and luminescent fruits create a tactile micro-setting that charges the final orb image. Detail is selective: gauntlet removed to feel paper, brass clasps, fading program—each object constrains the next action. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating props. The “endless night” remains atmospheric shorthand rather than a lived obstacle, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by density: each traced pattern makes the greenhouse ripple and lights flicker, narrowing options toward the single orb. Cost is conceptual but legible: the program crumbles, foreclosing future use. No visible price is extracted from Alaric himself, so the tightening feels external rather than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: artifice (puppets, patterns) as a means to wield ungoverned potential. Subtext resides in the image of strings controlling chance, reweighted when the strings dissolve into dust. No moral is stated; the final “murmured allegiance to the bliss” is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity is present but thin because the knight’s inner conflict never complicates the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Alaric’s perceptual filter: gauntleted fingers, murmured voice, internal snap. Syntax is rhythmic and slightly archaic (“factually mystical,” “crystallized maybe”) without drifting into purple. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged on narrative texture alone; it remains consistent. Occasional template cadence (“He… then he…”) knocks it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but leans on stacked modifiers (“luminescent fruits… factually mystical light”) that slow high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, yet “shivering bliss” is repeated without escalation, dulling the final cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—strings, puppets, orb—avoiding mixed vehicles. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse, seemed to ripple”) appears mid-scene, just under the 9+ disqualifier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemic orchard grown to fruit “possibility” is a fresh frame, not a stock fantasy grove. Puppet-string metaphysics fused with quantum orchard avoids the usual fate-vs-free-will cliché. Risk is moderate: reality-shift without rules, but the piece commits to its lyric logic. Transformation is present—pamphlet dust becomes the price—yet the knight himself is unchanged, limiting resonance.</comment>
