<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s quiet drive and spiral-shell calling feel lived-in; the reed-whistle choice under heat shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“his fingers reading histories”), never drifting into label-speak. Mentor-loss motive cleanly powers every beat; the final cartographer-to-translator shift is earned. No contradictory impulses visible under pressure, so just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: gate shutdown → mentor loss → pattern decoding → whistle crack → vision → city stance change, all linked by because/therefore. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the nod reweights isolation into shared purpose with conceptual cost—gate stays shut. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“city of Aethelburg shifted imperceptibly”); no penalty. One minor causality gap: how pattern knowledge translates to audible shell-crack is elided, but the reed’s spiral mirroring bridges acceptably.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Turtle-carapace micro-setting constrains every move; the highest point choice and hair-crack glow are charged by this terrain. Sensory economy favors heat, calcium dust, reedy timbre—never tourist catalog. “Sunwashed dread” is filtered through Kaelen’s cartographer gaze, baking fear into stone and bone. Setting directly shapes the final image: the sealed yet luminous crack is the city’s new language.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the lost expedition—signaled early. Pressure tightens when harmonic flaw is found; playing the whistle is the single decisive act that narrows options to acknowledgment or eternal silence. Cost is visible: the shell cracks, cool air escapes, gate remains shut—permanent isolation accepted. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 800-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern vs. stagnation: the city’s slow drift mirrors unexamined life. The watchers’ silence and the expedition’s suspended flicker pose the same question—will Aethelburg recognize its own decay? Final image of purposeful quiet reweights earlier dread without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Kaelen; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—spiral-reading fingers, calcium whorls as text—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with heat: long sentences swell, then snap at whistle note. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“histories written in calcium and time”). Metaphors stay physical and coherent—shell as map, crack as syntax. Rhythm accelerates into the whistle beat, then cools with the exhaled air. No figurative muddle under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Turtle-city + pattern-language cartography feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Reed whistle’s spiral-to-shell mirroring offers a fresh acoustic key to a living world. Risk of cosmic guardians and spiritual decay could slide into abstraction, but grounded in Kaelen’s tactile decoding. Synthesis is specific enough that transplanting names would break the concept.</comment>
