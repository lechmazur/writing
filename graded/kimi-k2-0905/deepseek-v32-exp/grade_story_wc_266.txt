<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—terror of untethering vs. hunger for self-authorship—stays alive in every beat; the star stamp brands her skin with visible cost, sealing the renunciation of the old leash. Guides stay archetypal, so relationship crucible is weak, yet their calm functions as pressure mirror. Emotional arc layers credibly: fear→vertigo→earned poise. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment vivid (“quiet hum in her blood”). End stasis earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each sensory shard adds density until the final moonlit shore reconfigures the stake from “find courage” to “become the holder of courage.” Orientation line 1 gives who/where; transitions legible; no mid-paragraph hops. Closure is Charged Poise: the star glows, the lullaby plays—options re-weighted, cost felt without exposition. No plot amnesia; leash absence stays causally active throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mist, moss, salt air, pine silhouettes—details are selective, filtered through Elara’s body-as-barometer. The ridgeway’s slippery indirection literally forces the winding path that produces courage; setting is antagonist-coach. Star punch and shoreline micro-objects charge final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where is unused courage?”—signaled line 3. Escalation is textural densification rather than causal reversals: each indirect trail adds felt risk, narrowing option to ‘keep walking or retreat’; star stamp = visible price. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Final poise crystallizes stance without external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: courage as renewable internal resource discovered via motion, not quest-end. Subtext in gesture—guides’ silence, ticket click—more powerful than exposition. Lullaby motif re-weights from lull to self-soothing power. Final image resists moral, offers conceptual repricing: courage = ongoing chosen tether to self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early; patterned elision (“veiled ridgeway… shoreline lullaby”) paid off in closure cadence. Syntax mirrors breath-control under stress: long clauses calm, fragments absent. Perceptual signature sharp: Elara notices scent, texture, sound before abstractions. No head-hops, tense stable, diction within pilgrim lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: sentence length modulates with terrain; no template cadence detected. High density—every image does two jobs (mood + foreshadow, e.g., “distant sea” = future shore). Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors tone and metaphor; final line sonic callback. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar ‘mystic pilgrimage’ frame but freshened by making the path’s indirectness the functional mechanism of self-revelation, not backdrop. Ticket-punch branding repurposes mundane tool into talisman via micro-myth. Transformation test passed: swap names and story collapses because ridgeway indirection + star sigil are materially tied to theme. Risk in quiet ending paid off.</comment>
