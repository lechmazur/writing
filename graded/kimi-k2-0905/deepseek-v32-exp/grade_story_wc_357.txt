<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s curiosity about resilience is stated early and his actions track, yet interiority is generic (“his stomach lurched,” “he felt a pull”) rather than specific-to-him. No contradictory impulses or visible flaw complicate his steady competence, so the climax risks epiphany rather than earned shift. Still, the arrow-tip micro-choice under gravity flip shows micro-agency and a cost—he risks drifting helpless—so the arc lands solidly if not dangerously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: inversion → drift → arrow find → echo chamber → knowledge gained, each beat because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arrow tip becomes “symbol of connection” and Kaelen’s mandate to “share this discovery” forecloses retreat with social cost implied. Orientation anchors within 120 words; lens holds. Minor slack: the arrow’s exact causal trigger of the echoes is asserted rather than shown, a hairline break.</comment>

<comment>Veridia’s floating arches, inverted river, and glowing moss are vividly sketched and filter through Kaelen’s pilot gaze. The anti-grav skiff and quartz-glint stone act as tactile tools that constrain steering choices under inversion. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment charges the final image: the upward spiral pool mirrors the earlier ribbon river, reweighting the discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the resilience source—tightens when gravity flip opens a one-hour window, forcing passive drift and arrow retrieval. Cost is visible: risking loss of control, then accepting responsibility to disseminate knowledge. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversal after the echo reveal, yet options are reweighted. The hourglass pressure is tracked (“as the gravity inversion neared its end”), keeping tension alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Resilience emerges as dynamic process, not trait—shown via saplings exploding into maturity. The broken arrow motif reprises ancient stewardship vs. present custodianship, inviting reflection on cyclic responsibility without moralizing. Theme stays implicit, carried by image rather than thesis statement. Ambiguity lingers: will sharing nurture or exploit the loop?—a credible counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Kaelen; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is light but present—he reads currents, quartz gleams, root tangles as pilot, not tourist. Syntax is serviceable, occasionally lyrical (“whirling silence”), rhythm modulates with inversion lull. No dialogue to test, register consistent. Texture could sharpen further under peak pressure but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, largely free of loops; only minor scaffold (“the world flipped… Then, the world flipped” echo). Metaphors stay physical and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is good: one sentence often layers sensory cue + world rule + emotional filter. Tense stable, paragraph cuts tight. Final image (“guided by water and wonder”) risks slight sentimental lift but is earned by prior water navigation motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Gravity-flip orchard is fresh, and using arrow as key rather than weapon subverts trope. Synthesis of eco-archive “echoes” with accelerated growth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: passive drift protagonist in quiet SF; coherence holds. Could push deeper into biotech implication, but within 800 words the angle is distinct and memorable.</comment>
