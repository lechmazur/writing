<comment>Elara’s vocation and lineage fuse into one propulsive motive; her “gently thorough” nature is shown through micro-choices (steeping the locket, sensory note-taking) rather than labels. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through archivist reflexes—time, ink, fragility—so the haunted euphoria is embodied, not named. The final endurance (leaving the doomed jetty after re-forging its covenant) costs her a literal piece of herself, satisfying the visible-cost test. The lone absence is a second on-page character to pressure status, but the self-as-crucible arc still earns its renunciation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jetty will be demolished, yet the covenant’s reborn aura reframes loss into continuity. The locket-light payoff is anchored in the first third, returns at exact cost (ink, time, memory bleed), and reweights the premise—stories, not boards, now persist. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of jasmine, salt, walnut ink, and photo essence accrue until the night itself becomes archive. No orientation debt; micro-causality (grandmother’s rescue) seeds the macro turn without outline chatter.</comment>

<comment>Jetty-as-body functions as tool: splintered planks, salt-slick grain, and night-blooms constrain where Elara can crouch, steep, and write. Sensory hierarchy is archivist—visual fades first, touch and scent dominate—so every jasmine breath or silver chill is also data. Spatial choreography is flawless: satchel, bowl, ink bottle, locket move in clean sequence with no teleporting props. The blooming twilight itself charges the final image, glowing as the covenant’s new parchment.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save memory from erasure—faces a visible tightening: council vote → demolition clock → ink ritual before night ends. Agency is archivist, not activist; her power is attention and inscription, so the “turn” is internal (accepting demolition while preserving meaning). Cost is felt: locket subsumed, photo irreversibly altered, personal memory ghosted into public air. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; no false reversals or coincidences intrude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of small moments into immortal covenant; no character ever moralizes. Walnut ink, jasmine petals, and salt fuse into a non-literal answer: destruction can coexist with permanence if witness is thorough enough. Subtext lives in gesture—the silent sip of ink by silver, the tremor of blooms when covenant sparks—rather than thesis lines. Final image of Elara “vanishing into the night” hands the resonance to reader, inviting reflection on what we choose to archive before loss.</comment>

<comment>Voice is distilled archivist: diction of parchment, steeping, ledger, covenant; syntax lengthens during cataloguing beats then fractures at moment of illumination. Perceptual signature—time scored in fading photographs and darkening ink—never slips into generic lyric. Compression is taught early (“preserve the weight of small moments”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so register mismatch risk waived; free indirect style stays clean, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with variable sentence lengths, no template cadence; metaphor vehicles (ink drinking memory, jasmine breathing back) remain internally consistent. High density achieved—single sentences fold scent, history, and threat together. No loops or synonym churn; “haunted euphoria” appears once, earned by scene rather than repeated. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motifs, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of archival craft + magical realism feels fresh; walnut-ink as memory emulsion is not stock trope. Transformation test passed: swap “archivist” for activist and entire plot crumbles. Risk of quiet, contemplative stakes in flash-length piece is embraced and vindicated by lyrical closure. One minor echo of “night-blooming jasmine” as nostalgic cue is familiar, but local specificity (jetty planks, salt, silver locket) rescues it from cliché.</comment>
