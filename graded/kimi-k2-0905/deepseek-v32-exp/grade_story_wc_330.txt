<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The carpenter’s quiet persistence is shown through tactile, rhythmic work; singing emerges as a credible, costly breach of lifelong silence. Interiority is concrete (“his hands spoke in whittles and polishes”). No second character, so relationship crucible is waived; Earned Stasis lands with visible cost—his voice, the halo’s glow, the reclaimed horses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the once-silent man sings, the halo glows steady, the train becomes cradle not tomb—cost is felt in the broken silence and glowing fragment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet→sound→light reweights stakes. No orientation debt; space/time anchored early. Persistent constraint (his silence) shapes tactics until the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool (halo fragment) constrain choices: the fragment literally guides rebuild and finally crowns the carousel. Peeling circus cars, misting hush, and wind-bell chimes filter through carpenter’s priors—sound and wood and metal. Spatial choreography clean as he moves car-to-car; weather (mist) affects visibility and tempo. Micro-setting (the brass halo) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence birth living art? Pressure tightens when dismantled horses “plead” and halo fragment demands reassembly; singing is the irreversible cost. Accumulative escalation: each polished gear and smoothed mane increases density until song breaks the pattern. No coincidence; agency pure. Price paid: voice reclaimed, solitude broken—visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence not as lack but as canvas; restoration as self-restoration. Subtext in gesture—first touch of brass, last steady glow. Final image reweights “misting hush” into clean bright quiet, implying creation needs both silence and sound. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to carpenter’s perceptual filter: “hands spoke in whittles,” “whispering gleam.” Rhythm mirrors hush→chime→song arc. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Patterned elision (“hours bled away”) taught early and paid off in final cadence. Diction stays within taciturn woodworker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is compressed and rhythmic, high information density; sentences vary in length to echo quiet vs. release. Only minor scaffold: “misting hush” repeated twice without new charge, −0.2. No metaphor clashes, no filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud ear test passes. Final line lands on image that recharges wind-bell motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Abandoned-circus-train carousel restoration is fresh; silence-to-song arc avoids cliché by grounding in tactile carpentry. Risk: lyric accumulation could feel precious, but specificity of brass halo fragment and grandfather melody saves it. Transformation test: swap carpenter for poet and story collapses—voice and hand-tools are essential. Not radically avant-garde, but synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
