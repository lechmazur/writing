<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic gift and her mission to “certify wonder” are vivid, but interiority stays safely lyrical; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice ever threatens her resolve, so the climax feels pre-ordained rather than personally costly. The absence of a live opposition or risk flattens the arc into pure affirmation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amber sheet clears and the cavern silence is “forever altered,” a legible before/after. Causality is soft—aurora + sculptor’s chime arrive as coincidence—yet the pattern is taught early and holds under an Accumulative lens; cost is present but diffuse (the relic is spent, the hush is filled).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern, prism-songs, and synesthetic spectra are rendered with tactile economy; the sculpted hush functions as a micro-setting that constrains acoustics and timing. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elara’s perception without stalling momentum, and the final image of glowing ice walls recharges the opening palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (“certify wonder as essential”) but never tested by opposition or possible failure; pressure escalates only through atmospheric intensification, not through narrowed options or risk. The beat sequence is accumulative beauty rather than causal conflict, so the climax feels inevitable, not earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-necessity emerges through sensory spectacle and the emptied amber page, avoiding explicit moral. The reconfiguration is felt when silence “remembers song,” a resonant image that reweights the premise without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s synesthetic gaze; diction (“oscillating repose,” “river of audible color”) is consistent, rhythmic, and purposeful. No head-hop or register drift; voice modulates with auroral crescendo without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, propel forward, and carry double duty (image + motion). Occasional poetic stack (“breath-taking tapestry of emotions and hues”) edges toward purple but occurs post-climax where breathing space is allowed; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringer freeing music from amber via aurora fusion is fresh, and the sculptor’s distant chisel as synchronous creation spark is an elegant cross-cut. Risk is aesthetic rather than narrative; the concept dazzles but could transplant to another frozen temple without structural fracture.</comment>
