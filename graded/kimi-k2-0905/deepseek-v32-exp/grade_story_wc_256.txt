<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensuous—“calloused fingers,” “golden shadows” washing her skin—yet her want stays abstract: “texture of connection” is never pinned to a memory or object she risks losing. The lab’s acoustic rules shape her micro-choices (re-angles the miner’s lens, re-tunes the crystalline bell), so agency is embodied, but the stakes plateau; no second tightening forces her to pay with time, pride, or breakage. The earned stasis at the end feels gentle rather than costly because the story never threatens her access to the sounds; the revelation lands as insight, not irrevocable trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mosaic structure (four phased “bell-ring” shards) is taught early and cleanly transitioned with cadence echoes (“each chime a step”). Closure is a Charged Poise: the atrium becomes a living organ, meaning re-weighted, cost felt in the shift from archive to pulse. Causality holds under Accumulative lens; however, the final shard could sharpen the price (e.g., one bell hairline cracks, discarding a timbre forever) to push past 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The miner's lens functions as micro-setting: its scratched glass, “ground smooth by forgotten hands,” re-anchors every beat. Spatial choreography is exact—lens angles, resonance chambers, ribbon-like sonic light—so the reader always knows body-to-object distance. Golden shadows evolve from ambient tint to pulsating listener, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to touch and hearing, matching Elara’s vocation; no visual tourism overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is declared, but pressure is cognitive rather than visceral; no bell refuses to sing, no outside auditor threatens shutdown. The single meaningful tightening arrives when Elara pivots the lens outward, but consequences stay acoustic, not tactical; cost is observation, not forfeiture. Escalation plateaus; hence, just under 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: preservation becomes participation; sound needs living context. Subtext resides in the lens’s re-purposing—illumination tool becomes acoustic bridge—so meaning is shown, not stated. The final shimmer of “audible light” offers resonant re-pricing without sermon. Avoids echoing the prompt’s wording; no thematic thesis stated aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmic—“prism-song bell ringer,” “golden shadows” refrain—taught in first 120 words and held to last line. Perceptual signature is specific to sonic craft: Elara notices fracture lines in light spectra, fingertips read alloy grain. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Occasional poetic cascade (“auditory light”) risks overwriting, but pattern is consistent and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; long breath-blasts simulate resonance, then clipped fragments mark micro-adjustments. No loops or synonym churn; “golden shadows” returns with accruing weight, not padding. One mixed metaphor—“ribbon of color and tone”—survives, but it is brief and early, so closure untouched. High density: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-grid-stability world + acoustic archaeology + miner’s lens retooled for sound is non-obvious. Concept of “artificial pilgrimage” literalized as engineered acoustic path feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causality. Could push 9.0+ if one bell cracked irreparably, adding material consequence to conceptual turn.</comment>
