<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his boot scuff, the patch’s weight in-pocket—but his “rapid adapting” is reported more than dramatized; we watch him shift stance, not cognition. The final moment crystallizes a believable renunciation (he leaves with the patch and a storm of prevention), so motivation earns its cost. Still, no contradiction under pressure is shown inside one beat; the micro-choice that forecloses path is the quiet pocketing, not a visible tactical trade-off. Competent, affecting, but not yet razor-deep.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patch becomes vigilance, silence becomes warning, and Elias’s walking away carries the felt cost of bearing future disasters. Causality is clean—wind survey → pattern recognition → convergence understood—under an Accumulative/Textural lens whose density tightens at the final image. One minor scaffold: “the silence felt different” repeats the opening beat sans new pressure. Orientation is secure by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Container labyrinth, grime, rust-streaks, wayward draft: selective sensory triage filtered through investigator’s professional gaze. Wind patterns are not backdrop but tactical intelligence that will constrain future flight paths. Spatial choreography is crisp—corridors, clearing, wreck scar—no floating geography. Environment is literally the antagonist; removing it collapses stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode wind to prevent repeat crash—signals early and tightens when the patch personalizes the abstract loss. One meaningful deepening: vortices pictured colliding with Kael’s patch-wearing arm. Cost is conceptual (lifelong vigilance) rather than on-page resource loss; still legible under Accumulative lens. Could use one visible micro-loss (time, tool, data) to enter 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: foresight as moral burden, not safety slogan. Patch reweights from souvenir to mandate without authorial sermon. Silence motif shifts from eerie to instructive, supplying quiet dread that lingers after close. Avoids tidy moral; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person tight sustains investigator’s technician diction—“anemometer,” “vortices,” “metallic canyon”—without slipping into manual-speak. Rhythm accelerates through shorter clauses as wind howls, mirroring bodily adjustment. No filter-verb stacks; perception stays embodied. Voice distinct enough; not yet idiosyncratic enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Concrete nouns predominate—“rust-streaked walls,” “shred of plastic.” One paraphrase loop: “silence…smothering…silence” in para 1 & 17; minor. Figurative language sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar, clear prop tracking; high information density with momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: crash-site wind forensics as emotional crucible. Container-labyrinth as aerodynamic wind-tunnel feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes—lonely investigator, talismanic patch—are grounded through tactile specificity. Risk level moderate; could have pushed weirder structure, but coherence valued over gimmick.</comment>
