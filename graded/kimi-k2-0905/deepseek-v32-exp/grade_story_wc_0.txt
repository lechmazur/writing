<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific to Aris’s scientific lens, but the emotional arc is largely observational—no contradictory impulse forces a costly micro-choice. The “kindled humility” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture. earns stasis is credible, yet the cost feels abstract because the story never threatens her with any concrete loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the greenhouse becomes an “active site of becoming,” a Conceptual Repricing that reframes ruin as process. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns reweight the stake—and the final cadence shift is felt. Cost is conceptual but legible in the last image. Minor waiver: orientation (who-where-when) is deliberately late (~130 w), yet the disorientation serves the closing payoff, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the butterfly-wing scale functions as both environment and tool, constraining attention and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Aris’s astrophysicist bias—she clocks “microscopic scars” and “iridescent dust” before emotion. Spatial tracking of glass shards and settling dust remains coherent. The greenhouse is not backdrop but apparatus, evolving beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—strip drama from catastrophe—is declared early and reiterated, yet pressure escalates only by accretion, not by narrowing options. No live dilemma or trade-off is ever staged; the protagonist’s stance merely deepens. Conceptual cost is present in the final reframe, but the lack of a tested commitment keeps this below 8-band. One meaningful tightening occurs, but it is tonal, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: gradualism dissolves tragedy into process. The butterfly-scale’s slow burial by dust enacts the concept without sermon. The closing image reweights “decay” as elegance, achieving resonant reconfiguration. No explicit moralizing—ambiguity lingers, inviting contemplation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is sharply particular: the neutron-star mind sees “city-sized spheres of unimaginable density” beside a fleck of wing-dust. Syntax is precise, rhythmic, compressed—scientific diction never drifts into textbook dryness. Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hop. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. Final paragraph cadence mirrors pulsar spin-down, a quiet sonic payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density, no scaffold loops, varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language is sparse, accurate—“mud-smeared glass and shattered dreams” risks cliché but is instantly redeemed by the next scientific clause. No simultaneity errors or mixed metaphors. Minor −0.2 for one “stock” pairing (“shattered dreams”) that momentarily slackens texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of astrophysical cognition with post-flood ecological micro-time feels fresh and inevitable. Risk is taken: a plotless accumulative structure that trusts dust to carry stakes. Transformation test passes—this interior could not be transplanted to another profession. Slight proximity echo to Dillard’s “death of a moth” is acknowledged but subverted through scientific flattening of tragedy.</comment>
