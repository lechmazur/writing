<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to quantify emotion while drowning in borrowed selves—remains vivid; the embodied grief/joy collision is a sharp beat. Her final renunciation (locking the cooled fragment away) is foreshadowed by her ink-stained fingers and the press’s lock-like click, so the cost lands. Yet the “mathematics of emotion” motive stays abstract; no concrete equation or failed formula ever appears on the page, blunting the sense of a live intellectual stake. The stoic cartographer’s loneliness is the only borrowed trait that alters her spatial perception, so most imprints feel interchangeable rather than tactical.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass through the press thickens the emotional density until the final sheet strips ambiguity away, a clean pattern break. Causality is interior but legible—because she keeps feeding personalities in, therefore the fragment finally feeds on her. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the halo fragment reweights from tool to mirror, making the cost (her own essence lost and returned) undeniable. The vanished stars and first dawn bracket the action cleanly; orientation is never in doubt.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz dome and ink-slick press constrain every motion; the fragment’s iridescence literally colors the walls, charging the final image when its glow dies. Night-sky orientation is economical—fading stars serve as a live clock that tightens the frame. Spatial choreography holds: the press, bench, drawer, and Elara’s hands stay tracked without drift. Workshop texture is specific to visual and tactile senses; sound (lock-click) is used only twice, keeping the beat spare.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will she survive her own experiment—escalates as each sheet increases emotional turbulence; the fragment’s brightening is an objective correlative for rising risk. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cartographer’s loneliness warps the walls, foreclosing the option of safe detachment. Cost is paid on the page: trembling hands, spatial hallucination, and the final extraction of her own essence. No coincidence or external rescue dilutes the pressure; the risk is self-inflicted and self-settled.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the impossibility of mapping feeling onto numbers is shown through the literal stacking of voices until meaning collapses into a single legible line. The shifted meaning of “deliberate ambiguity”—from method to enemy—creates a quiet irony that reconfigures prior material. No moral is asserted; the drawer’s click is an Earned Stasis that forecloses further experiment. The final image of cooled glass reframes the quest as vanity, leaving a concrete emotional aftereffect of emptied clarity.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: ink, starlight, and metallic press clicks filter through Elara’s precision-obsessed gaze. Syntax modulates from long liquid sentences under starlight to staccato clauses (“She pressed on”) as pressure peaks. No head-hopping; fragment glow and wall breathing are sensed strictly through her skin. Free indirect style is clean: “the mathematics she sought remained elusive” carries her own diction without filter-verb clutter.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—lock-click, halo light—none contradict prior physics. Rhythm breathes with the press strokes; no template cadence or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new rule (“now just a cool piece of glass”) with propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses alchemical letterpress with neuroscience of empathy, a synthesis not seen in familiar templates. The trope of “borrowing personalities” is transformed into a tactile printing process that leaves ink under fingernails, not mere metaphor. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than external antagonist, yet coherence holds. The final repricing feels inevitable: the fragment becomes mirror, not tool, a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>
