<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s “sacred duty” motive is declared repeatedly but never tested by an alternative desire; he drifts through discoveries without a visible fork or forfeiture. Micro-choices—tracing the dragon, activating the device—are present, yet they feel inevitable, not costly. The interior contradiction promised by “odd historian” never surfaces; he is competent, calm, unopposed. Still, the embodied emotion (“his heart beat a rhythm against the overwhelming stillness”) and tactile handling of relics keep him credibly perceptive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the axis is not physically restored but Elian’s perception realigns, charging the final “bronze quiet” with audible memory. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each relic beat layers density until the tapestry glows; the cost is the irreversibility of “no new dreams,” felt in the last line. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 5; no penalty. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction; the fireplace diaries function as taught pattern that pays off in the device activation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Immediately microlocates: “bronze quiet,” “concentric levels,” “heat-cracked stones,” all filtered through Elian’s archive-attuned eye. Silo curvature guides his spiral descent; the fireplace’s ash constrains how he handles pages, a tactile micro-setting. The tapestry is not merely seen—its threads encode celestial data, becoming the story’s pivot-tool. Final image recharges “bronze quiet” with voices now stored in stone, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost dream-capacity—is signaled early and deepens when Elian learns the axis shift severed dreams. Escalation is accumulative: each relic adds knowledge, tightening the cost of irreversibility. The decisive intensification arrives when the device activates and “stories flowed,” foreclosing any chance of new dreams; the price is legible. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and existential, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as memory versus erasure: “to collect the stories walls have heard” becomes an act of cosmic repair. The tapestry dragons shift from decoration to star-map, reweighting myth into science lost. No explicit moral is stated; the final glow lets the reader feel the fragile victory of archive over void. Subtext resides in the hush itself—silence not as emptiness but as saturated potential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrid, compressed diction—“bronze quiet,” “forgotten whispers”—teaches its pattern early and holds to the last line. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“He learned that the axis displacement had not just tilted the planet…”) then fractures into shorter beats at activation, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; single perceptual lens stays tight to Elian’s archive-senses. The elevated register is earned by the monkish, monk-scribe atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence adds archival or bodily detail without paraphrase. Metaphors are coherent—“brittle as autumn leaves” aligns with burnt diary ash. Information density is high: “diaries accounts of skies tearing and stars falling” delivers world-quake in nine words. Rhythm modulates from slow caesura of “bronze quiet” to the forward rush of “stories flowed,” propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The post-dream planetary hush, relic librarian, and star-map tapestry synthesize into a singular vision. Familiar tropes—post-apocalypse, monk-scholar, axis tilt—are re-encoded via archival sense-data rather than exposition dump. Risky lyric compression is fully committed to and pays off in the final humming hush. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh in execution.</comment>
