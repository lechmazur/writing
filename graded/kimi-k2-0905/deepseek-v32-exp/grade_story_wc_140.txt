<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s drive to reconstruct an erased identity is vivid and embodied; his tactile handling of the poison label and the visceral recall of arsenic’s taste show interiority without label-speak. Micro-choices—crouching between containers, deciding which fragment to trust—escalate under rising stakes. The final stance (“a past but no future”) crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost. Flaw: late-onset interiority is more summary than scene, keeping the score just below 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the overheard name reweights every prior fragment, and the taste of arsenic charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—each tide-marked shard intensifies meaning rather than causal plot. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before the 120-word threshold via distinct container-and-tide cues. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and metaphor—paths physically dead-end as memories do. Tide levels dictate search tempo; slime on pilings mirrors the story’s submerged truths. “Metallic canyons” and “rusted steel boxes” are selective, POV-filtered, never tourist catalog. The poison label’s return as tactile relic charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he recover his authentic past?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the poison label reframes every fragment. Progression is accumulative: each overheard story rubs against the last, increasing density rather than causal reversals. Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of anonymity by accepting the arsenic memory. One meaningful deepening suffices under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of discarded voices: identity is a palimpsest of other people’s stories. No explicit thesis; meaning crystallizes when the poison taste reweights prior fragments. Ambiguity persists—he knows the crime yet remains officially dead—inviting reflection on erasure versus agency. Final image is conceptually repriced: “nameless in the world, but now vividly real to himself.”</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: corrugated steel as “layered potential,” tide breath as narrative metronome. Syntax elongates during contemplative beats, contracts when he crouches to listen, mirroring tide flow. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within a dock-level lexicon. Compression (“drifting ash,” “clerical ghost”) is patterned early and pays off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Varied sentence cadence mirrors tide inhale/exhale; no template churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“metallic canyons” never contradict container scale. One mixed image (“drifting ash” beside industrial port) is minor enough to keep below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar amnesia premise is inverted: memory is not lost but confiscated by bureaucracy and money. Container maze as external hard-drive of memory feels fresh and inevitable. Fragment-collecting mechanic turns eavesdropping into existential archaeology. Risk-taking—quiet accumulative arc rather than confrontational climax—heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
