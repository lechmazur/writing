<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “liberate trapped memories” is declared early and repeated, but the interior contradiction between skepticism and luminous calling is asserted, not dramatized. She makes only one high-stakes choice—aligning the box under the stars—and the cost (fatigue, doubt) is named rather than felt. The lack of embodied struggle under pressure keeps the arc functional but short of publishable complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the final alignment opens the box and water returns, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she surrenders her skepticism). Causality is causal-lite; each shard found is a because/therefore step, but the “how” of memory-transfer stays off-page. The lens holds, yet the missing mechanism caps credibility at 7.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Setting is the story’s engine: dry fountains, weak sun, smog-choked sky all filter through Elara’s priors and literally constrain her path. The micro-setting of the box-and-stars finale charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Occasional tourist-catalog listings (“narrow alleys… broad plazas”) nudge it back to 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—free the memories—escalates only by accumulation of shards; no live option is foreclosed until the final alignment, and even that is a first-time cost rather than a narrowing. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; sidereal patience is invoked, not weaponized. Enough for a functional arc, but not the tightening required for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as civic water, doubt as prism. The return of water re-prices the city’s past without a stated moral. A late echo of “luminous skeptic” nudges toward thesis, but the image of flowing fountains mostly earns its resonance, keeping the score mid-high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s prism-filtered perception; “luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience,” etc. are compressed into rhythmic, patterned diction. No head-hops, no register drift. The voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough to feel inseparable from this narrator alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentences vary and propel. A few scaffold phrases (“the box was heavy… the box felt light”) and stacked metaphors (“mind a prism,” “city sighed”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat, so the prose stays above the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The memory-fountain equation feels fresh; the star-alignment unlock is a risk that pays off visually. Yet the quest structure is fairy-tale familiar, and “luminous skeptic” remains more label than lived paradox. Specificity of city and box elevates, but template quest bones remain visible.</comment>
