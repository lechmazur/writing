<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is fluid and character-specific; “storm-born silence” perceptual signature anchors Elara’s designer mind. Motivation stays consistent—guard creative space—and the seed catalyzes a believable creative pivot. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized; decision path is solitary and friction-free, so cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, the renunciation of corporate buy-out is legible and scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seed arrival → orthogonal ideation → new room concept → safeguard business. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—seed reframed from threat to sanctuary cornerstone—visible in “She would design a room where players must nurture the seed to ‘bloom’.” Orientation clear by line 3; no teleport props. Mild causality gap: corporate threat is recalled, not foregrounded, so cost is intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nocturnal brook, mossy stone, damp earth—selective sensory triad mirrors quiet ideation. Micro-setting functions: brook’s “flow” patterns the puzzle structure she envisions. Setting never constrains a live choice, so 9-band gate fails; seed is the object that charges closure, not environment. Still, atmosphere is vivid, consistent, and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is declared early and re-asserted at recall of buy-out threat. Escalation is accumulative: each orthogonal angle thickens the conceptual solution rather than narrowing live options. No on-page loss, tool, or price is risked; tension remains prospective. Hence pressure tightens intellectually but never viscerally; cost is prospective, not paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—creation within constraint—emerges from seed-to-escape-room transmutation, not lecture. Final image of “sanctuary for creativity” offers resonant re-pricing of corpse flower’s foul bloom as metaphor for disruptive art. Avoids tidy moral; complexity acknowledged in “hidden potential within constraints.” No motif recycling outside seed; brook silence is mood, not theme engine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature (“intricate puzzles,” “orthogonal approaches”) stays designer-centric. Rhythm varies from brook-long sentences to staccato “Could this seed be connected?” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stable, though “orthogonal approaches” edges into corporate register; justified by character occupation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences multitask atmosphere, interiority, plot. No loops or scaffold; “storm-born silence” repeated twice with purpose. Metaphors clean (“canvas for her ideas”). Final paragraph compresses days of labor into three lines—strategic telling that propels rather than stalls. Ear-test rhythm natural; paragraph lengths varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise—mysterious corpse-flower seed as creative catalyst—is non-obvious and specific to escape-room subculture. Synthesis of botanic rarity with puzzle design feels inevitable in hindsight. Corpse-flower stench repurposed as thematic bloom of daring art—fresh inflection. Risk taken: quiet contemplative arc over dramatic confrontation; coherence maintained.</comment>
