<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied patience and the contradiction between volatile alchemy and deliberate motion are vividly shown through micro-choices (arranging shards in spirals, lighting flash-paper with chapped hands). The interior drive “to translate heartbeats into maps” is anchored to tactile ritual, so the final sealing feels earned. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The slight reserve from 9+ is that the cost (cold, time, personal risk) is named but not dramatized in a way that visibly alters later tactics; it’s felt, yet not compounded into a visible mistake or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the plate now “pulsed softly” while the orchard exhales—an undeniable reweighting of the stillness premise. Accumulative lens holds: each flash-paper ignition deepens pattern density until starlight is irreversibly fused; causality is internal to ritual logic, not external event chains. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at line ~6 (“deep in the subarctic crater”). Persistent cost—patience, cold, stored starlight spent—shapes every beat and is literally consumed in the final sealing; no contradiction under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crater orchard, crystal vial, flash-paper, and silver plate are handled with sensory specificity that constrains action (cold limits dexterity, vial must be unstoppered with gloved fingers). Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling in snow, items arrayed in spirals, distance to dead trees tracked. Environment charges the final image: the breeze that rises after sealing is causally tied to released energy, not decorative. Micro-setting cap at 8.8 applies because no single prop forces a tactical fork, but every environmental detail tightens the ritual; still, strong band criteria met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a map of heartbeats be fixed before the world exhales—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each ignition heightens stillness, consumes starlight, and increases the visible price (hands numbing, vial emptying). One decisive tightening: the final ignition fuses the last drop, foreclosing reversal. Cost is legible (stored light is gone, cold has entered bones), but because the orchard itself doesn’t push back or threaten failure, external pressure stays muted; thus just below 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: discarded fragments and silent heartbeats become guides for the lost. The orchard’s shift from decay to memory-site reweights stillness without overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture—spiral patterns, flash-flare, final wrapped plate—never in thesis lines. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: is the soft pulse beacon or burden? Complexity lingers without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a hushed, patient cadence that mirrors Elara’s ritual; diction (“gnarled,” “volatile transformations,” “moving stillness”) is consistent and POV-appropriate. No dialogue, so those bullets waived. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments during ignition flares—intentional modulation. Perceptual signature is strongly biased toward tactile cold and faint light. No head-hop or register drift; minor repetition of “stillness” is thematic, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Highly tactile, image-driven sentences carry double duty (atmosphere + causality). Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing; no template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed-image risk—“moving stillness”—is deliberately oxymororic and pays off at closure, so exempt. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she began/she lit” could compress, but propulsion is intact. Closure line is crisp and resonant. Within hair of 9.0; no artifact touches the sealing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Flash-paper alchemy + starlight cartography is a fresh synthesis; heartbeats-to-map is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Subarctic orchard as ritual studio particularizes setting. Patience-as-physical-discipline reverses typical action-hero alchemy. Risk—quiet lyric ending in a crater of dead trees—pays off through charged poise. Only hedge: emotional arc is interior; swapping “apple orchard” for another dead biome might technically work, but the frost-bitten specificity resists generic transfer more than most.</comment>
