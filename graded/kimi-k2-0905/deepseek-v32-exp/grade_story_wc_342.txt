<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The face-blind portraitist is a sharp, generative flaw: it powers her tactile search for the warm-spined safe and forces her to “feel” the sky rather than name it. Contradictory impulses (capture vs. release) coexist in the same beats, and her final renunciation—accepting the sky’s unframeability—carries visibly scaled cost as the demolition growl enters. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied in finger-on-spine and brush-in-pigment. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and fractal recursion intensifies density until the mural’s static beauty itself proves the sky can’t be possessed. The “click” of the safe and the coin-alignment are tidy micro-turns that pay off the guild legend without breaking causality. Closure is a Charged Poise: she steps back, brush still wet, as the first demolition rumble reweights all prior effort into conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The hollowed tree-library is evoked through lived motion—curved shelves, oak-ink scent, lectern compartment—rather than postcard catalog. Micro-setting objects (warm-spined book, crystalline lenses, crushed quartz) constrain tactics: she chooses them, grinds them, refracts light through them. Spatial choreography is clean; the safe opens at a reachable lectern, never teleporting. Weather enters only at the end when the external sky survives, sharpening the thematic counter-image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—imprison the boundless—tightens as each fractal layer proves the sky’s infinite recursion can’t be held. One meaningful deepening: the moment she sees her own mural as “a static, beautiful lie” forecloses further brushstrokes. Cost is legible: months of pigment labour now doomed alongside the building. Agency remains hers; the demolition machinery only ratifies her renunciation, not rescues it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges only through particulars: fractal pigment, warm spine, crystalline lenses. The final image—sky outside alive, mural inside dead—reconfigures the premise without moralizing. No late abstraction declares “art has limits”; instead the limit is felt when the mural’s shimmer freezes. Resonant reprice: the infinite is valuable precisely because it refuses capture, a wisdom earned by the failed attempt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close narration keeps perceptual signature consistent: shapes, textures, warmth, scent—never faces. Syntax breathes with brush-stroke cadence; longer sentences during layering, staccato during coin-alignment. No head-hopping; knowledge stays strictly Elara-bound. Register remains within an artist’s tactile lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances texture or stakes. No filler loops, no synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “shimmer reflecting not just color but the very movement of stars” charges the closure image. Opening and final lines anchor voice and reverb cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Face-blind muralist who paints the sky inside a doomed tree-library is a fresh synthesis; the paradox of capturing limitlessness via infinite detail feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—conceptual rather than plot twist—pays off: the mural succeeds visually yet fails existentially. No stock tropes; guild legend, coin-lock, and crystalline lenses are retooled as tactile tools, not fantasy props.</comment>
