<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s lone, sustained POV is sharply particular: her fingers clutch a humidity-soft program, her throat hums a dead composer’s phrase, her thighs push through chest-high water—each micro-choice is embodied, urgent, and tied to the ghost-code stake. The “lately inspired” trait is more label than lived contradiction, but her visible shiver when water stains bloom into notes shows authentic intrusion of awe under pressure. The final slapped-water percussion is a credible renunciation of silence that forecloses her prior observer role; cost is felt in the soaked program she still carries. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status tests waive; interiority alone carries the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost’s smile and steadying lanterns reconfigure the house from haunted to memorial, with undeniable conceptual cost—she inherits an untranscribable legacy. Causal lattice holds: water-drop → stain → map → slap → release, each because/therefore linkage tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“chest-high water”), well inside 120-word guardrail. No lens ambiguity; progression is strictly causal. Persistent constraint—the ruined violin she lifts—shapes the final image and signals the price of transmission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house is not backdrop but tactical terrain: every wade, ripple, and echoing drip constrains movement and timing. The flickering lanterns double as unstable reading light and ghost spotlight, charging the final calm glow. The antique program’s evolving stains act as micro-setting that literally rewrites the score she must play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—half-drowned piano, submerged seats, black pit—bodies and objects stay tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s silence—signals early and tightens once: the water-stain map forces her into the pit, narrowing safe observation to risky contact. Escalation is single but decisive; the slap renounces passive reading and triggers the spectral response. Cost is legible in soaked paper and the unplayable violin she now shoulders. No off-stage rescue; the beat is entirely her agency under rising water and time pressure of fading light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art out of ruin, composition inside destruction. Motif of “in between spaces” is not stated but dramatized—rests, pauses, waterline, silence—culminating in the final memorial reclassification. No moralizing; the closing image of her carrying the sodden program offers resonant, non-literal answer to how dead art stays alive. Subtext in gesture (ghost’s nod) rewards reflection without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions: “she felt a chill, as if the ghost approved” keeps knowledge character-bound. Diction—“plink,” “slack and swollen,” “unstruck chords”—is sensorily precise and musically idiomatic. Rhythm mirrors action: long sentences for slow wading, staccato fragments for lantern flickers. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and metaphor—“water dripped…with a soft plink” layers sound, atmosphere, and ticking clock. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative control tight: “chest-high water” literal yet metaphorically baptismal; no mixed metaphors. Minor over-modifier in “unstable light reflecting off the dark, stagnant surface,” but clarity intact. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—flooded opera house as living score—is fresh yet inevitable; ruins-as-manuscript concept reweights familiar ghost-story frame. Specificity of orchestral rest/pause iconography prevents swap-out with generic haunted theatre. Risk in lyric, wordless closure is earned by prior sensory patterning. No derivative echoes; the ghost composer trope is inverted—he wants release, not revenge. Final image of musician carrying spoiled violin feels non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
