<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Kaelen’s “jaded sight” and Elara’s “pure heart” are stated rather than embodied; the only embodied beat is her trembling fingers. The interior contradiction is asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final transfer of the pearl makes sense but the personal cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave’s song now reaches the villages, a visible reweighting of the premise. Causality is cleanly accumulative: Elara’s memory-focus → pearl-flare → rain-mist → village magic. Orientation is crisp in first 60 words; only one transition (surface→depth). The lack of foreseen cost on Kaelen slightly blunts the “earned” test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cave geometry is tracked cleanly: mouth → crystals → deep orb; bodies never float. Crystals are used as both light-source and sound-source, pressing choices (Kaelen rises when timbre changes). The “bright darkness” tone is sustained via shimmer-rain that is both luminous and shadow-casting. Pearl-as-micro-setting constrains the final gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is signaled early and escalates through one visible tightening: the mist-downpour that proves amplification works. Cost is present but light: Kaelen’s relinquished control, Elara’s permanent binding; both stated more than felt. Agency sits with Elara’s memory-choice; Kaelen’s clairvoyant failure complicates but does not raise on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the unseen is not to be predicted but partnered, shown through overlapping shadows that bloom into guiding spirits. Final image—village flowers glowing—reweights “mundane” into miraculous without moral tag. Ambiguity remains: chaos and beauty are co-equal. The only echo risk is the “bright darkness” phrase itself, which is repeated rather than deepened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Kaelen until hand-off to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is present—“notes weaving into complex, unfamiliar tune”—yet voice occasionally drifts into abstract register (“steadily unpredictable nature”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: short sentences during flare, longer cadence for reflection. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext of surrender.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence runs. Mixed-metaphor risk (“symphony of light and sound”) is acceptable because pattern is taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop: “magnify everyday magic” / “magnify the faint magic” within 40 words costs −0.2. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or stakes. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant who fails because purity, not foresight, unlocks amplification. Musical cave plus overlapping shadows as portal method feels specific to this world. Transformation test passes—generic fantasy names would collapse the resonance. Risk of “pilgrim + crystal cave” trope is offset by renunciation ending rather than power gain. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
