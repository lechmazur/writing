<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“jaded wonder,” “delicately robust”—but emotion stays abstract; no bodily contradiction under pressure. The final beat lands because the baseball’s return forces memory and empathy simultaneously, yet prior beats merely label states (“he felt a fragile empathy growing”) without embodied friction. One decisive micro-choice—throwing the ball—has to carry the arc; more prior stakes-testing choices would deepen credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: catching the ball reweights the past as lesson, not burden, cost legible in the phrase “delicately robust, able to withstand the weight.” Causal chain holds: newspaper clue → descent → throw → return → empathy rekindled. Orientation anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. No meaningful tightening mid-lake; escalation is linear, not recursive, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake is not postcard scenery; its shifting glow directly mirrors/options Leo’s moral pulse, constraining each step. Micro-anchor baseball serves as portable setting fragment, seams carrying eras that charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—damp air, pulsing light—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—kindle empathy—signaled early; pressure tightens when the mirrored self refuses reply, making acceptance of past the only forward path. Cost visible: he must re-inherit memories he came to erase. Agency drives turn: the throw activates the lake’s reply. No secondary reversal; linear escalation sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: stains, echoes, reflections, light—ending re-prices “dirty past” as necessary soil for empathy. No explicit thesis; final line leaves resonance—“light remained within”—without moralizing. Subtext of debt unpaid (baseball) quietly parallels emotional debt to victims. Ambiguity accepted: no guarantee he can transplant empathy topside.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Leo’s perceptual filter: “jaded wonder” colors every notice. Syntax mirrors hesitation—clause-laden, slightly breathless—then shortens at the throw. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Free-indirect diction consistent; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence length varies with footing on stone path. Occasional loft—“ethereal light,” “fluid maze”—but metaphor domain coherent. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed moment: “delicately robust” is reused rather than re-imaged, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-wipe + empathy-seed is familiar, but underground bioluminescent moral mirror-lake feels fresh, and baseball-from-time-traveler converts SF trope into intimate totem. Synthesis makes the combination inseparable from Leo’s arc. Could swap names, yet lake-test and artifact remain specific enough to resist full abstraction.</comment>
