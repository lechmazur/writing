<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is vivid and embodied—every driftwood placement is a micro-choice under memory-loss pressure. Yet the interiority loops: “tidal longing” and “echo” abstractions repeat without new contradiction after the midpoint. The chalk snap is a crisp Earned Stasis, but the amnesia that follows erases the cost’s emotional residue a beat too cleanly. Still, his flaw drives every beat; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-thick repetitions of forgetting tighten the stake until the chalk-stub finale reweights the mission as ungraspable. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate disorientation pays off in the throne scene where purpose is surrendered. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the sound of growing older was in the forgetting and the seeking.” Cost is felt, but the beat is compressed into one sentence; a hair more embodied price would clinch 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fog sculptures act as mutable walls that force driftwood marking; garden geography is never vague—each marker is a tactile response to shifting mist. Videotapes and chalk ground the micro-setting; chalk’s wear tracks time on the body of the tool. The throne of “accumulated years” is the single image where environment, body, and theme converge—meets 9+ quick test but appears only at the end, so capped at 8.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; every driftwood arrow is an accumulative tightening that forecloses certainty. Pressure grows via attrition of memory rather than external antagonist; chalk stub becomes visible price. No single reversal, but the pattern of near-discovery → erasure → re-marking narrows options until surrender. Cost is legible, yet escalation is more iterative than decisive; hence mid-7 band.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative failure to crystallize time: “to capture the sound was to lose its essence.” No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise through renunciation. Echo, chalk, and videotape motifs accumulate texture rather than symbolic convenience. The insight feels earned because it is inseparable from the prophet’s physical exhaustion and snapped tool.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><question>Lyric, pattern-taught compression (“He clung to echoes…”) sustains a hypnotic cadence that mirrors fog-loop amnesia. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—details arrive as half-remembered glimmers. Register stays within the prophet’s plausible lexicon; only “precognitively forgetful” risks clinical diction but is immediately embodied. Rhythm breathes with pressure: shorter clauses surface at chalk-snap climax, then lengthen into serenety—clean 9- territory but for minor template stems (“the sound of growing older was…”).</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>High information density: each sentence layers fog, tool, and memory without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“echoes… echoes”) and two “the sound of growing older” repetitions nudge downward. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Final third is clean; artifacts do not touch closure. Strong read-aloud rhythm, but the iterative phrasing keeps it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Premise—amnesiac prophet mapping mist with driftwood to hear aging—feels non-obvious and inseparable from form. Risky accumulative structure could have collapsed into monotony, yet the fog grammar teaches the pattern early and pays off in the throne renunciation. Fresh inflection: chalk wear as biological clock. No derivative echoes; transformation is complete.</comment>
