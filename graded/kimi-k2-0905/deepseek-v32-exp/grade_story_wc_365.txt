<question>1</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—the ache to know versus the dread of what knowing will cost—are kept alive in every beat; the shard-touch jolt is embodied (pulse, breath, palm-heat), not labeled. The renunciation at the end—letting the shard fall—earns its poise because we’ve seen how fiercely he clung to every earlier fragment of possibility. Interiority stays strictly sensory-map idiom (“the gravitational pull of half-finished sentences”) rather than therapeutic gloss. No safety-hedging: the final silence is accepted, not softened.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bay solidifies, shard cools, truth now “woven into the map of his being”—cost is felt in the ache of that silence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (“cyclically spontaneous”) and paid off when surge peaks at the rift. Orientation clean by line 6. Causality intact: each universe-thread pull tightens the stakes until the mother-erasure vision forecloses retreat. No artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The derelict bay is not backdrop but instrument: residual engine-heat powers the weaving, skeleton hulls become the loom. Micro-setting supremacy—the shard itself—constrains every tactic: when it cools, the work ends. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across gravel, gantries, rift-center. Final image of cooling glow against dust recharges the motif with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—“the weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when each universe-thread makes the lie heavier. One meaningful deepening: mother’s starlight-stained hands erase herself; this vision narrows Kaelen’s options to acceptance only. Cost is legible: the bay’s silence after the rift is the vacuum left by her deletion. Agency remains his—he channels the bay’s energy—but the price is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of cartography: to map is to erase, to know is to lose. The glass shard first appears as discovery, last as discarded relic—its journey reweights knowledge from treasure to burden. No moralizing; the final silence lets the reader feel the vacuum. Subtext lives in gesture—hand opening to drop the shard—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent sensory-map diction: “intangible echoes,” “fabric of reality pliable,” “latent energy only he could feel.” Syntax lengthens during surges, fragments under peak pressure (“Then it snapped back”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Psychic distance compresses flawlessly: abstract “multiverse threads” collapse into the concrete clink of glass on dust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>High information density: “dusty gravel voiced his boots” does three jobs (sound, texture, forward motion). Rhythm breathes with the cycle—long sentences during surge, staccato when it snaps back. One mixed metaphor only (“timeless, nebulous state”) but it recovers immediately. No scaffold, no loops, no register drift. Clean copy; pronouns track through rift chaos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The sensory-map profession is not window dressing but the very mechanism of inter-world travel, turning a quaint concept into plot engine. Parallel-universe trope is inverted: the goal is not power but the cost of maternal erasure, giving fresh emotional stakes. Green shard as “key” could feel generic, yet its cooling equals the moment love’s burden is accepted—an inevitable reconfiguration in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic of alternate selves) pays off because closure stays legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
