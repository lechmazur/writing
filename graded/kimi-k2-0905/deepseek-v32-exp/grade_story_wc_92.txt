<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s calmly inventive trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming the quill, prying the panel—so we see contradiction-free action under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“the bronze quill holder felt heavy”) without label-speak. The arc is a credible renunciation: she accepts lifelong danger once the leaflets are planted, a cost foreshadowed by the “luminous stone” image. The single-POV lens is consistent; no secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final “winking hush” crystallizes both danger and promise, the cost being inevitable exposure. Causal lens holds: blackout → angle-read → armory breach → pamphlet seeding, each because/therefore link tight. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and never slips. One meaningful tightening—pamphlets now irrecoverably placed—fulfills Q4 escalation requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fort’s glow-to-dark shift is sketched sparsely but actively steers choice: blackout grants stealth, walls’ hum vanishes to silence, guiding Elara’s hush. Micro-setting (quill, sundial, armory wall) constrains tactics and reappears in the closing image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across courtyard → armory → quarters. Sensory economy favors sound and touch over visual, mirroring blackout urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed insurrection without detection—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when pamphlets are physically planted; live option (abort) is foreclosed. Agency is protagonist-driven at every beat; blackout coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: once leaflets are scattered, discovery becomes inevitable, a price Elara accepts in the final hush. No secondary reversal is needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: illumination can be subverted from within; stone-cradled sparks = ideas. Subtext resides in objects—quill as pen/lock-pick, sundial as compass of revolt—never explained aloud. Final “winking hush” reweights earlier “luminous fort” without moralizing. The silence after planting pamphlets invites reader reflection on unseen wildfire, satisfying ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: noticing cool bronze, numerals’ fade, rust scent. Diction remains within her lexicon; no elevated register drift. Rhythm accelerates through parataxis during planting, then cadence slows into final quiet, mirroring mission arc. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“she aligned the quill holder with the shadow” performs three jobs: action, cipher, image. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“cradle of sparks” recurs without muddle). Minor scaffold: “the fort remained dark” restates prior blackout; not clustered in closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-in-fort premise is refreshed by blackout-as-canvas and angle-cipher mechanic; sundial-as-code feels novel. Risk is taken with near-lyric repetition (“winking hush”) but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure. Specificity of quill/stone pairing keeps it from generic spy tale. Could swap names, yet blackout-sundial angle keeps local freshness.</comment>
