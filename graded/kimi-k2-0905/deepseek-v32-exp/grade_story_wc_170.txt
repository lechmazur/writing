<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but generic; “borrowed heartbeat” remains abstract, never embodied in a concrete micro-choice that costs her. She observes and hums, but the mirrors’ rippling feels like external magic rather than driven by visible, risky trade-offs. No contradictory impulse or flawed blind-spot surfaces, so the climax is graceful but unmotivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each refrain of the lullaby thickens the pattern and the prism-droplets refract new light, tightening the mood until the first bell. Closure is a Charged Poise—mirrors hold possibilities for one breath—so cost is conceptual, not felt. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no causal break, but escalation is purely tonal, lacking a narrowing option or tangible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The prism parapet is handled twice—first as palette, finally as the surface whose rainbows are relinquished when bells ring—so it constrains her canvas and charges the fade. Droplet-lenses, jasmine scent, and echoing stone are filtered through Lyra’s painterly bias, never tourist clutter. Spatial choreography stays clean; no world-rule gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the mirrors reveal possibility before sound breaks the spell—is signaled early, but pressure is purely atmospheric; no credible loss (energy, time, social risk) materializes. The single “tightening” is the bell toll, an external cue, not her agency foreclosing an option. Escalation is mood-deepening only; cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art’s power to make the world translucent versus reality’s inevitable reversion. No moral is stated; final image of fading mirages reweights earlier stanzas without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—did she change anything?—but relies too heavily on lyric echo rather than enacted consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lyra’s perceptions; diction (“mirage painter,” “prism parapet”) is textured and consistent. No dialogue to distort voice. Rhythm modulates with lullaby refrains, giving the prose a musical cadence that mirrors the concept. Filter-verb count is low; perceptual signature is vivid if slightly perfumed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and sustains the lyric mode, so density is earned. A few minor over-writes (“dusky harmony” twice) but none touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mirrors that answer lullabies is fresh; coupling them with a prism parapet after rain gives the piece a signature visual engine. The “borrowed heartbeat” concept, however, remains ornamental rather than transformative. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure itself—successfully executed—but the underlying conceit is still a painter who magics mirrors, a feathered version of “artist imbues life.”</comment>
