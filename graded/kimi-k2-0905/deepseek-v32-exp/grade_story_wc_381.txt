<comment>Elian’s solitude and “map silence” motive are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory choice; interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“a tranquil blaze of determination burned”) rather than embodied tension. No visible flaw or blind spot complicates his success, so the hush feels foreordained, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece layers refrains (“whispered secrets,” “smoothed hush”) until they crest in the final veil. Causality is thin—no beat shows the prophecy actually endangering anything—yet the cadence shift from murmur to silence lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the world’s balance is now dependent on Elian’s vigil, a price felt in the closing “for now.”</comment>

<comment>Brook, pouch, wing, and starlight are economically reused; the wing’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; sensory focus narrows to sound/void, suiting the ritual. Environment does not constrain tactics—the haven is a sanctuary, never a threat—so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared (“prevent chaotic unraveling”) but never tested on-page; no visible consequence or narrowing option occurs—the prophecy simply fades. Escalation is purely textural (repetition of “whispered secrets” softens), not causal. Cost is conceptual at closure, but lacks mid-story pressure, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-presence emerges through image rather than sermon, but the concept stays abstract because the prophecy’s content is withheld; ambiguity is deliberate yet untested. The crane wing’s final gleam offers a non-literal reprise, but without prior moral complexity the resonance is pleasing rather than profound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm; diction stays within plausible lexicon for a mystic. Repetition of “terrestrially cosmic” and “smoothed hush” becomes template cadence, dulling peak beats, but voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet synonym churn (“quiet brook’s flow,” “gentle flow,” “flow of energy”) and stacked modifiers (“terrestrially cosmic energies”) create scaffolding. Dense metaphor every sentence blurs physical logic—how does paper glow brighter?—but clarity survives. Closure line is clean, permitting mid-band score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“Mapping silence” as ritual mechanics is fresh; origami crane as celestial conduit gives a sharp inflection. The silent-prophecy premise risks abstraction, yet the lyric accumulation persuades. Risk is moderate, transformed through sensory specificity, not gimmick.</comment>
