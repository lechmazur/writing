<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s brittle-joker interiority stays specific; the moon-rock hand-off shows a micro-choice hierarchy (loneliness vs. connection) with felt cost. The “desperately jocular” mask never slides into therapy-speak; her refusal to stay and bask charges the ending. Only niggle: Leo’s interior shift is reported, not dramatized, so the co-catalyst feels slightly thinner. Still, Elara’s earned stasis is vivid and proportioned to 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each retelling tightens the reciprocity noose, pattern taught by 25 % and lands with conceptual repricing—“the station becomes a living heart.” Cost is legible in Elara’s vanishing and Leo’s warmed pocket. No orientation debt; ivy-station anchor appears by line 3. Closure beat reweights the premise without exposition. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station-plus-ivy is not backdrop but tactile constraint: mossy bench dictates seating ritual, crumbling arch echos “structural integrity” gag. Micro-setting object—the moon rock—literally charges the closing image. Sensory triage fits disaster-logistician POV: she clocks pigeons as logistics units. Environment forecloses the option to stay, forcing Elara’s exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cure loneliness via reciprocity”—tightens once: from passive rumor-hearing to active storytelling obligation. Visible price: Elara surrenders the talisman and her safe hideout. Agency is renunciation, not combat, but it forecloses return. Coincidence only seeds crowds, never solves; escalation remains coherent under accretive lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from gesture chain, not thesis: loneliness is only bearable when passed on like contraband. Final image of strangers laughing under vines reconfigures meaning without moral. Polite anarchy subverts “quiet suffering” norm—subtextual, not declared. Near 9.0 only because Leo’s stake lacks moral friction; Elara carries the thematic weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder; perceptual signature blends logistics jargon with gallows humor (“first-come, first-served” seating in ruins). Diction stays within disaster-worker lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates during hand-off, then quiets as she slips away—intentional cadence shift. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“I have a rock and a proposition”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density: “silence and vines conspired” does two jobs (setting + personification). No mixed metaphors; moon-rock as “stolen piece of silence” is precise. Sentence variation supports beat—long loopy lines for speech, staccato when rock changes hands. Final line earns its lyric lift without purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: logistician + moon rock + reciprocity = viral loneliness vaccine. Ivy-strangled station flipped from tomb to heart is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in “polite anarchy” tone pays off, charging closure. No trope echo; premise feels discovered, not engineered.</comment>
