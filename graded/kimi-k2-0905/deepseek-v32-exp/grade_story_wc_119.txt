<comment>Elara’s longing to escape the routine is palpable, but interiority drifts into mood-summary “she felt a deep urge” rather than body-level contradiction. The final shift from escape-to-purpose is declared, not dramatized: no on-page moment shows her renounce flight or pay cost for staying; we’re told “she no longer felt confined.” Micro-choices under pressure—slipping fortunes, watching Leo—exist, yet hinge on off-page daring rather than visible flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last image of two silhouettes weaving collaborative futures transposes isolation into shared stewardship of the beacon; cost is felt because both have burned their old lives (spy clearance gone, hermit solitude gone). Causal chain holds: microdot coordinates → Leo’s arrival → joint cache recovery → evidence burnishes names; each beat narrows options toward partnership. Lighthouse geography is anchored by ~120w and never contradicted; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog-sliced beam, salt-rusted lantern room, tide-slapped rocks—selective sensory triangulation keeps bodies oriented and choices limited: the rowboat is the only exit, the light the only way to signal allies. Microdot films function as mobile setting-objects; their physical handling (held to lamplight, scratched, buried) alters next moves. Weather and night-time curfew (“after last orders”) act as clocked environment that gates every cookie drop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will open secrets stay buried or ignite a new life?—is signaled in paragraph one: “accidentally prophetic…truths the islanders never acknowledged.” Escalation is steady: each fortune tightens scrutiny (microdot risk), Leo’s approach compresses space, cache discovery forecloses anonymity. Protagonist agency drives midpoint pivot—Elara decides to reveal network rather than flee—yet cost is more conceptual than visceral; no concrete forfeiture (job, safety) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Open secrets” reweights from shameful liability to communal catalyst; light-beacon motif reframes from isolation to invitation. No character moralizes; theme emerges via image: two keepers tending a shared beam. Final line (“waiting for the right person to decode”) converts cryptic craft into legacy, offering ambiguous hope rather than moral. Slight abstraction prevents 9+: theme is legible but not yet haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains salt-bitter, wick-flick rhythm; diction “salt-rusted, fog-long, cryptic” remains inside Elara’s autodidact sensorium. No dialogue till final beat, then only two precise lines that carry double duty—subtext exposed without exposition. Micro recurrences (“transpose,” “flow,” “open secrets”) create patterned cohesion rather than tic. Compression sometimes overprunes: Leo’s prior betrayal is named-not-shown, a missed cadence spike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long anaphoric swells build, then snap to monosyllabic row/drop/flash for momentum. Information density high—one line can layer sensory cue, plot step, motif echo. Occasional scaffold—“she orchestrated her liberation not through force, but by directing the flow”—restates prior sentence; one mixed metaphor “transpose her life into a new key” jars physical logic yet is saved by musical motif taught early. No loops near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Cold-War microdot noir with coastal magical-realist cookie prophecy feels inevitable here, not gimmick: both crafts hinge on tiny texts that refract hidden worlds. Transformation test passes—generic names would collapse because lighthouse + fortune cookie + espionage are mutually entailed. Fresh inflection: espionage redemption via baked poetry. The risk of twee is flirted but dodged by salt-stained specificity and earned partnership. One-half step from 9+ only because emotional cost stays conceptual.</comment>
