<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s “restlessness” is the only interior friction shown; all other emotion is abstract (“witness change without judgment”). No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, so the arc is static observation rather than tested resolve. The origami return lands as tranquil acceptance, but because no earlier tension is dramatized, the cost feels conceptual rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every paragraph thickens the same motif—decay as transformation—until the final image reweights it. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the keeper folds the swan, sealing the refuge, while the library’s “crumbling peace” is re-seen as renewal. Cost is felt in the silence that replaces action; no causality gaps appear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library, obsidian walls, and paper swan are tactile, odor-rich, handled onstage; they constrain movement (must fold to travel) and frame the final image. Selective detail—moss, dust, river hush—mirrors the thematic hush without cataloguing. Micro-setting (swan = portal) charges closure when it is refolded, sealing the altered stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Only one meaningful tightening: the restlessness that drives the first burrow. No later escalation; stakes stay philosophical—will the keeper keep watching?—and never narrow options or exact a visible price. Pressure plateaus after the portal opens; silence washes rather than tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: impermanence as quiet flowering, not loss. Final image of “new silence growing in the crumbs” reweights earlier decay without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—collapse equals renewal—yet the insight stays slightly abstract because no personal stake is jeopardized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, processional rhythm matches the meditative drive; diction stays within a timeless archivist register. Repetition of “grip reality loosely,” “regenerative silence,” and “crumbling peace” risks template cadence, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final line, so it reads as ritual refrain rather than artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences breathe with variable length; strong verbs (“clung,” “yawned,” “mend”) carry image. Occasional stacked abstractions (“weight of forgotten tales,” “symphony of quiet endings”) flirt with overwriting, but none cloud causality or dull the final image. No loops, no scaffold; diction stays clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Origami swan as portal, silence as regenerative force, and librarian-witness of entropy synthesize into a fresh constellation of familiar tropes. The inversion—decay as healing—feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk (no external jeopardy) is taken and landed; piece avoids generic post-apocalyptic library cliché by keeping stakes interior and hushed.</comment>
