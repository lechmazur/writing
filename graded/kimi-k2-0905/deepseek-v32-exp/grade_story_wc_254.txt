<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “tremor of certainty” is named, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he glides from observer to agent without friction. The smile at the end feels unearned because no visible flaw or cost has touched him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lake thaws, fear-based rule-set is re-weighted. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—images and hum deepen until meaning flips. Orientation clear by line 4; one seamless scene. Cost is present but diffused across landscape; lacks a single charged image that makes the price personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt glass, quartz hum, and cracked ice are vividly sensed and filter through the poet’s aesthetic bias. Micro-setting succeeds: the humming pillars double as key and tool, constraining his final step. Frozen lake’s thaw mirrors conceptual shift, charging closure. Selective, purposeful detail throughout; no filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve sacred boundaries—signaled early. Pressure escalates via texture: hum deepens, walls waver, lake cracks; poet’s agency is to keep speaking. No narrowing of options or credible loss; the boundary simply melts. Cost is atmospheric, not personal; escalation stays lyrical rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in impermanence—emerges from thawing ice and wavering walls, never moralized. Subtext lives in humming silence and mirrored cobalt, not statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs without sermon. Could risk more contradiction; as is, ambiguity is present but gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at poetic distance; diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “cobalt glow”) is consistent and texture-driven. Rhythm swells and subsides with scene tension. No dialogue, so voice remains un-contested. Compression and ellipsis are taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and syntax. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer is dense but patterned, not overwrought. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “aesthetically driven soul”—slightly academic for POV, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen-atrium lyricism feels fresh; concept of paraphrasing reality into dissolution is non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (forbidden zone, hum of power) are re-angled through poet’s aesthetic lens. Risk is present but safe; could push moral cost further. Memorable sensorium compensates for familiar scaffold.</comment>
