<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s trait-set (traveler-obituarist who “writes obituaries for the living”) is original, interiority is lyrically specific (“lonesome splendor of her task”), and her micro-choice to project Kael’s presence drives every beat. She shows contradictory impulses—closeness to Kael’s grief while guarding her own—without lapsing into diagnostic self-talk. Her final stance (“she would walk it with courage and grace”) is earned by the slow reveal of her own absences. Only minor hairline: the palace-thread prop sometimes feels more magical than she appears to believe.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the thread’s repeated projections thicken texture until the closing Charged Poise (“the thread now dull…its purpose fulfilled”). Orientation anchors land within 120 words (who=Elara, where=harbor garden, when=autumn/after-last-ship). Closure is a RR: Elara’s acceptance of “empty places” reweights the premise with felt cost. No causal turns are required under this lens; the deepening cadence is sufficient.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The autumn garden is not backdrop: skeletal trees cast “long shadows” that mirror Kael’s psyche, the damp bench forces her to “tighten her grip,” and the decay-scented wind charges the final image. The weft thread functions as micro-setting, handled in at least four beats; its fading redness physically signals closure. Spatial choreography stays clean (“she rose from the bench…steps quiet on the carpet of fallen leaves”). Sensory selection stays POV-filtered, never touristic.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to voice Kael’s living absence—signals early and tightens through each projection beat; the final projection leaves the thread “dull,” a visible cost that forecloses further immediate use. Escalation is textural: each new ghost-image intensifies emotional density rather than altering external options. No coincidence; the garden’s lonesomeness is coherent circumstance, not contrived threat. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: absences are “spaces where love once lived,” an insight earned through the thread’s glow-to-dull arc rather than asserted. Subtext operates in gesture—Elara uncurled fingers mirror Kael’s unspoken grief. Final image reweights without moralizing. Minor echo of “geography of healing” edges toward thematic label, but buried mid-story and distanced through POV filter.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices “skeletal trees,” “chill that spoke of endings,” and thread warmth—details a tourist would skip. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in reflection, then clipped openings (“She rose…”) for exit beat. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression (“she wrote in her thoughts”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is dense and musical—“autumn leaves fell like forgotten memories” risks stock but earns place via pattern return. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Mixed metaphor check passes: carpet/light/shadow imagery stays internally consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt…she understood…she realized”) in climax beat; does not obscure causality but prevents 9+.</question>

<question>8</question><question>8.6</question><comment>“Obituaries for the living” is fresh; palace-thread as projector avoids familiar ghost-tech tropes by anchoring in textile fragility. Conceptual synthesis—absence as geography—grows inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at opening. Autumn garden setting is familiar, but its function as memory-projection screen is specific. Risk stays lyrical rather than spectacle, coherent to lens.</question>
