<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but stays abstract—“incisively kind” is repeated instead of enacted; the only embodied moment is the reach for the ampoule. The decision to pour the memory-essence is credible, yet the cost (loss of solitude, burden of guardianship) is declared, not dramatized in body or voice. Still, the statue’s shift from stasis to curator is legible and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty ampoule among sea-flower roots reweights guardianship from rigidity to flexible stewardship; cost is the irrevocable dispersal of concentrated memory. Causal chain holds—ampoule → seam → inscription → shared awakening—though the “structural weakness” method is named only at the pour beat. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Submerged garden is tactile—drifting seaweed, bioluminescent coral, kelp “breathing”—and the fissured monument literally channels the climax. Sensory hierarchy fits a motionless observer: slow sway, shimmer, stone grain. Micro-setting (ampoule seam) directly enables the final act; environment constrains the pour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solitary certainty vs. communal guardianship. Pressure escalates through each cascade—each inscription narrows the option of remaining alone. The pour is the single decisive trade-off; price is the permanent dispersal of private memory into shared substrate. No external antagonist needed; internal tension suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—nuance over absolutism—emerges from the foxglove duality and the statue’s voluntary surrender of fixed identity. Final image of empty ampoule among roots reweights “poison or remedy” into “wisdom through vulnerability.” No moralizing statement; meaning stays in the object. Subtext is quiet but coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays anchored to the statue’s telepathic sensorium; diction is lapidary, slow, stone-appropriate—“thread its awareness,” “liquid light spilled.” No head-hopping; voice modulates from static marble to tentative outreach without breaking register. Repetition of “incisively kind” is the only tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: sentences vary in length, no filter-verb stacks, metaphors stay physical (“waves against the shore”). Occasional template cadence—“cascading revelations” x3—slips toward mantra. No mixed metaphors or loops in the closure beat; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Living statue + telepathy + underwater memory-garden is fresh, yet the “cascading revelations” device risks video-game lore dump; the piece redeems it by tying each reveal to the single physical act of pouring. Foxglove-as-memory-ink is an elegant repurposing. Risky compression succeeds; no derivative echo.</comment>
