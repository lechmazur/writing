<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “hands shaking from cold and certainty” while she re-tunes the dish shows embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to attenuate instead of amplify is a visible shift in values that forecloses the loud-signal path. Motivation stays legible but never over-articulated; the single flaw is the late, slightly abstract tag “fantasy practicality” that edges toward thesis-speak instead of felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The causal spine is clean: because the charts fail, therefore she discards the loud-signal assumption, which triggers the attenuation move that lands the tone. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moon recedes but the silence-tuning insight is now an irreversible perceptual asset; cost is the forfeiture of ever again hearing the cosmos as noise. Lens holds accumulative → causal shift without wobble; only a trace scaffold repetition (“serenely electric” ×3) keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The tower grate under her boots, the dish’s metallic hum, and the shard’s sound-absorbing dark are tactile micro-settings that constrain every motion she can make. Weather (lunar perigee wind) is not backdrop but literal sway-force that times the tuning beat. Spatial choreography stays pinned—no impossible reaches or floating props—so the setting charges the final image of the gorge as cradle, not abyss. Meets 9+ gate: the shard-as-tool literally focuses the closing insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hear the hidden beginning inside collapse—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when she realizes the signal is silence itself. One meaningful reversal: amplification path is foreclosed, attenuation becomes the only live option, and the price is the permanent loss of loud-signal certainty. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than multi-turn, perfectly legitimate at this length. Cost is legible on-page: “the hollywood star fragment cool again” marks the irreversible transfer of warmth into insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of discarded assumptions rather than any stated thesis; the final image of the gorge-as-cradle reweights the earlier relic-of-failure vista. The shard-of-hush motif accrues meaning through use, not label, culminating in the insight that silence is plenum. Only a faint echo of the prompt’s own “fantasy practicality” phrase keeps the resonance from feeling entirely authorless.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized; perceptual signature is consistent—“creaking structures” felt in her knees, moon gravity tasted in jaw. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“she watched as the metal hummed”) then widens to cosmic scale without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative clauses build density, then short fragments (“A single note”) deliver the pay-off. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful; the only nit is triple-use of “serenely electric” which edges toward template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional work without scaffolding. Metaphors are internally consistent—silence as canvas, gorge as cradle—never mixed. No paraphrase loops; the repeated “serenely electric” is the single visible pattern, and it is paid off in closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the tuning action; final sentence lands on monosyllabic cadence that mirrors the single clear tone she hears.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic antenna field, moonlit epiphany—are retooled through the concrete mechanic of attenuation-as-discovery. The shard-of-hush is not a generic magic rock but an active void whose properties are tested on-page. Risk is taken in making silence the actual signal, yet the logic is pre-seeded and pays off cleanly. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed from prior famous scenes.</comment>
