<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s vocational motive—star-navigation as existential bridge—stays coherent; the anchor-link micro-choices (pocket-fiddle, lecture prop) externalize her internal contradiction (depth vs sky). Student Kael’s shift from blank stare to questions dramatizes her influence, but his interior remains a cipher; relationship crucible therefore only half-fired. Closure beat earns credible renunciation: she accepts ocean as launchpad, chain still in hand—cost felt. No competence inflation; humility intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: alien-contact rupture → curriculum redesign → Kael’s catalyzed curiosity → Elara’s crystallized stance. Closure is Charged Poise: hologram fades, she grips chain, ocean reconfigured as runway—conceptual cost legible ("prison" becomes "launchpad"). No orientation debt; who/where established by sentence 3. One soft risk: off-page alien details never tighten pressure here, but since pedagogy is the real antagonist, the ellipsis is acceptable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Compressed sensory triad—low resonance hum, translucent coral corridors, holographic star bloom—anchors benthic life without itinerary clutter. Anchor-link micro-setting recurs, finally charges closure image. Spatial choreography clean: Elara’s pocket draw, laser pointer arc, student semi-circle tracked. Weather not needed; pressure is intellectual. Nano-ceramic phrase is lone tech splinter, quickly subsumed by coral tactility—does not obstruct.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving celestial navigation to reclaim human horizon—signals early. Escalation occurs through pedagogical tension: Kael’s apathy threatens mission, his questions validate it; option space narrows from doubt to conviction. Cost is mostly conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than tangible loss; would benefit from one physical forfeiture (e.g., dimming dome power budget) to juice pressure. Still, agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge of stars as psychic anchor after cosmic vertigo—emerges through anchor-link counterpoint rather than sermon. Subtext resides in Kael’s silence-to-speech arc and Elara’s tactile fondling of rusted metal: history fondles back. Final image reweights ocean from exile to runway without moralizing. Minor drift: "true expansion of human thought" edges toward thesis-statement but is embedded early enough to feel like character rationale, not author tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: coral light "hums," stars "bloom," chain "wears smooth." Syntax lengthens during holographic awe, contracts when she pockets the link—rhythmic calibration under emotional load. No dialogue contamination; speech minimal and goal-driven. Free indirect thought clean: "she believed..." reads as paraphrase, not filter surplus. Lexicon plausible for ocean-floor educator—no ivory-tower diction slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do twin duty (exposition + atmosphere). No scaffold loops; "anchor" repeats only when thematic weight accrues. Mixed-metaphor risk—"tapestry of stars" beside "rust flakes in coral veins"—but coral reappears later, knitting pattern. Minor over-modification: "low, resonant energy" could lose one adjective. Final sentence cadence lands with satisfying thud, no drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of benthic cyber-coral with ancient celestial navigation feels fresh; xenocartography lecture avoids textbook info-dump by tying to tactile relic. Risk: "post-contact pedagogy" could slide to writing-workshop prompt, but anchor-link specificity grounds it. Edge-geometry method is under-demonstrated—more diagrammatic than revolutionary. Still, synthesis of underwater life + star longing achieves non-obvious emotional algebra.</comment>
