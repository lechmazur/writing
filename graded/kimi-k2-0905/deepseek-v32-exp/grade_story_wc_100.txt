<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elijah’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted but never dramatized—he never fights, doubts, or pays for it; the undertaker vocation supplies mood yet zero occupational leverage under water. The interiority drifts into abstract thematic summary (“rest had found its permanent address”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is gentle but cost-free: weariness simply lifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The causal spine is thin: package → curiosity → dive → fix lens → souls freed. Each step is stated, not tested; the “impossible space” moonlight shaft appears only at the instant it solves the problem, so the decisive change feels engineered rather than earned. Orientation is clear early, lens is Accumulative/Textural, closure lands as Charged Poise, but the missing cost keeps it short of 7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Submerged city and library are sketched with sharp, selective sensory cues—“marble columns standing defiantly against the currents,” “pages floating like ghosts”—that stay inside Elijah’s solemn gaze. The moonlit air-pocket is physically dubious but accepted as taught magical rule. Spatial choreography stays clean; environment supplies the final stage but does not constrain tactics earlier, capping it at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—restore lost souls—but never personalized or endangered; Elijah’s breath supply, submersible limits, or even fear are absent, so pressure stays abstract. The one escalation is discovering the moonbeam chamber, yet it presents no trade-off or visible price. Agency is present (he chooses to stay and fix) but consequence is weightless, keeping escalation functional yet thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “using the broken to make whole” emerges organically through the lens repair and soul release, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext is light—no ironic gap or dramatic irony—relying on image resonance alone. Final line offers quiet reconfiguration rather than proclamation, satisfying the emergent criterion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elijah; perceptual signature leans funeral-quiet, with restrained metaphor and liturgical cadence. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on diction—“sodden and salt-stained,” “rest a permanent address”—which is consistent though occasionally elevated for a working undertaker. Syntax varies, but several template stems (“he… then he…”) dull the rhythm slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, evocative, and mostly propulsive; sentences carry double duty. Occasional overwriting—“quietude perpetually fleeing ahead of him,” “thick, dark quilt”—and a few paraphrase loops (“the weight of the lens… puzzling companion… whispered of the sea”) nudge it off 8+ territory. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing undertaker with underwater library-lens repair is an unlikely, memorable synthesis; the premise feels fresh yet internally coherent. Tropes (lost underwater city, broken beacon) are repurposed through funeral imagery and spectral books. Risk is moderate—quiet magical realism—but execution stays legible. Specificity of the lens-as-signal rather than light keeps it from template.</comment>
