<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Interiority is textured and painter-specific (“pigment and canvas,” “kaleidoscope of half-remembered smiles”). Contradictory impulses—fear of the abyss vs. need to descend—coexist in real time. The final micro-choice, sketching his own map on a forgotten book, is earned by the causal chain of tarot and memory threads. Cost is visible: he forfeits the old identity as “portrayer of surfaces.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam becomes a guide “through” darkness, reweighting the premise. Causal lens holds—each memory thread tightens options until descent is the only剩余 path. Cost is legible in the phrase “blank pages of a forgotten book,” a literal forfeiture of future commissions. Pattern taught early (torn Magician, split World) pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The library-lighthouse is not backdrop; its groaning shelves and salt-stung dust actively narrow Elian’s focus to the oak table. The micro-setting of the splintered tarot box constrains his hands and thought sequence. Final image of the internalized beam is charged by the prior “luminescent ache” motif. Spatial choreography is flawless—walls, table, box, charcoal form a tightening spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“map the darkness within”—is signaled by the third paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each untangled memory raises the psychic cost of remaining a surface painter. The decisive tightening is the moment he sees he “had not failed but succeeded” in exposing loneliness; this forecloses retreat. Price is visible: he accepts lifelong marginalization as a soul-cartographer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</theme>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of portraiture: truth is not captured but revealed by damaging the viewer. Subtext lives in gesture—gathering the cards is an act of accepting brokenness, not prophecy. Final image reframes the lighthouse from warning tower to companion in darkness. No moralizing; the resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly—syntax layers like glazes: “salt of the sea,” “luminescent ache.” Perceptual signature is color-centric, light-obsessed, consistent with occupation. No head-hopping; compression (“walls pressed inward”) is taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, staccato questions under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: “the air hung thick with the dust of neglected knowledge and the salt of the sea” does three jobs in twelve words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors are coherent (kaleidoscope, cartographer) and tied to Elian’s craft. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-story (−0.2) but none in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: turns the trope of the tormented artist into a cartographer of interior coastlines. Lighthouse-library is a novel crucible; tarot cards re-cast as broken mirrors rather than fortune engines. The “luminescent ache” coinage is memorable and precise. Risk—lyric, almost mystical descent—pays off because closure remains legible.</comment>
