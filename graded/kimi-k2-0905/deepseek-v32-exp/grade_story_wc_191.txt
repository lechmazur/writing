<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “wisely adventurous” trait is announced, not embodied; her only risky beat (entering the dark passage) is glossed in a single clause. Interiority is stock (“heart heavy,” “heart pounding”) and never contradicts itself. The ruby flake acts as external GPS, so discovery feels handed to her; no micro-choice shows balanced competence and fear. Earned stasis is missing because the coronation costs nothing—no renunciation, no visible price. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—flake→murals→door→stair→throne—but escalation is linear, not tightening; each mural simply gives the next key. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she inherits a ruined world she can never unknow (holograms of “history flowing into her”). Orientation is firm by line 3; no lens ambiguity. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall and silver orchard are sharply sensed and refracted through goal-directed attention (“air hummed with latent energy”). The domed star-throne ceiling recurs as final image, reconfiguring the opening nostalgia into live responsibility. Setting constrains her path—she must physically peel paint and climb the spiral—earning micro-setting credit. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake—claim throne before sunrise—is clear, but sunrise is a background timer that never forces tactical change; she reaches the top with casual ease. No credible loss or trade-off; murals cooperate without resistance. Pressure stays flat because the flake eliminates uncertainty. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “restoring balance by understanding the past” emerges from mural images rather than authorial lecture. The final holographic download reweights the orchard’s nostalgic beauty into lived burden, achieving quiet resonance. No moralizing line violates the show-don’t-tell rule. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s noticing (“decaying archives,” “iridescent hues”). Rhythm is competent but syntactically generic; no distinctive idiom marks her scholar background. No dialogue to judge. </comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean but leans on abstract intensifiers (“magnificent,” “mesmerizing”) and stacked adjectives. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job. </comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Fallen-tech city + paint-peel archaeology is fresh synthesis; throne-claiming via flake-shaped socket avoids generic key. Risk is present but modest—no structural experimentation. Derivative “last lore-keeper” frame is offset by specific sensory world. </comment>
