<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. clandestine yearning—animates every beat; the moment she whispers decoded lyrics to dust and watches it crown, her renunciation of safety is earned. No secondary character applies pressure, yet her micro-choices under surveillance risk (notation tampering) scale credibly. Flaw: “thistled calm” leans toward diagnostic label, not embodied cost; still, the final image of dust glowing with stolen stories shows visible, priced endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she copies scores → discovers coded lyrics → implants micro-ciphers → dust glows. Closure is Charged Poise: the alcove breathes legends while outside famine persists—options reweighted, cost felt. One transition (nightly returns) is legible; anchor (who/where/when) fixed by word 80. Persistent constraint—secrecy—shapes every tactic; no explain-all ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember alcove + shortwave dial function as micro-setting: warmth vs. detection risk constrain her nightly returns; dust-crown reprises at closure, recharging stakes. Sensory hierarchy obeyed—copyist ear for notation filters what she notices. Mist and coals evolve with scene heat; spatial track clean. World rule (lyrics as cipher) kept consistent via on-page decoding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep broadcast alive while seeding stories—tightens when she embeds code in orchestral scores: one visible trade-off (discovery by authorities). Escalation causal: each new cipher song raises notation tampering risk; no coincidence resolves. Cost legible: “thistled calm” shows constant vigilance. Could use one tangible loss (e.g., missed cue in orchestra) to hit 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—art as subversive memory—emerges through dust accepting stories, not thesis. Pirate’s final line scatters “seeds on the wind,” reweighting premise without moral. Motif of hidden light (radio, dust) recurs and charges ending image. Resists tidy allegory; ambiguity lingers: will seeds survive famine?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, pattern-taught compression (“ember alcove, thistled calm”) stays legible; perceptual signature—copyist’s auditory precision—shapes metaphors. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentence when decoding, short clauses under risk. No dialogue to distort. Free indirect clean; diction within plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform copyist’s meticulous tempo. High density: “cloak of song lyrics” does triple work (metaphor, plot device, theme). No loops or scaffold; metaphor strings purposeful. One mixed image—“thistled calm” (thistles prickle, calm soothes)—but does not obscure closure. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: orchestra copyist + pirate radio + dust as mnemonic archive feels inevitable in hindsight. Dust-as-medium transforms familiar post-apocalypse trope into tactile rebellion. Risk—lyric accumulation, quiet ending—paid off by charged poise. No template echo; specific occupational detail (micro-notation tampering) grounds concept.</comment>
