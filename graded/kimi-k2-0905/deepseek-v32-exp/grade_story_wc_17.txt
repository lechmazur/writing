<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured (“the weight of silent histories in every stone”), but her agency is mostly receptive—she kneels, reads, senses—rather than decisive. The “burden of legacy” is absorbed more than contested; no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path until the final sentence, and even that isassertive, not dramatized. Sensory embodiment is strong, yet emotional contradiction is absent; she never hesitates or misreads an echo, so pressure never tests perceptual limits. The closure renunciation carries conceptual cost, but the causal chain is retrospective summary, not enacted stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diaries/negative reweight her vocation from “mapping echoes” to “carrying burdens,” with the satchel’s weight standing in for felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each artifact layers guilt until the corridor’s hum reframes her purpose. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. However, escalation is ambient, not driven by a tightening choice; the preserved memory is encountered, not pursued through narrowing options, so pressure plateaus rather than peaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivy, ash, cold stone, and film emulsion are viscerally anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias—“echoes” as tactile, olfactory, visual data. The fireplace-as-archive constrains discovery mechanics and provides the negative that recharges closure. Spatial choreography is clean: boot-scuff, kneel, extract, hold to light. Environment mirrors internal shift from “damp decay” to “hopeful hum,” but the ivy itself never actively impedes or enables; it’s mood rather than material constraint, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legacy’s guilt—surfaces at midpoint via diary excerpts; pressure intensifies texturally as each artifact thickens moral weight. No active opposition or lost option, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (she will “carry” truth) rather than tangible loss on page. Sufficient for short-form accumulative design, but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposed images: sunlight family negative vs. charred confession—innocence corrupted by progress. No explicit moralizing; final “compass guiding her” is metaphoric reconfiguration. Subtext operates in object silence—the half-burned page speaks louder than overt guilt. Ambiguity lingers: redemption is a “hum,” not a promise, avoiding tidy closure. Minor deduction for “what walls dream” prompt-echo, but it is integrated early and re-priced at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Third-person hovering close to Elara’s sensorium: syntax lengthens with lyric cadence, compresses during tactile beats (“She knelt, carefully extracting”). Perceptual signature is consistent—echo as touch, ivy as breath. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a solitary cartographer-poet. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and earned. Final image crystallizes without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Rhythm modulates from languid clause-stacking to short surgical actions; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are disciplined—“walls dream” is taught early and reprised. One scaffold: “She understood that the echoes were not just sounds, but embodied regrets…” could be cut without loss. No figurative muddle in peak beat. High density overall, but the single explanatory sentence prevents 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>“Corridor echo cartographer” is fresh world-building that fuses post-climate ruin with metaphysical survey. Combining weather-control guilt + half-burned film negative reframes eco-catastrophe through intimate archive—non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken and paid off: no antagonist, no dialogue, yet stakes feel large because legacy is internalized. Conceptual integrity holds; premise is never soft-pedalled.</comment>
