<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is grounded in tactile detail (fingers on brass, dust veils), and her broken-hearted archivist identity is shown through method—sorting, cross-referencing, displaying—not label. The final choice to exhibit the button is earned, but the micro-turns inside the file room are low-stakes; we see tenderness, not contradictory impulse under fire. Emotional cost is present yet diffuse, capping the arc below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the button’s re-display reweights the archive from “neglect” to “hope,” with visible cost in Elara’s spent evening and opened wound. Causality is sound—dust pattern reading → letters found → Miller tracked → Jonah’s legacy revealed—though the tightening happens off-stage (Jonah’s adulthood, Miller’s survival). The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The foster-care file room functions as micro-setting: dust thickness becomes the tool that guides choices. Selective sensory triage—brittle paper, brass chill, gray film—mirrors Elara’s tender precision. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. The button as recurring object charges the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate, yet environment does not actively constrain a high-stakes decision, keeping score just sub-exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can a small kindness endure?”—is signaled early and deepens as Elara unearths the Miller-Jonah thread. Pressure is textural: each discovered letter layer adds density rather than narrower options. The final reconfiguration lands via display choice, but no live option is foreclosed; the cost is retrospective. Sufficient for high-band entry, but lacks a tightening beat that forces trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: archival dust = palimpsest of overlooked kindness. The button’s migration from private keepsake to public exhibit reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—letters ceased, yet kindness propagated. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: new dust will accumulate, now “stories of hope,” fulfilling the 9-band ask for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “dust as palimpsest,” “tactfully hopeful demeanor.” Syntax is steady, slightly formal, matching archivist precision. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm could vary more under emotion, but compression suits accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence layers archival process with emotional stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “dust” recurs with purpose. Metaphors (dust = palimpsest) stay coherent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif. Minor scaffold: repeated “small kindness” phrasing near end (−0.2). Closure image untouched; keeps high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Freshens the “orphan-file mystery” trope by making the investigator a failed-adoptive archivist healing herself through dust forensics. Dust-as-texture and button-as-witness feel specific, not borrowed. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate—quiet archival sleuthing—but coherence is high. Could push higher with sharper irreversible consequence.</comment>
