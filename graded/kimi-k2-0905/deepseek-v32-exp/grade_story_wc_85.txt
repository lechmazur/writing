<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—the watch hand “pulse[s] with silent accusation,” guilt “twist[s] her insides”—but the psychological arc leans on retrospective summary rather than in-scene contradiction. The final renunciation is earned, yet the brother’s death is reported not dramatized, softening the cost. Still, Elara’s flaw drives every beat and the voice stays specific to her profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: terrace → shore → carving → withheld memory → renunciation. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis—she forecloses the lie-trade with the watch hand’s fate—while the carving reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. The brother’s off-stage death is the single un-tested pivot, but it is framed as already-paid cost, not fresh coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, driftwood, and watch hand form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move: terrace launches her, shore filters noise to “sieved hush,” carving forces confrontation. Sensory selection is POV-driven—cool metal, damp sand, etched dates—never tourist-catalog. Final image charges the terrace as mirror rather than prison, reconfiguring the color as reflective, not imprisoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she face the withheld truth?—tightens once: the carving she herself etched confronts her, narrowing options to endure or crack. No reversal, but the deepening is visceral and irreversible. Cost is conceptual (lifelong guilt made legible) and future-facing (she abandons her trade). Agency is interior yet decisive; coincidence never rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: false genealogies vs. irretrievable real death. No moralizing—meaning accrues through the watch hand’s re-weighting and the terrace’s color shift. Ambiguity is preserved: she gains no redemption, only irreversible knowledge. Final image of sea burial offers resonant, non-literal answer to “what does a truth weigh?”—a silence that can only be carried.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s professional precision. Rhythm mirrors tide-like accumulation without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice carries subtextual guilt without diagnostic labels. POV modesty holds—no knowledge leaps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do triple duty: “the cacophony of the city died, leaving only the whisper of wind and water” advances setting, stakes, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted acceptance. Opening and closing lines frame and recharge the color motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Black-market genealogist who erases living kin is fresh; driftwood as self-incriminating archive re-frames found-object art. Conceptual risk—quiet interior climax—pays off by making silence audible. Could tip into trope of guilt-ridden artist, but specificity of trade and object saves it. Risk enhances rather than obscures coherence.</comment>
