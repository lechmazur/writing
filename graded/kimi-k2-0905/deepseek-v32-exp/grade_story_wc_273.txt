<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—serene anger—anchors every beat; the micro-choice to step into vanishing ink is embodied, irreversible, and visibly costly. His “consciously wild” trait drives the method, not a label. No second character, so status/relationship bullets N/A. The earned stasis (return alone, knowledge won but futile) is fully motivated by prior causality. Minor slip: “serene anger” verges on diagnostic speak in one clause, but the embodied chill of the final smile keeps it above the −0.6 line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time-dilation is subjective, a gift of crisis, and this reweights every prior beat with a felt cost—Kael’s solitude is now permanent. Lens is Causal: because he accepts the mental mechanism, therefore he abandons further pursuit. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no debt. The hummingbird data and ink mechanics pay off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the ink always vanishes, mirroring the transient answer he is left with. Cost is legible in the thin smile and wind of “dust and change.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved caves, bleached-bone skin, and drone iridescence are filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze; each detail is tactile and choice-relevant. The vanished ink on stone becomes the micro-setting that literally gates entry; environment constrains the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible drone positions. At 8.7 because no external environment alters tactics after the shift; the landslide is observed, not interacted with.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock time-dilation—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the ink gateway begins to evaporate. Agency: Kael’s decision to step into the pattern is irreversible and costs him permanent exile from objective answers. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the ink’s vanishing imposes a hard clock that forces the step. Cost is visible—he returns alone, theory in hand, but the mystery can never be “held” again.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring vanish-act (ink, time, self) and ends with the conceptual repricing: knowledge itself disappears the moment it is grasped. No moralizing; the final line lets wind and dust carry the implication. Subtextual turn: the tracker who tames wildness must accept that the wildest force is perception itself. Ambiguity lingers—was the dilation real or just consciousness?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kael’s perceptual bandwidth; diction—“color of a winter sky,” “captured jewel”—is his tracker-poet idiom. Rhythm tightens under pressure: clipped clauses as ink fades, then elongates in slowed-time observation. No head-hopping or register drift. The “serene anger” refrain risks label-speak but is earned by repeated embodied coldness; voice remains singular and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“frozen waves” of stone, “captured jewel” drone—never crowding crisis beats. Information density is high: ink properties, drone task, time-theory all embedded in action. Opening and final lines are propulsive and echo each other without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: albino tracker + vanishing-ink time-gate + subjective-dilation theory is not a trope stack seen elsewhere. Transformation test fails if Kael is renamed, because the albino interface with light and ink is biologically specific. Risky structural vanish-reappear is taught early and paid off. The conceptual twist—that crisis clarity is the evolved weapon—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
