<comment>Elian’s shift from angry exile to annotator who sees perception as the prison is dramatized through micro-choices—hand trembling on shard, confident final strokes—each motivated by the archivist’s combative prompts. The archivist’s backward-walking tic externalizes her own cost of mentorship, creating a lived contradiction that tightens the crucible. Interiority stays concrete: “anger is a shield” is immediately tested by the glass cool against skin. Only the “resilience is the sword” line drifts toward aphorism, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Situational lens: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization. The swing’s creak → hush → silence acts as a live metronome that narrows options until Elian’s annotation becomes the single available act of agency. Closure is a Charged Poise: the archivist walks forward for the first time, paying the visible cost of her own nerves now transferred to the annotated shard in Elian’s hand. No causality breaks; every beat either lifts knowledge or forecloses retreat.</comment>

<comment>The forgotten library is rendered through tactile micro-setting: dust under shuffle-steps, cool glass against skin, tea-stain angles measured by finger. Shard-mirrors function as both archive and mirror—literal tools that constrain how memory can be handled. The swing’s creak off-page is the only auditory anchor, tightening the hush until its final silence lets the visual deepen. This environmental pressure directly shapes the mentor-pupil stakes and charges the closing image of the archivist finally walking forward.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reversible exile—tightens through perceptual reframing, not external antagonist. Each annotation beat escalates by shrinking Elian’s options: wall → gate → mirror → own reflection. The cost is conceptual but legible: once he marks the shard, return is possible only by accepting the annotated version of self. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping this just shy of 9-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the geometry of leaves and glass: exile is a map, not a verdict. Subtext lives in gesture—walking backwards is retreat-as-advance—and in the final forward step that reconfigures the premise without naming it. No moralizing line; the swing’s dying creak supplies the conceptual repricing. Resonance lingers because the reader must complete the map on the shard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited situates cleanly inside the archivist’s nervous body, then briefly widens to Elian’s tremor without head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: she notices shadow angles by finger-circles, he notices cool glass first. Syntax grows clipped under swing-creak tension, then lengthens when annotation flows. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt a surge of pride”) is forgivable at closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously: “shard-mirror archivist moved…” Each sentence advances either tactile setting or emotional pressure. Metaphors stay physical—shadow as memory slice, leaves as gate—never mixed. Only minor thud in “combat tenderness” coinage, not enough to dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshens mentor-mentee trope by making pedagogy a literal mirror-practice; shard-as-textbook feels inevitable in hindsight. Backward-walk quirk is not gimmick but stance crystallization device. Tea-leaf geometry rescues fortune-telling from cliché by tying exile reversal to measurable angle rather than prophecy. Risk stays tied to emotional stakes rather than world-rules, keeping originality grounded.</comment>
