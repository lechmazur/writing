<comment>Elias’s reticence is shown through quiet action, not told, and his “warmly observant” eyes anchor interiority. Yet his final resolve feels slightly abstract—no concrete flaw or contradiction is tested under pressure, so the cost reads as thematic rather than personal. The turn from passive curiosity to active guardianship is legible but not viscerally earned. Still, the characterization stays consistent, voice-specific, and avoids label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: flicker → dark discovery → stone code → letters → resolve. Orientation is clean by word 80; no prop teleporting. Closure lands as Charged Poise—lamp relit, sea glass warmed, stance crystallized—yet the cost (what he forfeits or risks) is only implied, not felt on the page. The persistent constraint (future guardianship) is announced, not dramatized, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The lantern room, cliff, and sea glass are filtered through Elias’s mariner gaze; sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight—oil crates, wick scent, stone stack under bare fingers. Spatial choreography is flawless; stones are re-stacked, compartment clicked, glass pocketed—each object state tracked. Environment directly shapes tactics: darkness forces tactile code-reading, stone order unlocks wall. The lighthouse as micro-setting constrains the final image—beam cutting dawn—so 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“protect the light”—is signaled by the etched glass and tightens when the lamp dies. Agency is present: Elias re-orders stones, opens cache, chooses guardianship. Cost is conceptual (lifelong secrecy) rather than tangible; no credible loss (time, tool, social credit) is dramatized. Escalation is singular but coherent under Causal lens; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship emerges through the relay of objects—glass, stones, letters—never moralized. Final image reweights “bottling safety” as communal, not personal, without stating it. Subtext resides in Elias’s quiet stacking motion: duty encoded in muscle. Ambiguity lingers—who wrote?—inviting reflection rather than closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Elias’s perceptual filters—gulls overhead, oil scent, stone edges. No head-hopping; diction remains salt-crusted and monosyllabic under stress. Rhythm mirrors tide—long sentence, short beat, flicker, dark—without algorithmic pattern. Filter verbs are sparse and motive-driven (“his fingers closed”). Voice is distinctive yet unobtrusive, earning high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors are spare—“luminescent ache”—and never layered. Opening and closing lines frame beam/ache callbacks, creating purposeful echo. A single near-cliché (“heart pounding”) is forgiven under pressure. Overall, line-level craft supports rather than stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The stone-code + anonymous-letter chain freshens the familiar “lonely keeper” trope; sailor emergency cipher is specific and grounded. Sea glass as message medium feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but specificity of maritime minutiae lifts it above generic ghost-lighthouse tale. Transformation test passes: swap ciphers and glass, story collapses.</comment>
