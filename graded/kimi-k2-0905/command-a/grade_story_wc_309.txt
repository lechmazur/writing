<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s “underachieving mage” label is stated, not dramatized—he succeeds on the first real test, so the flaw never complicates choice. Interiority drifts into prompt-speak (“solace in the forgotten art…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The closing epiphany is gentle but feels pre-ordained; no visible cost forecloses a path, so the arc lands as affirmation, not Earned Stasis. Still, his tactile handling of the harness and the mist-walk micro-choice show brief flashes of idiosyncratic agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights “simple” effort as sacred, with cost felt in the brightened luminance on exit. Causal chain holds—harness → mist-walk → survival → insight—though the trap’s geometry is vague and the keystone’s rules appear only when needed. Orientation is secure by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The primary weakness: stakes never tighten beyond a generic “prove himself,” so the final reconfiguration is softly charged rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire, breath-crystals, and shifting luminous walls are vividly selective; the keystone’s impossible geometry is sketched through Eli’s fingertips, not exposition. Spatial choreography is clean—footsteps, harness anchor, mist step—each detail constrains the next move. The micro-setting (harness, keystone, mist) literally enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the “automation age” above the clouds is asserted, never shown, keeping the world-rule surface thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove manual magic matters”—is declared early but abstract; pressure is situational (colliding walls) rather than causal or accruing. One meaningful tightening: walls close, harness/mist gambit becomes the only path, paid for by transient terror. Cost is visible (panic, disorientation) yet not persistent; no future constraint or social price lingers. Escalation is single-step, adequate for 700-word scope but not reinvested at exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—sacred resides in imperfect human effort—emerges through the keystone’s re-pricing, avoiding final moralizing. Subtext is thin: no silence, gesture, or ironic gap deepens the idea. The luminous dimness motif returns charged in the last line, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. Complexity is modest; the automated world is asserted antagonist rather than dramatized counter-argument, so theme feels slightly lopsided.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Eli’s perceptual filter: “breath crystallized,” “surface shifting between patterns that defied logic.” Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror panic. No dialogue, so idiom consistency is moot. Occasional lofted diction (“accommodate impossibilities”) drifts toward prompt cadence but remains legible; overall rhythm is controlled, with variance in paragraph length that supports breathless ascent versus quiet exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances image, motion, or interior tilt. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors are sparse and coherent. Minor scaffold: “lingering luminance” is repeated four times without new inflection, blunting sonic freshness. Filter verbs minimal; opening sentence could drop “got automated” for immediacy, but line-level errors never obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept—“manual magic vs automated loom spells”—is fresh, yet interior beats (underdog enters maze, proves worth, exits enlightened) follow a familiar fantasy arc. The keystone’s impossible geometry and mist-walking mechanics add discrete speculative sparks, but neither is explored beyond plot utility. Final re-pricing feels satisfying but not surprising; hindsight does not reveal hidden pattern. Risk is moderate; execution competent, memorable mainly for luminous ice imagery rather than conceptual flip.</comment>
