<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers brushing the loaf, the tang of sourdough—but “find the sacred in the ordinary” is stated more than dramatized. The plaque line is an external echo of her motive rather than a pressure-tested choice. Still, her gardening micro-choices (digging, planting lavender) embody the trait and earn the quiet ending. Cost is present—exhaustion, fragile peace—but the absolution stays abstract, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (damp earth, bread scent, plaque) deepens the stake of “tenuous absolution.” The bread’s reappearance acts as a pattern break that reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is clear by line 4; the single shard satisfies scope. Closure lands as Charged Poise: lantern-lit bread + lavender crystallize options and cost without needing a physical reversal. No因果 breaks; persistent constraint (ivy, ruins) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Palace courtyard breathes through touch and smell—damp earth, crumbling statues—each detail filtered by Elara’s gardener eye. Micro-setting (plaque, tea-house table, ivy patch) constrains every dig and plant; the stone’s inscription directly guides her final lavender placement. Spatial choreography is clean: bread → table → crumbs brushed off → trowel work → lantern light. Weather and season (“sun dipped,” “birds flown south”) affect mood and tempo. Final image (golden glow on bread) recharges earlier sensory motifs, qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claiming fragile grace from decay—signals early and tightens as each gardening act uncovers more ruin. Middle beat: plaque discovery reweights the task from random planting to ordained ritual. Cost is visible: tired knees, dirt under nails, the “fragile” peace she dares to feel. No external antagonist, but entropy (ivy, collapse) applies coherent pressure; coincidence (bread arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete returns: vanished bakery bread = resurrection; plaque = validation of sacred-in-ordinary. No explicit moral—final lantern glow lets reader feel the repricing. Subtext sits in gestures: brushing crumbs, planting lavender beside inscription. Ambiguity lingers—will the bread keep coming?—but complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close stays stable inside Elara’s gardener perception: vines “choke,” soil “whispers,” bread crust “faintly warm.” Syntax mirrors her careful rhythm—long sentences for digging, clipped fragments when plaque is read. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within rural-botanic lexicon. Final paragraph modulates to softer cadence as light fades, achieving Charged Poise without register drift.</question>

<comment>Prose is lean and sensory-dense; most sentences do two jobs (air “thick with scent” + season marker). Minor loop: “bread…bread…bread” thrice in paragraph 3, but each mention reweights meaning, so waived. Metaphors stay physical (ivy “choked out light”) and consistent. One paraphrase pair (“fragile…fragile”) adjacent; −0.2. Closure line varies rhythm and lands clean—no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<comment>Guerrilla-gardener who harvests grace from disappeared bakery bread feels fresh, yet “sacred in the ordinary” risks proverb. Specific botanic action (lavender planted beside plaque) transforms platitude into lived ritual. Ruined palace + itinerant loaves synthesize magical realism with eco-reclamation. Risk is moderate; payoff legible. Not revolutionary, but memorable enough for literary venue.</comment>
