<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira’s longing for lost joy is anchored early and her micro-choice to kneel at the fresco fragment signals a believable pivot. Interiority stays concrete—her fingers brush stone, tears stream while she paints—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of wall-for-fog canvas is earned because the film-projected memories dramatize why preservation matters. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene; emotion is embodied but not complex enough under peak pressure to reach 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: fresco fragment → exposed film → knowledge network → fog-canvas. Each step is contiguous and the final image of glowing fog delivers visible cost (she foregoes walls forever). Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Yet escalation is gentle—one deepening, not a narrowing—so closure feels more resonant than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog operates as both atmosphere and active canvas; its shifting density literally enables the climax when Lira paints on mist. Ruined orchard is sketched with spare, POV-filtered cues—crumbling arch, damp earth—rather than catalog. Stone table and film warmth anchor tactile discovery. Final image of illuminated fog reweights the setting from dead space to living screen, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost creative joy—is declared early and intensifies when film memories force her to redefine “canvas.” One meaningful tightening: wall canvas is abandoned for fog canvas, a visible trade-off. Cost is felt (she cries, leaves walls behind) but pressure remains steady; no second beat narrows options further. Sufficient for 600-word scope but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as memory-preservation medium. Fresco fragment, exposed film, and light-painted fog form a concrete motif cluster that reweights meaning at closure. No moralizing; final image of lifting fog implies art outlives architecture. Subtext quiet but coherent—joy equals transmission, not medium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: “her eyes scanning,” “she realized.” Syntax flexes with emotional rise—long sentence for projection wonder, short bursts for painting action. No dialogue, so voice rests on rhythmic, image-rich description that avoids purple excess. Diction consistent with artist’s visual lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied, and propulsive. No scaffold loops; sentences open differently, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective—“fog-drenched ruins,” “luminous vials”—and never clusters into purple. Final line snaps shut with cadence echo of opening fog. Minor opportunity: one “seemed to shift” hedge could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing fresco, exposed film, and light-painting into a fog projection rig is a fresh synthesis of antiquity & optics. Orchard-as-memory palace trope is refreshed by making weather the canvas. Risk is moderate; payoff legible. Conceptual Repricing ending lifts it above gimmick.</comment>
