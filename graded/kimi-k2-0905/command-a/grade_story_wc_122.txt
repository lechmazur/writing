<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused hands “tracing the half-finished drum” embodies vocation and loss—but the emotional thaw is declared (“the numbness was gone”) rather than shown through contradictory body cues. The single-POV default is met; no secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Micro-choice is present (she picks up the broken needle, chooses to reverse songs), yet the shift from skepticism to desperate belief is compressed into one sentence of summary, muting the cost. Closure is earned—she weeps and taps the drum—but the causality is telescoped, not lived beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear and the unheard drumbeat crystallize a before/after with felt cost. Causal lens holds: because she fractures the needle → therefore she reverses music → therefore feeling returns. Orientation is clean at word 60; cavern, season, deafness anchored early. One soft causality gap: the legend of backward songs is asserted, not earlier seeded, so the method feels imported rather than earned from prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern functions as micro-setting: its vibrations replace sound for Elara, constraining her discovery path. Torches, stone walls, and the half-finished drum are tactile, lived-in, and return in the final image. Seasonal “rustle” is repeated twice; it mirrors internal thaw but never alters tactics—decorative, not causal. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible object moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: reversed songs begin to “surface” buried emotions, narrowing her options to keep listening or stop. Cost is conceptual (raw aliveness hurts) but not material; no tool breaks, no time lost, no social price. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of alien melodies increases until the tear arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: broken needle → broken perception → mended feeling. The “filament of hush” is named once and echoed in the mirrored cavern hush, but it never constrains choice; it’s ornamental. Final image of unheard drumbeat offers quiet conceptual repricing: silence becomes fertile, not empty. No moralizing or thesis statement; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Elara’s sensorium—she “felt the vibrations through her feet.” Diction is rhythmic, drum-like: “surface smooth yet silent,” “audibly muted tones.” No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“filament of hush”) are sparse and pattern-taught early. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: final drum-tap is one stark sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with sentence variation that echoes drum cadence. No template-cadence runs; occasional adjective pairs (“smooth yet silent”) are purposeful, not churn. One paraphrase loop: “emotional numbness had become her constant companion” + “trapped in a silence… of her own making” restate the same stasis. Otherwise high density: each sentence layers craft, stakes, or image. Closure sentence is clean, no artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The deaf music teacher reversing records to feel again is a fresh synthesis; trope of backward masking is inverted from horror to healing. Specific occupational detail—calloused hands, half-finished drum—grounds the concept. Risk taken: unheard music as climax, yet it pays off through vibration imagery. Could swap cavern for any workshop without structural break, so freshness is moderate.</comment>
