<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on damp ticket, the cracked lens as silent companion—but the interior contradiction is stated (“honesty felt risky”) rather than dramatized in body or choice until the final slide. The micro-choice of folding her own doodles carries cost, yet Kian’s instant smile flattens the relational pressure that had been promised. Secondary pressure from crystals is poetic but never alters her tactics; mistrust thaws too easily to feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: lens held to light crystallizes “something true” and reweights the cracked trust, with cost felt in the shared silence that follows. Causality is mostly accumulative: doodles → lens → offer, each beat adding density rather than forcing a because/therefore turn; the final smile is micro-turn enough for this length. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt is more than postcard: its glow and resonant hush directly mirror the ambiguously clear theme and supply the literal light for Kian’s lens moment, charging the closure image. Rain-soaked scent and damp ticket anchor body and time; spatial tracking holds as Kian approaches. Micro-setting rule met; no occupational detail required.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightens once: the folded doodle offer forecloses the option to keep hiding. Cost is present but soft—Elara’s racing heart—yet sufficient for 700-word scale. Agency sits with her; coincidence absent. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no secondary escalation needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: cracked lens = cracked trust, ambiguous clarity becomes literal light test. Final image of lens refracting truth offers non-literal answer to honesty question. Subtext in gesture (slide paper, not speak) keeps sermon at bay. Resonance built from two objects, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Elara’s registrar attention to logging and refracted light. Syntax is steady, lightly lyric, matching hush tone; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but natural (“It’s beautiful”) with subtext carried in pause and smile. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose breathes with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“ambiguously clear” recurs but is motif, not artifact. Metaphors (crystals whisper) stay coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor filter verbs (“she noticed”) are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle: night registrar using found projector lens as honesty totem in crystal forecourt. Combination feels specific, not checklist. Doodle-language as non-verbal trust bridge is lovely inflection. Could swap rain-city but not lens-ticket duo without collapse; risk level modest, yet specificity earns lift.</comment>
