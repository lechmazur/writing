<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich and vocationally specific; her blindness is shown through how she senses air shifts and refracted light rather than declared. The micro-choice to trust the drone’s hum over visual inspection crystallizes her values, yet the traveler remains a prop—not a crucible—so relationship pressure is absent. No genuine flaw complicates the repair; competence dominates struggle. Still, her calm renunciation of spectacle for craft carries a quiet, felt cost that earns the ending’s poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the drone lives, the ship sails, Elara stays—anchor metaphor re-weighted without sermonizing. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory patch adds tonal density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is conceptual but legible: she foregoes the voyage to remain the depot’s unseen anchor.</comment>

<comment>The mist-coated depot is filtered through Elara’s non-visual priorities—oil scent, chain groan, water-refraction cues—so setting is simultaneously macro (rail depot) and micro (her bench, the liquid mosaic). Spatial choreography is clean: traveler enters, relinquishes drone, departs; no floating props. Weather (mist, anchor splash) affects timing and mood but never blocks action. The glass-water installation is the star: it literally guides her patching decisions and returns in the final image, constraining her choice to stay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore trust between people and delicate tech—is declared early and tightened when the drone’s hum flicks back to life. Pressure is situational-accumulative: depot anticipation, traveler’s panic, and Elara’s self-imposed standard layer until the sonic re-hum releases tension. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single intensification suffices. Cost is quiet but real: she remains while others depart, anchoring herself to perpetual repair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from refracted light and reciprocal repair: technology and humanity mutually calibrate. The water-glass motif shifts from diagnostic tool to metaphor for Elara’s mediated perception, re-weighted when she “listens to the light” at the end. No moral is stated; the image of the unmoving artisan amid departing ships implies endurance as ethical stance. Subtext in traveler’s silent gratitude conveys societal reliance on invisible labor without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s sensorium; no POV leakage. Syntax is tactile—fingers “trace contours,” air “hangs heavy”—mirroring her haptic world. No dialogue means voice must carry idiom alone, and it does: “magnetic calm” is not a cliché in this lexicon. Refracted light as narrative lens is taught early and paid off in the final beat, legitimizing the lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled: longer sentences breathe during repair, then shorten at the hum’s return. Figurative language is sparse and integrated—“anchor of destiny,” “soul within the machine”—no mixed metaphors. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; “drone,” “hummingbird,” and “machine” are precisely alternated. Final line avoids cadence cliché by ending on the ambiguous promise of “begin again.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Blind woman + delicate drone repair is fresh, but “mist-coated rail depot” and “anchor lifts for maiden voyage” flirt with steampunk postcard. The conceptual pivot—repair as anchoring oneself—saves the piece from mere aesthetic. Risk is moderate: all action occurs in one quiet room while spectacle happens off-stage, trusting sensorial lyricism to carry tension. Transformation test passes: Elara’s specific endurance would not translate if swapped into another vocation or object.</comment>
