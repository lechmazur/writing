<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity and engineer lens are cleanly signaled, but interior contradiction is asserted (“he sought to puzzle out new equations for hope”) rather than dramatized in scene. The sextant piece triggers no micro-choice that costs him anything; the resurrecting actions are smooth but emotionally flat, so the final “equation” feels intellectual rather than earned. No conflicting impulse under pressure is shown; the arc is a single upward gradient. Fits functional band but not the 8.8+ gate for visible cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s “living exhibit” reweights the premise that dead infrastructure can still navigate human hope. Causal chain is slim—redirecting air/light is described, not demonstrated to change options—and the sextant never re-enters the final beat, so the reweighting is atmospheric rather than prop-driven. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds. Orientation is clear by word 60. One tightening only, but it is legible and the cost is felt as obsolescence accepted.</comment>

<comment>Dust-filtered dawn light, broken-window geometry, and brass gleam are selective and POV-filtered. Spaceport remains a postcard until Eli manipulates vents/mirrors; then the terminal becomes tactile—those micro-settings constrain how he can “resurrect” the space. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not charge the final image (no broken mirror shard or vent left as relic), so misses 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake = resurrect the terminal to prove hope’s equation. Pressure escalates only once: when he rigs airflow/light to create “illusion of movement.” No credible loss (time, tools, social credit) is risked; success is frictionless. The tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, so cost stays conceptual. Meets default for one meaningful deepening but not the 8.8+ visible-price gate.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—hope as engineered resurrection—emerges through the accumulating light/air images rather than authorial statement. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap, no character contradiction to complicate the thesis. Final image of terminal “preparing for another day” offers Charged Poise that reweights earlier abandonment. Avoids moralizing, but the insight is single-note; ambiguity is minimal.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Eli; perceptual signature is restrained engineer-POV—“redirected flows,” “patterns in chaos”—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for survey, clipped fragments when “idea struck.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction stays within intern lexicon; occasional elevated phrases (“relic of a bygone era”) read as permitted lyric uplift rather than register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, scaffold-free; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—“maze of intentions” is the prompt phrase, reused judiciously. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. One paraphrase risk: “remnants of old dreams could spark new ones” echoes prior sentence but adds temporal sweep, tolerated. Information density high; each sentence advances setting or motive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—reviving an abandoned spaceport after carnival departs—offers fresh temporal vantage (post-event) and engineer-intern hero rarely seen. Execution drifts toward familiar ruin-porn lyricism; resurrection method (mirrors, vents) is low-grade maker fantasy without surprising constraint. Sextant piece promised steampunk navigation twist but functions only as talisman. Specific detail is present, yet the conceptual risk stays safe; no rule or world logic is upended.</comment>
