<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority drifts between lyric abstraction and therapeutic self-exposition (“otherworldly sentimentalist” is label-only; no embodied contradiction surfaces). The gear-touch beats are passive meditation, not micro-choices that foreclose paths; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Earned stasis is hinted but the refusal/fire renunciation never shows up as a live fork on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift of light-spill substitutes for causal reversals, and the final image reweights the stake (light without burn). Orientation is lyric-cloudy but disorientation is taught early and pays off in the closing glow, so waiver applies. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—“light that did not burn but embraced”—yet the absence of a visible, personal price keeps it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Nebula garden is evoked with selective, synaesthetic sensory layering; the bioluminescent petals and liquid-silver spill constrain Elara’s tactile route and supply the final image. Micro-setting (the gear’s teeth, the haptic bloom-glow) functions as geography, guiding her hand and charging the last beat. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single continuous scene; no floating-room syndrome or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightens once when the gear begins to pulse, but the escalation is atmospheric density rather than a narrowing fork. No visible price or lost option is dramatized; the garden simply brightens. Coincidence is avoided, yet agency feels observational rather than decisive, keeping pressure just under the 8-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of non-consuming illumination emerges through the returning petal-light image rather than explicit thesis, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext resides in the gear’s silent teeth and the garden’s hush, avoiding moralizing. The final sentence reweights the premise without slogans, achieving quiet resonance, though the absence of a lived personal loss keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, slightly elevated register that matches Elara’s ethereal POV; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature favors chromatic and tactile diction (“liquid silver,” “quiet sigh”) that differentiates the narrator from generic omniscience. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of “sonar pinging” without syntactic monotony. Dialogue is absent by design; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences layer image with emotional charge. Occasional soft overlays (“quiet sigh of falling petals” twice in 100 words) create micro-loop paraphrase, but artifacts never touch the closure beat or obscure causality. Metaphors stay coherent within the nebula logic; no register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “light without fire” premise repackages a familiar ecological metaphor, but the sonar-pinging memory-transit mechanic and infinity-gear as silent conduit feel fresh and specific. Synthesis of cyber-relic with bioluminescent garden avoids stock tropes; the final image reconfigures the premise rather than decorating it. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence stays high.</comment>
