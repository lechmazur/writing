<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The micro-choices on the scroll—tracing, hesitating, erasing—are tangible under pressure, but the interiority slips into label-speak (“a master of calibrated treason,” “the pain still raw”) that tells rather than dramatizes. The contradictory impulse is present—erase versus forgive—but the epiphany leans therapeutic rather than embodied. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation is legible and carries felt cost, satisfying the 600-word closure bar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is cleanly anchored by word 60; the rose thorn and scroll are taught as causal props. The lens is Causal: each stroke of the thorn literally dissolves ink and rewrites possibility. Closure lands with visible cost—the blank scroll—so the Decisive Change is on-page. However, escalation is gentle (one gradual fade) and the “key with no lock” mechanic is asserted rather than demonstrated or constrained earlier; that softens the tightness expected for 8+.</comment>

<comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora light, and stalactite metronome are sensory-filtered through Elara’s bias toward texture and drip-rhythm. The rose thorn functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is minimalist but stable; no impossible moves. Economy is good—three anchors reused (marble, thorn, drip). The environment does not actively block or supply resources beyond atmosphere, so it stays just below the 8-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she erase the letter and forgive—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the first visible word fade forecloses revenge and commits her to forgiveness. Cost is legible—blank parchment equals lost history—but the tightening is single-gear; no secondary obstacle or resource lost. Coincidence absent; no antagonist. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a second pressure point keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the thorn’s reconfiguration: what can unmake can also mend. Subtext lives in the disappearing ink rather than exposition. Final image of “canvas” reweights prior forged histories without moralizing. The idea is coherent, non-trivial, and invites reflection; ambiguity is controlled. Lacks a second motif to deepen resonance, capping it short of 8+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays consistent, with perceptual signature in tactile precision (“calloused fingers,” “crystalline teeth”). Syntax modulates—long breath for aurora, clipped for thorn strokes. No dialogue, so voice convergence not tested. Diction stays within plausible forger lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm aligns with drip cadence, supporting momentum. Minor drift toward oratory in the final paragraph prevents 8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—many sentences do two jobs (image + interior). Figurative control is good except one mixed metaphor (“threads of truth from the fabric of time”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Passive constructions are rare and justified. Typos absent. The single metaphor muddle keeps it just below 7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Forging-as-forgiveness is fresh, but “thorn that unwrites” leans fairy-tale familiar. Sanctuary + aurora + drip is atmospheric yet not conceptually risky. The blank-scroll payoff feels inevitable, not surprising. Specificity of calligraphy trade lends authenticity. No close echoes of famous lines. Boldness is moderate; innovation resides in emotional rather than structural risk.</comment>
