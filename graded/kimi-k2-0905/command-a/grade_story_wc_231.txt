<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quietly obsessive need to “decode” the stranger’s gift gives every beat direction; the boutonnière is handled repeatedly and ties directly to the final acceptance of guardianship. Interiority stays concrete (“he closed his eyes, letting the memory…wash over him”) and his micro-choice to kneel, touch the print, then claim the journal visibly escalates commitment. No contradiction under pressure; flaw is the absence of any second character to create status tension, but solo POV is coherent. Closure renunciation—he will keep memories that aren’t his—pays an earned cost framed by prior因果.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Acc cumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, scent, print, journal, and beam form a dense echo-chain whose final cadence—beam slicing fog while Elias holds both relics—reweights “remember” from puzzle to vocation. Orientation locked by word 80; causality intact: finding the fresh print → kneel → journal → guardianship. Middle lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an alternate path (he could have burned the journal, etc.), so escalation is present but mild; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: borrowed memories now lodged in a new keeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Opal dock, mist, lantern posts, boot print, and lighthouse beam are tactically woven through action rather than listed; each new detail is noticed because Elias searches, satisfying economy. Micro-setting of the dock planks constrains his movement and literally supports the evidence beats. Nautical twilight is named early and returns in the final sweep of light, charging the last image. No credibility slips; spatial choreography clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias accept custodianship of alien memories?—signalled on page 1. One meaningful deepening: discovery of journal moves puzzle from flower to full life story, tightening obligation. Cost is present but abstract (lifelong caretaking); no tangible sacrifice on page keeps it from 8.8 band. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: each found object thickens atmospheric weight and moral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges through handling of concrete objects rather than exposition. Final beam-image reweights “remember” from stranger’s plea to Elias’s self-assigned mission, achieving resonant reconfiguration without moral statement. Subtext resides in silent choices: kneel, lift, tuck under arm—no internal lecture needed. Near 8.5 but slight over-articulation in line “borrowed memories—that’s what the stranger had carried” nudges theme toward surface.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s lighthouse-trained eye—gaps, beams, plank intervals. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for mist-laden contemplation, clipped fragments when print is found. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Filter verbs minimal and justified; prose texture remains distinctly maritime-reticent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information-dense: one sentence often sets mood plus advances plot (“The mist clung… but not his resolve”). Metaphors stay single-track (“mist… like a second skin”) and do not stack. Minor scaffold: repeated “softly persistent” phrase acts as intended motif but appears three times in identical form; loses some musical freshness. No clarity or closure obscured, so remains above 7.7 floor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: treats memory as transferable cargo that must be portaged by strangers; lighthouse becomes transit warehouse, not mere sentinel. Integration ofEdelweiss into maritime gothic frame feels idiosyncratic rather than token exotic. Risk is moderate—quiet, accumulative structure—but payoff justifies choice. Not quite 8.5 because premise could swap flower for any portable relic without breaking logic, trimming irreplaceability.</comment>
