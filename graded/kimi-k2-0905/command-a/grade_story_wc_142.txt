<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s “culture-shock absorber” label is asserted, never dramatized; we are told she’s exhausted but see no contradictory impulses under pressure. The foundation-stone moment supplies a warm tingle, yet her ensuing tactics (reorganize rounds, stage festival) read as managerial rather than embodied crisis. Interiority lapses into stock phrasing (“burned brighter than ever”) and no visible flaw complicates her path; the ending renunciation is projected, not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chip → graffiti trail → festival rally → symbolic placement. Closure lands as Charged Poise (stone at festival center reweights communal identity) with felt conceptual cost (gentrification still looms). However, escalation is front-loaded; middle beats repeat “she found more graffiti” without tightening options. Orientation is clean; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The raft city’s “jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation” is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Lira’s priorities. Festival-night color dynamics directly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent; barges, lanterns, distances track. A few carnival clichés (“whispered promises,” “stars twinkled”) dull specificity but not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective survival vs. privatization—is signaled early and returns at every graffiti beat. One meaningful tightening: Festival of Lights turns passive art into active defiance, foreclosing Vorin’s timeline. Cost is communal, not personal; Lira herself pays no visible price, which limits upper band. Pressure stays coherent under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: dual allegiance to sea & community reframed through graffiti folk-archive. Final image (stone amid living murals) offers non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext in Vorin’s corporate banners vs. handmade colors is efficient. No echoing thesis statements; only mild abstraction in “beacon of possibility” final clause.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps consistent psychic distance; diction remains within Lira’s observant, logistical bent. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for crowd sweep, clipped ones for Vorin’s dismissal—supporting emotional peaks. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice never drifts into over-precision or corporate register. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature adequate but not strikingly idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, concise, and mostly propulsive; sensory detail woven through action. Occasional soft fillers (“strange warmth spread,” “hues of amber and gold”) and one scaffold pair (“whispered… promises… profit opportunity”) slightly dilute density. No mixed metaphors, loops, or tense slips; opening and closing images land crisply. Artifact level stays below closure-interference threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Floating graffiti-insurrection twist on gentrification tale feels fresh; stone-as-memory-USB is a neat micro-invention. Accumulation beats feel inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plot. Some carnival/sea tropes remain familiar, but synthesis with found-art archive gives distinct angle. Risk is moderate; execution competent, not radically experimental.</question>
