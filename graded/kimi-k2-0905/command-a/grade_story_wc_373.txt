<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is serviceable—her vow to “capture the sound of trust breaking” is a vivid, character-specific motive—but the story never lets us feel the moment that sound actually registers; instead, she simply declares the truce “frayed” at dawn. Her micro-choices (refusing the flask, challenging the necklace man) align with her steadfast label yet stay rhetorical: no embodied fear, no sensory cost, no visible mistake. The heirloom pivots from clue to talisman without altering her tactics; she ends where she began—guardian of hush—so no path is foreclosed. The flaw is emotional summarization in peak beats, not contradiction, hence the mid-6 hold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is intact—fob left as taunt → Lila interrogates market → confrontation forces thieves to back down—but escalation is verbal brinkmanship only; the actual moonshine never reappears, so the “thwart” is announced, not dramatized. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila keeps the truce by walking away, sunrise sealing the stalemate. Cost is conceptual (trust permanently cracked) rather than felt—no lost resource, no wound, no new obligation—so the repricing is legible but thin. The lens holds; the missing tightening of on-page consequence caps the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The rotting-pier market is sketched with salt-and-decay odor, hushed acoustics, and proximate bodies; spatial choreography stays clean as Lila threads booths and confronts the necklace man. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the watch fob itself functions as micro-setting: its engraved design is finger-traced, matched, and finally clenched, charging the dawn-image. Weather or tide never intrude, yet the pier’s physical jeopardy (planks, darkness) is implied rather than leveraged for choice—hence no 9-level constraint. Still, the environment supplies both texture and the heirloom prop that anchors closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—preserve the truce and her father’s name—signals early and tightens only rhetorically: each encounter restates the risk without narrowing Lila’s options or exacting a visible price. The “until sunrise” clock is named but not tracked; dawn arrives as symbolic curtain, not lived deadline. No credible loss (time, flask, blood, social credit) alters her tactics; the thieves’ retreat feels convenient rather than compelled. Agency stays rhetorical—she rewrites rules by declaration—so escalation misses the felt-cost threshold for 7+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-currency emerges through the heirloom’s circulation and the market’s hush-culture rather than authorial sermon, culminating in the quiet crack of dawn. Subtext is strongest in dialogue indirection: the necklace man’s sneer conceals recognition, the fortune-teller’s warning carries market-wide guilt. The final image—Lila clutching the fob while silence holds—offers resonant ambiguity: trust is broken yet business continues. No late thesis line appears, avoiding echo penalty; only the mid-7 tier reflects theme’s thin embedding in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lila’s perceptual filter—“shadows and whispers,” “salt and decay”—with controlled psychic distance. Compression in peak beats (“Everything,” she said, stepping closer) mirrors her curt resolve, though syntax occasionally drifts into editorial uplift (“truths here are slippery things”). No head-hop; diction stays within a pier-raised teen’s ken. Voice distinctiveness is moderate—no idiosyncratic idiom—but rhythmic restraint supports the hush-tone, earning upper-7 adequacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often slots setting, tone, and motive (“The air smelled of salt and decay as she slipped past vendors...”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“comforting unease,” “fragile truce of hush”) nudges register drift but does not clog urgency. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, without figurative muddle—meets the 7+ bar, falls short of 9+ by micro-flares of lyric inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The moonshine-under-pier economy is familiar noir turf; freshness lies in Lila’s non-violent “verbal thwart” and the sonic metaphor of trust-breaking, yet the beat itself is off-stage. Heirloom-as-taunt and hush-truce are clever syntheses, but neither is pushed to an irreversible outcome. Risk level is moderate—no structural experiment—yielding a solid but not startling 6.8.</comment>
