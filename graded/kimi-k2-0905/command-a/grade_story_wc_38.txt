<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s calm-defiance signature pulses through embodied beats—fingers brushing damp walls, dice warming in her palm—each micro-choice tightening her resolve. The interior contradiction between fragility and encryption crystallizes in the dance where she “encrypts vulnerability as strength” on-page. Closure carries earned cost: the lab awakened, she now bears guardianship with no exit shown. A hairline slip: “lyrical code breaker” is told once, never re-shown via diction or rhythm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dance decisively awakens the laboratory, reweighting sunken despair into living archive with visible cost—guardianship assumed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of decay → dance → revelation, each image layer tightening stakes without causal gimmicks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by phrase three; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “as the spider completes its web” re-explains time already felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory constrains every move—water drip metronome, moss-covered walls guiding fingertips to dice, pedestal height forcing bodily dance. Hangman’s dice evolve from talisman to kinetic partner, their worn edges fitting finger pads mid-gesture; this micro-setting charges the final awakening. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: smell of decay narrows to touch of dice, then widens to shifting walls. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across chamber shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate buried knowledge—tightens once: journal-of-dance demands bodily translation, no alternate route provided. Escalation is Accumulative: density of symbols → body risk → architectural response; cost felt as irreversible guardianship. Calm defiance keeps agency internal; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence absent; all pressure sourced from her choice to dance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: encryption of fragility into power, enacted not stated. Final image of guardian poised in awakened lab reweights earlier decay into resilient archive without moral. Subtext lives in dice—objects of death recycled as keys—resonating quietly. No thesis line; only one near-echo “encrypt vulnerability as strength” kept because dramatized immediately.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains distanced awe, syntax lengthening during submerged description, then fragmenting mid-dance: “Her body began to move, fluid and deliberate”—rhythm mimics tide. Diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon—codes, symbols, breath—no academic leakage. No dialogue; voice remains singular. Filter verbs absent; perception direct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence swells and contracts with dive vs. dance beats; no template repeats. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“shadows danced upon crumbling walls” sets tone then yields to concrete gesture. One mixed metaphor: “breadcrumb in a forest” amid oceanic lab jars slightly. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, precise paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dance-as-cipher refreshingly reverses usual code-breaking trope; body becomes decryption tech organically. Sunken lab + hangman’s dice fuse death, chance, knowledge into fresh constellation. Final guardian stance grows inevitably from established dice-partner and dance unlock. Minor echo of “awaken the laboratory” trope, but specific kinesthetic method rescues it.</comment>
