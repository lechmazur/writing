<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Eliard’s earnest naiveté is shown through concrete micro-choices—scrubbing rust, humming droplet rhythms—yet the interiority slides into gentle summary (“he wondered if his efforts would be enough”). A visible cost is present (the scar-crack), but the cosmic imbalance remains atmospheric rather than dramatized as internal contradiction under acute pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: droplet cadence and bell-repair repeat until the first wave reweights the stake. Closure lands with a felt Conceptual Repricing—the single wave reframes the world’s stillness—yet the cost is symbolic rather than tactical. Causality is poetic, not mechanical; the viaduct’s “agreement” is charming but unanchored in rule-based consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sapphire viaduct crystalline arches, dew intervals, brittle alloy—details are selective and filtered through Eliard’s amateur-mage perception. The setting constrains the final image: the bell must hang from the lowest arch where droplets fall, linking micro-setting to closure. No orientation drift; locale and time signalled within 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake— restoring planetary motion via bell— is signaled early; escalation is textural: droplet rhythm intensifies emotionally until the first wave tightens the cadence. No tactical trade-off is forced; the cost is symbolic (visible scar). Agency is present yet gentle—Eliard’s endurance succeeds on first attempt without setback that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of brittle devotion emerges through the bell’s scar and the alloy’s fragility; no explicit moralizing. Final image of rising waves offers resonant, non-literal answer—movement returns but is still small, ambiguous. Subtext resides in tactile objects rather than stated thesis; the cosmic imbalance stays poetic rather than ethically complicated, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Eliard’s sensory filter: “lukewarm mage” is never spelled out academically, preserving modest lexicon. Rhythm mimics droplet cadence—short sentence clusters then longer lyrical lifts. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect stays clean. Voice remains consistent; no head-hop or register drift. Final line lightens prosody to match uplifted stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“the bell’s halves seemed to whisper”). High information density—each sentence layers observation with emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “its crystalline arches reflecting hues of pale blue and lavender” could trim one modifier, but this is hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ecological fable with artisanal restoration feels fresh; “understanding dripping rates” as magical method is specific, not generic. The bell-crack reweighting at closure creates inevitable-in-hindsight turn. Risks quiet lyricism over dramatic reversal; premise avoids stockChosen-One template. Slight safety in success-on-first-try, muting boldness.</comment>
