<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her “mulberry ache” gives a visceral signature—and her micro-choice to play the violin seeds the climax. Yet the telepathy trait is asserted, not dramatized: we never see a plant’s message complicate or cost her a decision, so the gift feels decorative. The final renunciation (opaque violin, silent plants) lands as Earned Stasis, but the emotional price is named rather than shown in body or gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the violin’s song rewrites the air, Dominion scouts freeze, and the relic goes opaque—an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each coffee-stain image and plant murmur layers density until the single sonic release. The “tree split at its core” stain is a tight causal seed that flowers in the final root-riot, proving set-ups were kept.</comment>

<comment>The velvet observatory is more than wallpaper: its balcony grants the only line-of-sight to the prowling scouts, forcing the violin to be played aloud, hence the stakes. Midsummer heat and nightshade scent steep the tension, while the crystalline violin’s transparency lets starlight refract onto the agents—an environmental cue that guides Elara’s timing. The setting’s sensory hierarchy (scent → sound → light) tightens the beat sequence, earning its closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—arrives early and tightens through the coffee-stain glimpses; each swirl forecloses false comfort. Escalation is textural: plant whispers grow urgent, stains darken from abstract to arboreal, violin hum accelerates from curiosity to weapon. The single decisive release (playing the violin) pays the accumulating dread, but the price (instrument dies, ache remains) is stated more than dramatized, keeping the score just shy of 8+ bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the perforated destiny is literalized as rips in air mended by sonic force, then as the violin’s own mortal crack. The mulberry ache reweights the victory—harmony bought by fragility, not triumph. No character articulates “truth vs. control”; instead, the opaque corpse-violin is the conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and POV-strict: “velvet observatory,” “perforated destiny,” and “mulberry ache” form a private lexicon that never leaks into explanatory exposition. Syntax swells and contracts with tension—long, scent-laden clauses collapse into the staccato “Propagate. Protect. Prevail.” No head-hop, no filter-verb fat, and the faint archaic diction suits the fable-frame without sounding costume-shop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is sensorily dense yet propulsive; however, two stacked metaphors in the climax (“mend the perforations in the air itself” + “roots twisting as if awakened”) blur the physical logic of what the sound actually does. A minor paraphrase loop—“the violin was more than an object; it was a key, a whisper…”—recycles the same claim without new angle. Otherwise, cadence breathes with the beat, and the final line’s quiet diminuendo lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ice-crystal violin as sonic weapon/destiny-seam ripper is a fresh synthesis; the telepathy-plants channel is equally odd yet kept subordinate to the emotional core, avoiding gimmick. Risk—lyric accumulation over causal reversals—pays off when the opaque husk-violin reprises the initial transparency with inverted meaning. The only echo risk is a faint “tree roots” motif that nods to familiar eco-fantasy, but the acoustic mechanism rescues it from cliché.</comment>
