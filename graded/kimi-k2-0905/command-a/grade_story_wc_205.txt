<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—romantic visionary vs. exiled scholar—drives every beat; the shard beats in her pocket anchor micro-choices (“she carefully arranged the shard”). Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Final endurance carries visible cost: she walks away still wounded, shard glowing yet unhealed. Flaws complicate rather than decorate; competence is balanced by genuine social erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram etched on the shard reweights her theory and social position. Causal chain holds—storm → shard ritual → data → concession—without convenient amnesia. Cost is legible: “tears…of burnished sorrow” and lingering personal wounds. One scaffold clause (“She knew the shard was more than a trinket…”) is redundant, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid is rendered through kinetic sensory filters (“gilded spires,” “torrents of luminescence”) that pressure action. Micro-setting succeeds: the shard’s facets literally constrain the ritual by refracting storm-light onto mirrors. Spatial choreography clean; mirrors and cloth positions track intact. Slight over-painting in third paragraph slows momentum a hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove “temporal plasticity” and reclaim self—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Empiricists seal the Hall, forcing covert entry and risk of permanent exile. Escalation causal under Causal lens: because they block, therefore she trespasses, therefore stakes heighten. Price visible: she trespasses alone, loses professional safe-ground, exits still scarred.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: shard-light = possibility of rewriting history, mirrored self = risk of narcissistic erasure. No explicit moral; final whispered poem is image, not thesis. “Burnished sorrow” reframes triumph as partial recovery, resisting tidy redemption. Slight thematic echo in final clause (“the enduring power of reimagining”) is mild but not sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara with consistent perceptual signature: she sees “tiny rainbows,” hears “winds…of the baroque asteroid.” Diction poetic yet within her scholarly lexicon; cadence modulates with storm surge. One filter-verb cluster (“she believed…she hoped…she knew”) mid-story dulls immediacy slightly. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences breathe during calms, tighten during trespass. High information density—each sentence advances premise or stakes. Two near-paraphrases (“a civilization that had crumbled eons ago” / “the civilization lost”) create minor loop; not at closure. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-of-light archaeology on baroque asteroid + mirror-covering ritual. Transformation test passes—plot needs gilded asteroid and light-storm physics. Temporal plasticity as scientific heresy feels non-obvious. Risk of ornate texture is embraced and paid off. Echoes of “archaeology of the unseen” recall Calvino but rethreaded through personal redemption arc.</comment>
