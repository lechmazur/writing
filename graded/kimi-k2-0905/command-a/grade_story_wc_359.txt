<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—synesthetic seeing-sound is shown, not labelled—but the childhood vow is delivered as retrospective summary rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. Micro-choices (ringing bells, stepping back) align with motive, yet no visible flaw or doubt complicates the final act; success feels pure, cost-free. Earned stasis is present but lightly priced; still, the prism-song perceptual signature is vivid and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: amber sheet → bell strike → aurora conduit → ice-hush incarnation, each beat a because/therefore step. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—silence reframed as living possibility—visible in the line “stillness was not the absence of sound but the presence of possibility,” with felt cultural cost for her village. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity. One soft spot: the sculptor-chisel cue is off-stage and thinly motivated, a minor teleport of external timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ice cavern is more than postcard: shifting aurora colors actively supply the magic conduit; fractured ice floor crunches underfoot, constraining movement. Prism-song bells and amber sheet act as micro-setting objects that must be handled exactly; their tactile handling is on-page. Final image reweights the cavern itself—“walls softening”—so environment charges closure. Selective, sense-driven detail never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate wonder—is signaled early and personally. Tightening occurs when the first bell strike spills sunlight, narrowing options: once started, the ritual must complete; reversal is impossible. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—village worldview will shift—but the price is not dramatized on her body/choice in-scene. Pressure stays coherent; one meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: wonder as oxygen, silence as fertile void, reframed through color-sound synesthesia. Motif of “sculpted hush” evolves from abstract idea to living entity, reweighting prior material. No moralizing final sentence; resonance is imagistic. Minor abstraction in “certify it as essential” keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s synesthetic channel; no head-hop. Diction stays within her perceptual lexicon—“liquid sunlight,” “sharpened teeth”—creating rhythmic, sensory prose. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate. One register lift (“promise of stillness”) is poetic but consistent with lyric mode taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; short percussive clauses mimic bell strikes, longer liquid lines mirror aurora swirl. Mixed-metaphor risk in “liquid sunlight trapped within ancient resin” is justified by synesthetic lens. No synonym loops; each sensory noun is specific. One scaffold phrase—“the cavern seemed to hold its breath”—is stock, but it sits early, not at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of synesthesia + ice cavern + living silence feels fresh, not checklist. Prism-song bell ringing as ritual technology is specific to this world. The sculptor-chisel timing device is a novel external clock rarely used in fantasy miniatures. While “wonder as necessity” is familiar, the color-sound enactment makes the concept new.</comment>
