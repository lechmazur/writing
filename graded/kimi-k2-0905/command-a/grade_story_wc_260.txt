<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“sense of vulnerability she had never known”) rather than embodied contradiction; the tail-tip talisman reweights meaning, yet no micro-choice on the page actually risks or forfeits anything, so the renunciation feels asserted, not dramatized. Emotional labels outnumber visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—tail on shelf, new pattern of tools—but the causal engine is retrospective summary: the con is already exposed, so the “reconstruction” beat is purely declarative. One shard only; orientation clear by word 60; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the cost is only metaphorical (“layers peeled”), not tactile or irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Misty cedar workshop and starlight filter through Elara’s handler gaze; the micro-setting of her cupped hands and re-ordered tools anchors the final image. Sensory selection is biased toward her vocation—earth, cedar, nocturnal hum—so environment doubles as emotional barometer without tourist cataloging. Could reach 9 if weather or spatial access had constrained her final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still trust her vocation after the con—announced early, but pressure is ambient memory, not an on-page test: no live option is foreclosed, no creature or visitor forces a decision. The single “tightening” is the symbolic rearrangement of tools; escalation is tonal layering, not rising risk. Cost is interior ambiance, not observable forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilient epistemology emerges through the chameleon image—camouflage as both betrayal and survival—without moralizing. Final re-shelving reweights the tail from wound to witness, supplying quiet resonance. Ambiguity lingers: she may be re-armoring rather than healing, inviting re-reading. Loses top band because insight is softly articulated rather than paid for by an irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—feather shimmer, scale rustle—syntax lengthens and softens under starlight, then tightens when she moves to the shelf. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction remains within a field-naturalist lexicon; rhythm mirrors her slowed breath then decisive placement. Distinctive without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, read-aloud fluid; only minor scaffold (“layers of…layers of…”) and one mixed metaphor (“quiet reminder of fragile convictions”). No loops near closure; final sentence lands with cadence lift. Density strong—most lines do two jobs. Could trim two adjectives (“shimmering stillness” repeated) to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Wildlife-handler betrayal via chameleon camouflage offers fresh angle on trust-repair; tail-tip as keepsake talisman feels specific rather than symbolic graft. Still, the interior arc—hurt→reflection→symbolic reorder—follows a familiar healing template without external complication, capping originality at competent but not startling.</comment>
