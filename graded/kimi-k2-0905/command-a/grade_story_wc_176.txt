<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. tenderness—shows in every touch of rope and metal; the “snowmelt ardor” line crystallizes her thaw under pressure. Motive (preserve forgotten names) is constant, yet the story withholds any micro-choice that could fail or cost her materially; the illumination succeeds exactly as hoped, so the arc is emotional confirmation rather than earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak, but the absence of a visible price on the page keeps her change shy of high-band “felt cost.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: discovery of card → re-braid rope → illumination → aurora flare, each step a because/therefore pivot. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rope and rising melody reconfigure meaning while the “spark of hope” cost is felt, not declared. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The only bar to 9+ is that the final cost is atmospheric rather than a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glacial walls, aurora pulses, pine-frost scent—details filter through Elara’s artisan eye and kinesthetic rope work. The ceremonial rope operates as micro-setting that constrains every finger placement, then charges the final glow. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible shifts. Environment never stalls momentum; each sensory pick advances the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect forgotten names via melody—is signaled early and tightens once: the rope must be rewoven correctly or the memory stays buried. Escalation is accumulative: each braid loosened adds luminous density rather than new external risk. Cost is aesthetic (the aurora’s final flare) rather than a lost opportunity; this keeps pressure legible but not viscerally foreclosed, capping the band just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through fragile craft emerges from rope, metal, and aurora imagery; no character moralizes. The final image—her own name singing—reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext of self-forgiveness is implied in “snowmelt ardor,” never named. Resonance is quiet but undeniable; only the faintest whiff of thematic echo in “spark of hope” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, mimicking wax-caster focus: “technical gentleness,” “echoes of memories.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with braid rhythm; no filter-verb clutter. Aurora imagery recurs with shifting color, teaching the pattern early. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no register drift. A single POV holds without leakage; perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with braid motion; sentence variety avoids cadence loops. Figurative language is sparse but apt—“frozen cathedral,” “whispered secrets”—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and tool detail. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only minor adjectival softening (“shimmering veil”) prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lost-wax craft, punched-card music, and Inuit-style aurora sanctum feels fresh; not a template reboot. Risk-taking is lyrical rather than plot-subversive, but coherence stays intact. Specificity of rope-braid mechanics and auroral optics counters abstraction. Transformation test passes: swap artisan trade or relic and the emotional engine collapses. Slight deduction for relying on romantic aurora trope without inversion.</comment>
