<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle curiosity is credibly embodied, but his interiority drifts into abstract labels—“a love so profound that it had outlived its origin”—without contradictory impulse or visible cost. The final stasis is only a quiet closure of the case; no path is foreclosed and no price is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical reprise—the stars “shimmer brighter”—but the Decisive Change is off-stage (the tapestry is simply understood) and no causal constraint or cost is legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final reweighting is too delicate to satisfy the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velveteen gloom, damp-earth scent, and the cobalt silo’s grain-dust ghostliness are selectively vivid. The silo-as-sanctuary never constrains action or charges the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is tonally coherent and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes—“to give voice to the voiceless”—stay abstract; the only tightening is Elias finishing the untangling, which neither narrows options nor extracts a price. Pressure is aesthetic, not operative under the Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as texture without cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting forgotten intentions emerges through image rather than assertion, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit sentiment—“a reminder that even in death, intentions endure”—triggering a −0.4 echo penalty. The reprise is pleasing yet not conceptually repriced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hushed, elegiac rhythm; diction stays within gardener-perception (“threads…like the lives of those buried”). No dialogue to test, and no head-hopping; filter-verb clusters are minimal, but syntactic parallelism (“a…a…a…”) softens peak pressure, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors are coherent—“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”—and propel mood without purple excess. Minor scaffold in repeated “a scent he had grown to love”-type anaphora and two instances of simultaneous participle openers; no artifact touches the closing line, so Non-closure Cap is −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tapestry-as-emotional-map is a fresh inflection on found-object stories, yet the absence of any counter-force or risk makes the concept feel safe. Graveyard + relic + starlit silo is an elegant synthesis, but the stakes never mutate, so ingenuity stays mid-high rather than exceptional.</comment>
