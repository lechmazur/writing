<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied; the leaf as mirror is a sustained, contradiction-laden image that drives her micro-choices. The shift from control to surrender is visible in tactile rearranging of pots, not just summary. “Circuitously sincere” is shown via her winding self-interrogation, not labeled. Cost is felt: the leaf dissolves, her clothes are drenched, the nursery’s governance is relinquished—an earned stasis that forecloses the old life.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is accumulative/textural: leaf-touch → rain cadence → pot-shuffling density tightens until the final charged poise. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the vanished leaf and sun-shaft re-weight “control” to “surrender” with conceptual cost. No causal break; escalation is pattern-deepening, not reversal, appropriate to the lens.</comment>

<comment>Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: first barrier, then gateway, finally tactile prop she leans against while soaked—literally supports her transformed stance. Rain’s scent and drumbeat narrow perception in real time, guiding her hand motions. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The trellis + storm together constrain the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she surrender control?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the leaf’s warmth forces the decision to rearrange pots. Cost is visible: drenched clothes, dissolved leaf, nursery order sacrificed. Agency pure: no outside rescue. Under accumulative lens, the deepening sensory density is sufficient escalation; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern—leaf, rain, trellis, pots—rather than statement. Final sunlight re-prices “control” without moralizing. Metamorphosis is enacted, not named; ambiguity lingers (did the leaf absorb into skin?). Emotional after-effect is concrete: lighter soaked body vs prior cage. No thesis sentence; avoids pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays strictly in Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax grows shorter under rain-pressure, mirroring breath. “Circuitously sincere” voice shows in spiraling hypotactic thoughts that tighten to fragments as she acts. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on internal diction—succeeds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with storm: long damp sentences early, staccato rearranging beats late. No loops or scaffold; “rainwater” / “storm” repetitions are purposeful motif reinforcement. Metaphors (leaf as messenger) stay consistent and physically coherent. High information density: one sentence often does scent + action + interior tilt. Minor purple tinge in “kissed by the rain” but forgiven as it pays off in closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: botanical nursery owner’s metamorphosis triggered by a single leaf, not grand trauma. Reluctant surrender trope is inverted—she surrenders TO chaos, not FROM it. Risk is lyric accumulative structure; pays off. Could be sharper: “leaf as mirror” is faintly familiar, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>
