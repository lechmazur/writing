<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“seasonally mute” becomes a lived silence—but her contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final walk-off is graceful yet costs nothing we can touch. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path; the iceberg sculpting is ritual, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as quiet Charged Poise: the spinning iceberg refracts sunlight, reweighting the premise that wonder must be remade each winter. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; the lens holds, yet the beat where sculpture “takes shape” is summarized, not stepped through, so the cost feels conceptual rather than irrevocable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Whispering Bluff above clouds is atmospherically vivid—thin air, stone table hewn from native rock, glistening ice—but spatial choreography is vague; we never know where bells hang relative to precipice. The iceberg fragment as micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet environment never constrains a visible tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“preserve the color of wonder”—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete resource is risked or lost. Pressure intensifies only via lyric accumulation of light, not through narrowed options or a trade-off that hurts; escalation is aesthetic, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: impermanence as the only permanence. Final image of dimming fragment wrapped for next winter reprises the motif without preaching. Yet the insight is stated twice (“moments of wonder…fleeting,” “symphony…a journey”), slightly thinning subtextual charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with patterned diction of hush, shimmer, and breath. Perceptual signature—Elara’s tactile attention to resonance—remains intact. Occasional elevated register (“cerulean expanse,” “frozen tears of the gods”) nudges toward purple but stays within lyric contract; no head-hopping or distance wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; sentence openings avoid monotony. Several soft loops—“moments of wonder…wonder…wonder,” “symphony…symphonies”—dull edge; “glisten” appears four times without re-inflection. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked, reducing density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of kinetic sculpture + seasonally mute bell-tuner + cloud-top bluff feels idiosyncratic and memorable; trope inversion lies in tuning truth rather than sound. Risk is lyric stillness rather than plot twist, but specificity anchors it. Iceberg-as-mirror refracts rather than merely symbolizes, keeping freshness alive.</comment>
