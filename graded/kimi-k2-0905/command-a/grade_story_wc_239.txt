<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witness’s interiority is lyrically textured (“wanderingly exact” as repeated perceptual signature), but contradictions never collide in-scene; choices are obediently abstract, so the promised cost feels conceptual rather than lived. No micro-choice visibly risks failure or loss; the dictionary floats away consequence-free, muting the arc from passive seer to active unifier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary merging with the mural crystallizes “spiral arbitration” into a universe-scale reweighting, felt cost signaled by temple tremor and hush-to-harmony shift. Orientation anchors early; causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught and coherent at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library corridors, mural stone, pages that rearrange under fingertips—each tactile detail is filtered through the witness’s hieratic attention, turning setting into cognitive instrument. The softcover dictionary operates as micro-setting that constrains every beat; its final fusion with the mural directly charges the resonant image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cosmic illusion versus personal cost—is declared early but never tightens; escalation is atmospheric (glow, tremor, hush) rather than option-narrowing. No visible price is exacted from the witness; the resolution arrives as beneficent epiphany, so pressure feels cosmic-scale abstract, not personal-trade-off sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic unity versus illusion emerges through the dictionary’s shifting definitions and the spiral mural, avoiding overt moral. Final image reweights prior motifs (dictionary, hush, spiral) into a resonant non-literal answer; ambiguity lingers without confusion, earning its quiet transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains hieratic, hush-toned diction that never breaks register; syntax coils like the spiral it describes. Perceptual signature is distinct—lexicon of “universe hiccup,” “frayed threads,” “resounding hush”—and rhythm modulates with temple breath, achieving controlled liturgical cadence without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences double-load atmosphere and concept. Minor template cadence in “the witness… the witness…” repetitions, but loops never obscure causality or dull the exit image. Figurative language stays internally consistent—spiral, thread, hush—without mixed-metaphor clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mythic-library trope is refreshed by treating the dictionary as living arbitration engine and the witness as passive observer who must become active unifier. Risk lies in near-abstraction, yet the concretely handled prop and final cosmic reconfiguration prevent derivative drift; synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmick.</comment>
