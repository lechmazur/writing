<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s longing to repay a “debt across lifetimes” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a concrete on-page choice; she kneels, clutches, and “steps into the endless night,” yet none of these micro-moves carry a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses a path. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous connection”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat promises “freedom and reckoning,” but the story withholds what is actually risked or refused, so the arc lands as mood rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Charged Poise—the bead’s glow and the chorus of whispers reconfigure her solitary debt into a collective one—yet the cost is asserted, not shown: no option is visibly closed off, no price exacted on the page. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); the bead’s awakening simply “comes at a cost,” but the causal chain between clutching it and the new communal burden is implied, not dramatized. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the midpoint reflective block (≈30% of text) pauses present pressure, softening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The alchemical greenhouse is rendered with tactile specificity—“petrified blossoms,” “glass walls like a second skin,” “branches twisted like the arms of a mourner”—and filters every detail through the ghost’s bereaved attention. Temperature contrast (warm sanctuary vs. winter-cracked fields) externalizes her liminal state, while the single anchor tree functions as micro-setting that literally roots her haunting. The final image of bead-light illuminating her path uses the environment to charge the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—repay personal debt vs. collective sorrow—is signaled early, but escalation is lyric accumulation rather than tightening: each paragraph restates the same tension at similar intensity. The bead’s glow intensifies and the whispering chorus arrives, yet these events do not narrow her options or force a trade-off; she simply “steps into the endless night” with hope. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed, so pressure plateaus instead of peaking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: private grief becomes communal obligation through the bead’s resonance, suggesting that haunting is a shared, not solitary, condition. The refrain of “mournful elation” threads the piece without explicit moral, and the final image reweights the premise from personal release to collective reckoning. The insight is earned through imagistic accretion rather than statement, though the lack of on-page cost keeps the resonance one note short of full charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric hovers close to the ghost’s sensorium; diction (“ashen-veil,” “lovingly venomous”) remains consistent and motivated by spectral estrangement. Rhythm swells and contracts with long, breath-held clauses that mimic drifting, then shortens at the bead-glow climax, mirroring her lifted weight. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on the textured, bereaved cadence that sustains a single perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor is sustained (“branches twisted like the arms of a mourner”) rather than stacked, avoiding purple overload. Occasional abstraction (“resonant awakenings”) slightly dilutes density, but most sentences carry double duty—atmosphere plus interiority. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final third stays clean, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The ghost-bound-to-orchard trope is refreshed by treating the greenhouse as alchemical crucible rather than gothic backdrop, and the bead’s shift from personal key to collective beacon supplies a non-obvious reconfiguration. Specificity of “petrified blossoms” and “winter-cracked fields” prevents generic anywhere-haunting. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis over plot—but the imagistic payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
