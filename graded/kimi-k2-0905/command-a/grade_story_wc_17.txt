<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—she kneels, trembles, registers the ivy’s curl—yet the “legacy burden” remains abstract, never narrowing her choices until the final mirror beat. The micro-choice to press the wall is present, but the contradiction between obsessive mapping and sudden acceptance of “being their voice” isn’t dramatized; the cost is felt only in the closing lyric image, not in a prior beat where she might have rejected that role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror reweights her mission from mapping to remembrance, with the film strip and diaries acting as charged objects. Causality is accumulative rather than sharply reversed; the lens holds as lyrical density re-weights stakes. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~120 words. No teleporting props; each discovery (ivy passage→fireplace→mirror) is spatially tracked and动机-linked to her perceptual trait.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: the ivy, cracked wall, and blackened hearth are tactile and constrain movement. Humidity and moss narrow her sensory field under the Accumulative lens. The film strip’s physical handling (slipping, catching light) satisfies the 9+ gate. Climate-shift is mentioned but never affects tactics; still, the ivy’s “breathing” and the fireplace ash charge the closure image, so no cap applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early and tightens when the diaries warn “to listen is to lose oneself.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the mirror: knowledge that walls dream of being remembered narrows her future path to voice-bearing. Cost is conceptual (she abandons pure cartography) rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the cadence shift from discovery to stewardship satisfies escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of listening: from hearing ivy whispers to accepting responsibility as the walls’ voice. The final image of the passage “brighter, echoes softer” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the scholar’s vanished life and the unspoken implication that she too could vanish; the ambiguity is purposeful. No thematic echo line articulates the thesis, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices “faint hum of history” and ivy tendrils “like fingers.” Diction stays within her lexicon; no filter-verb clusters in peak beats. Rhythm modulates: shorter clauses under pressure (“She pressed… it gave way”). No dialogue, so voice distinction clause not triggered. Patterned elision (e.g., skipping chemical development) is taught early and paid off at the mirror.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is selective: “ivy… breathing with whispers” and “walls seemed to pulse” appear only at pressure beats, avoiding density overload. One scaffold lapse—“the walls seemed to close in, their dreams growing louder, more insistent” repeats the same verb cluster; −0.3. Otherwise sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No mixed metaphors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise—“mapping what walls dream”—offers a fresh angle on explorer/ghost-place trope. The film-negative-as-key and mirror-as-window are familiar devices but integrated through the scholar’s diaries, giving them specific weight. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulative structure rather than twist. Transformation test fails slightly: swap “walls” for “trees” and plot still functions, limiting upper band.</comment>
