<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s curiosity and guilt are sketched efficiently, but “orchestrated” micro-choices are missing; the investigation is told rather than shown under pressure, so contradictory impulses never clash in-scene. The climactic recalibration reads symbolic, yet causally abrupt—no visible cost paid on-page. Heir status remains ornamental; it never complicates tactics or risk. Hence the arc is present but not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: telescope re-pointing = a Resonant Reconfiguration that reprices the observatory’s purpose (CR). However, causality leading in is elliptical—Eleanor’s sudden access after hours and the director-tea recap feel off-stage. Orientation is fine; the first 120 words anchor. Still, the decisive act needs earlier planted obstruction for full cost-legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Brass, cloud-gap, and echoing glass are filtered through Eleanor’s journalistic gaze, supplying tactile specificity that steers attention. The misaligned telescope array mirrors internal dissonance without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (rosewood nib, journal) doubles as decision tool, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only minor drift: “dusty star charts” is generic amid otherwise sharp selects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prime stake—exposing clandestine surveillance—arrives early and tightens when Eleanor re-aims the telescope, foreclosing silent complicity. Pressure escalates through data accumulation rather than direct threat; the vanished journalist implies danger but stays off-page, muting visceral cost. One clear micro-turn satisfies lens, yet stakes never test her physically or socially in-scene, capping depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of redirected sight—cosmos vs. control—emerges through telescope imagery without explicit sermon. Final re-alignment offers Conceptual Repricing: science reclaimed from weaponization. Subtextual irony: observer becomes observed, but nuance would sharpen if Eleanor felt immediate exposure risk. Overall, resonance derives from concrete imagery rather than meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays stable in close-third; perceptual signature is precise—“newsprint heiress” notices misalignment instantly, aligning with trained eye. Prose rhythm modulates, turning staccato during discovery beats. Dialogue (with director) is brief, laced with veiled inquiry; voices remain distinct. Filter verbs minimal; voice never slips into editorial gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“orbits of regret”) skirts purple but stays anchored to theme. Information density strong; no scaffolding loops. A few conceptual repeats (“echoing”) are negligible and don’t dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Surveillance-observatory inversion is fresh, merging astronomical and political optics seamlessly. Heir-journalist angle adds social access uncommon in conspiracy tales. Familiar “misused science” backbone is re-skinned through starlight vs. streetlight metaphor, making the synthesis feel particular rather than derivative.</comment>
