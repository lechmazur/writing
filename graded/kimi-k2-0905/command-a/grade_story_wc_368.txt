<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s “quietly explosive” mind is shown only in generic interiority; the gift of feeling others’ stories is declared, never enacted through contradictory embodied reaction. His micro-choice—offering the wing—comes late and alters nothing on-page; the woman’s decision to speak is unmotivated by any visible pressure from him. No cost attaches to his new awareness; closure leaves him unchanged, so the arc is decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is present as Conceptual Repricing: “his journey was far from over” reweights the premise, but the cost is abstract, not felt. Causal chain is thin: because he owns the wing he sits, because sun hits he sees a thread, because thread glows he approaches; each link is coincidence rather than narrowing choice. Orientation beats anchor quickly; no lens ambiguity, yet escalation remains flat—no option is foreclosed, no price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating tea house, plateau, cloud-kissed beams, jasmine air—selective sensory triangulation grounds each beat. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: its shifting colors cast literal light that halts the room, constraining attention and enabling Kael’s approach. Props (tea cup, window) are handled, not listed; spatial choreography is clean. Final image reuses the wing’s muted iridescence to mirror the woman’s acceptance, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why stories magnetize—stays theoretical; no on-page test, narrowing, or tangible price. Pressure is situational: the woman’s grief is revealed, but Kael’s goal is neither advanced nor threatened by it; he listens, exits unchanged. Single micro-turn (wing on sill → patrons freeze) is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is therefore decorative; cost absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared illumination emerges through imagery (wing light, sun trails) rather than overt statement, avoiding Echo penalty. Subtext lingers in the silent exchange, but insight is generic: “we’re not alone.” Final reweighting is present yet mild—no new moral calculus, only affirmation. Ambiguity is coherent, but emotional aftereffect is thin because stakes never sharpen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is color-centric (indigo, saffron, amber, gold) consistent with dye-master vocation. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences calm, short pulses (“He could feel…”) cue gift activation. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interiority avoids filter verbs. Register stays literary but within plausible artisan lexicon; no mechanical cadence. Closure image keeps distance intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the air was thick with…”) repeats familiar tea-house trope. Metaphors remain coherent (sun painted trails), no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers scent, light, social cue. Final paragraph drifts into generic uplift phrasing, dulling last beat. Artifact-free in closure zone; keeps 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise—empathic dye-master on floating teahouse using butterfly wing to read story-magnetism—is fresh, yet execution drifts toward mystical tourism. Sun-trail method and donor heart are bright specifics, but neither shapes tactics; wing could swap with any shiny talisman. Emotional stakes recycle familiar grief-loss template without new angle. Risk is present but under-realized; originality is surface-level.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Observes twice, decides once (joins table); choice is polite, not tactical, and alters neither his nor her fate. Profession surfaces only as color-stained hands; no dyeing action or constraint. Setup present, middle development weak, closure cameo only → cap 4.6 lifted by specificity of gift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><grade>Handled in four distinct beats: cradled, placed on sill, colors stop room, taken away muted. Each touch advances scene and reweights meaning from beauty-warning to shared release. Closure linkage: its faded iridescence mirrors woman’s acceptance. Irreplaceable prop.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Concept stated once as “iridescent caution” but never constrains choice; wing’s fragility is shown, caution is told. No tactical shift flows from the warning. Serves as theme garnish, not tool.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mind labeled “explosive” yet manifests as calm observation; no volatile action or risk. Interior monologue stays serene, contradicting descriptor. Trait is label-only, unused.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Illumination action (wing-light spill) literally illuminates room and metaphorically prompts woman’s disclosure. Causes one social beat but does not redefine Kael’s options; mid-band utility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>“Tracking sun trails” is name-dropped as ancient method but never demonstrated; no on-page mechanics or failure. Swappable with “reading omens.” Late mention, no development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting supplies quiet sanctuary trope; slows time, enables conversation, but exerts zero external pressure or resource limit. Could be any serene venue. Micro-use: window light through wing is enabled by elevation, giving modest leverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Donor heart mentioned once to justify gift; creates no timeline urgency or physical limit. No ticking clock or stamina issue affects choices. Serves as origin garnish, not live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Desire stated in opening paragraph, re-stated in closure, but dramatized only through passive observation. Friction between want and cost is absent; he learns nothing that forecloses future paths. Mid development weak, closure participation nominal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder tone sustains throughout: hushed verbs, golden light, slow grace choreography. Modulates once when wing flash silences room, then returns to hush, supporting emotional crescendo. Coherent and charged final image.</comment>
