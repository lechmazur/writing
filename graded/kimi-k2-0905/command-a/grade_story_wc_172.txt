<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—profit-driven eco-criminal now risking all for one egg—but the amoral facet is asserted rather than enacted on-page; no beat shows her calculating self-interest clashing with sentiment. Embodied emotion is thin: “trembling hands” is generic, and the memory-flash of birdsong is summary, not sensory. The micro-choice to bury the egg is single and late; earlier walking/scanning is undifferentiated. Closure cost is conceptual (she might lose everything) but not dramatized or felt in body or resource.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rain starts the moment the egg is covered, reframing her lifetime of water theft into a seed of restitution; cost is legible as the rain that once made her rich now erodes her control. Causal chain is light—map cracks → damp spot → burial—but coherent under Situational lens; no reversals or tightening mid-text, only steady approach. Orientation is clean within 50 words. No lens ambiguity. Still, escalation is flat; the beat structure is arrival→placement→weather shift, so pressure never spikes before release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt flat is vividly textured—mirror crust, shifting surface, damp pocket revealed—and directly guides the final choice: only that patch can incubate the egg. Thunder lull supplies a temporal constraint that sharpens the moment. POV-filtered sensory hierarchy is strong (visual, haptic, auditory). Micro-setting (egg, cloak, boots) interacts with terrain at every step. No contradiction or spatial drift. Environment does not merely backdrop but enables the closure image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem extinction she helped cause—is signaled early and re-asserted at burial. Yet pressure is static: no obstacle, ticking clock, or internal counter-move complicates the walk; the only “tightening” is finding the damp spot, which is luck, not agency-driven escalation. Cost is projected (future exposure) rather than lived on-page. No option is foreclosed during the scene; thus escalation remains conceptual, satisfying basic but not high-band standards.</comment>

<comment>Theme of restorative fracture emerges through image pattern (cracked earth / cracked conscience) without explicit statement. Subtext is strongest in the ironic rain—her engineered drought now reversed by weather she cannot invoice. Sentimentality is confessed but not explored in scene, blunting complexity. Final image reframes prior water-theft empire, supplying resonant reconfiguration rather than moral, satisfying the 9+ test for resonance albeit with minor sentimentality residue.</comment>

<comment>Third-person free-indirect stays tightly latched to Elara’s diction: “clandestine means,” “profits had been immense” mirror her board-room idiom. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences early, shorter clauses under rain—without drumbeat. No head-hopping or filter bloat. Perceptual signature is consistent (capitalist metrics overlaid on landscape). Voice is serviceable, not yet unforgettable; no risky compression or patterned elision, so ceiling mid-7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; figurative language is selective (“earth shimmered like a cracked mirror”) and physically coherent. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Occasional template cadence (“She had…, She wore…, She followed…”) opens three sentences in paragraph 2—minor scaffold, not closure-touching. Hedging is minimal. Strong noun/verb choices (“billowed,” “clutched,” “shimmered”). Meets high-band baseline for line-level control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines eco-villain redemption with de-extinction in a salt-cathedral setting—fresh synthesis, not trope recycling. The “map of cracks” conceit turns environmental scar into navigational tool, an inventive reversal. Emotional arc is familiar (guilty magnate seeks absolution), but particulars keep it from generic transplant test. No bold structural risk; execution competent rather than startling. Slight freshness bonus withheld for safe linearity, yet concept earns above-median originality.</comment>
