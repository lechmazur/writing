<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers weaving star-threads while the flame pulses in counter-rhythm—but the moment she faces Lira her contradictory impulses are told (“Elara’s mind raced”) rather than embodied. The dagger-at-boot reflex is a nice micro-choice, yet the later decision to “synchronize” is asserted, not dramatized through visible cost. Mentor-loss trauma is invoked as backstory label, not lived scar. Closure earns partial credit: she foregoes sleep/safety to finish the chart, but the cost is implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: flame pulses → chart shifts → Lira arrives → they synchronize → dawn chart finished. Orientation anchored by 120 words (dome, cushion, eternal candle). Closure is Conceptual Repricing—chart path reweights the coup from political to cosmic—but the cost is conceptual, not visceral; no constraint or price lingers in the final image. Mentor-vanish info is withheld beyond Elara’s knowledge, so no retro-omniscience break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cobalt glass dome, velvet cushion, silver-gold threads, eternal candle flame—each returns to constrain action: dome reflects twilight so Elara sees approaching Lira; flame anchors the gateway; threads become the map that reweights stakes. Autumn wind is sensory but doesn’t affect choices; still, the observatory’s micro-objects function as setting. Spatial choreography clean: door, window, cushion, candle stay tracked. Final image recharges the dome at dawn, now reframed as cosmic crossroads. Meets 9+ gate: observatory tools charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the flame alight to preserve cosmic listening—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: Lira’s arrival narrows options from “wait” to “synchronize tonight.” No second reversal, but the single tightening is meaningful: dawn deadline forces all-night embroidery. Cost is conceptual (observatory as gateway secured) rather than visceral; hence caps below 8.8. Agency is Elara’s decision to stitch the new path, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as subversive act against councils that prefer silence. Stars’ unheard stories vs. political silencing gives resonance without moralizing. Final image—completed chart reframed as weapon—reconfigures embroidery from art to insurgency. No character verbalizes the thesis; “unheard stories” phrase appears once, early, and is left to reverberate. Ambiguity persists: victory may be temporary, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“galaxy-chart embroiderer,” “adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”—creates distinct speculative register without purple drift. Syntax mirrors textile rhythm: layered clauses mimic stitch-by-stitch attention. Flame’s pulsing and thread-shine carry subtext in place of dialogue. Minor slip: “synchronize” used as verb three times in four sentences mid-scene, creating template cadence; does not obscure clarity but prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; sentences carry dual duty (description + pressure). No paraphrase loops; “echoed silence” recurs with purpose. Metaphors stay coherent: flame as anchor, threads as star-paths. One mixed metaphor—“conspiracies were like knots in the cosmic thread”—reads slightly pat but does not tangle closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-anchor voice effectively. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she wondered”) they reflect genuine uncertainty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of textile craft with astrophysical insurgency feels fresh; trope of “mystical observatory” is retooled via embroidery-as-code. “Adjacent possibilities” and “eternal flame” risk cliché but are grounded in tactile stitching beats. Risk taken: cosmic embroidery as insurgent tech; payoff is coherent. Transformation test passes—swap embroidery for any other art and the stake collapses. No close echoes to famous scenes.</comment>
