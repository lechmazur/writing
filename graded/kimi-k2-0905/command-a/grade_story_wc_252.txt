<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—“guarded heart she couldn’t name”—rather than dramatized contradiction. The scrimshaw triggers action, yet her decision to row out feels more dream-logic than earned renunciation; no micro-choice visibly forfeits an earthly stake. Dock-worker grace is asserted, not weaponized under pressure. Closure lands as mood, not visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is loose: whale-call → island appears → barrier dissolves when scrimshaw is dropped. The treaty ban on violence is mentioned but never tests or constrains tactics, so the world-rule feels ornamental. Closure is Charged Poise (image of fading island) and carries lyric cost, yet the lens shifts from causal to accumulative without teaching the pattern early. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is vividly filtered through Elara’s labor-hardened body; sand, silt, and emerald shafts are tactile and bias-driven. The disappearing island’s spatial logic is intentionally dreamlike but tracked cleanly: shore appears, heart pulses, island recedes. Scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, capping entry to 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stake—“find freedom in embracing true nature”—stays abstract; no external obstacle or forfeiture sharpens it. Pressure escalates only atmospherically: whale call grows louder, island rises, but Elara’s options never narrow, nor does she risk anything tangible. Dropping the scrimshaw is symbolic surrender, not a trade-off that costs her later moves. Coincidence (island surfaces) legs the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges through aquatic imagery rather than thesis statement. Whale song and fading island reweight the idea of fluid identity without moralizing. Abstract phrasing (“freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was”) edges toward Echo in last paragraph, but sentence is brief and image-led. Subtextual enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains salt-stung diction and rhythmic control: “ocean’s breath whispered secrets.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices weight, glint, tide, not tourist vistas. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs minimal; syntax flexes with emotional swell. Voice sustains pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; no scaffolding or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors (“whale’s tail curled around a heart”) are physically impossible yet feel dream-legible, so waived. Final paragraph drifts toward template cadence: “freedom was found not in escape…” subtracts immediacy. Otherwise ear-test clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Subtly reverses the “magic object grants power” trope: scrimshaw works only when relinquished. Disappearing-island motif is familiar, but its linkage to self-unlocking feels fresh. Dock-worker grace fused with oceanic myth is specific enough to avoid generic template. Risk level moderate; no bold structural gamble, but synthesis is non-obvious.</comment>
