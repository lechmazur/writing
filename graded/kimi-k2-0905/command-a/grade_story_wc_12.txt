<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The priest’s motivation—“illuminate hidden assumptions”—is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice shows why THIS moment matters to HIM. Interiority stays generic (“he knew,” “he felt”) and never embodies fear, doubt, or cost. The palette/black void is handled ritualistically, never altering tactics on the page; thus the final declaration arrives unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence and rhetorical questions layer density until a conceptual re-pricing (“the unraveled stillness is clarity”) dissolves the possession. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; however, the text never converts static ritual into a tightening beat that forecloses an option. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is purely abstract—no visible price is paid by the priest, so the effect feels observational rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is rendered through selective, sensory silence—sound as presence—which stays coherent and thematic. Spatial choreography is fuzzy (walls “shifting” but no anchors for scale or movement) and the palette’s void lacks tactile handling. Still, the silence-as-setting constrains the priest’s only tool (questions) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic possession—is declared early. Pressure accumulates via repeated questions, but each beat restates the same abstract threat without narrowing options or raising personal cost; escalation is tonal, not tactical. The climax is a declaration, not a decision that forecloses a path; therefore agency remains atmospheric rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—unquestioned assumptions feed metaphysical consumption—emerges cleanly through the silence-as-assault device. Subtext operates in the void-palette, reweighted at the end. The final line offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. However, the absence of lived, particularized stakes keeps the resonance slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a consistent ecclesiastical cadence; diction stays within the priest’s cosmological lexicon. Compression (“decorates with silence”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm modulates with paragraph breaths, supporting the accumulative lens without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong auditory and void imagery, but recurrent abstract nouns (“assumptions,” “existence,” “truth”) create template cadence that dulls immediacy. Metaphors stay coherent yet stacked in places (“void given form,” “canvas waiting”). No paraphrase loops, but filter-verb clusters (“he began to,” “he continued to”) soften propulsion. Closure line is clean; earlier scaffolding keeps it from 7+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silence-as-material and rhetoric-as-weapon synthesize into a fresh metaphysical vignette. The risk—cosmic stakes with a single, static figure—mostly pays off through concept-driven resonance. The absence of individualized human detail keeps it from full memorability; still, the angle is non-obvious and executed without gimmickry.</comment>
