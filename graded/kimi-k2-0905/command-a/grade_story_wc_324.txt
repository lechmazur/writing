<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembled,” “breath catching”), but her “curiosity” is asserted more than dramatized in contradiction; the final nod of acceptance is credible yet the cost feels abstract rather than corporeal. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible unused; micro-choices (picking up aid, pressing it to ear, nodding) are present but don’t foreclose a path with felt bodily price. Motivation to “protect vulnerable voices” is declared; it guides action but never collides with a counter-incentive that would sharpen flaw or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hearing-aid pulse → breadcrumb search → photograph → charge to protect. Closure lands as Charged Poise: photograph warms, hush follows her out; conceptual cost (“even the smallest voices were heard”) is legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no disorientation taught for later payoff, but also no penalty. Single scene, default scope met; one micro-turn (pulse clarifies from faint to urgent) tightens rather than reverses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mist, twilight, and atrium are filtered through Elara’s bodily progress; pulses and crevice-handling make the space tactile. The hearing-aid itself acts as micro-setting that constrains every routing choice; its final silence cues the exit. Sensory selection favors haptics and sound; no visual catalog. Final image of warm photograph in satchel reweights the atrium as sanctuary, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“protect this voice”—is signaled early; escalation is accumulative: each pulse thickens atmosphere rather than narrows tactical options. Agency is observational (follow, study, slip into satchel) rather than decisional; no live option is foreclosed. Cost is atmospheric, not tangible; price never alters her physical ability or future path. Tightening deepens mood but does not test commitment or risk loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of unheard voices emerges through found object and photograph rather than statement; subtext resides in silence, sepia edges, and “reeling hush.” Final image reprises sanctuary idea, answering the implied question “who listens?” without moralizing. Some abstract phrasing (“chaos of life,” “world that often forgot to listen”) edges toward generality. Complexity is present but muted by lack of competing moral claims.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Elara; perceptual signature filters through professional tracer lens (“faint pulses,” “breadcrumb”). Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with strategic breath-length variation. No dialogue to test naturalism; diction remains within plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or distance drift; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, looping largely avoided, but several soft adjective stacks (“mist-clad atrium,” “reeling hush”) recur without pattern payoff; “reeling” remains unclear in sensory terms. One paraphrase loop: “her curiosity drove her forward, even as…” restates prior impulse. Strong verbs (“clinging,” “swirled”) and varied sentence openers keep momentum. No grammar slips; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh metaphor though here it collapses into conventional ghost-medium beat; occupational detail does not differentiate process. Photograph-as-echo device is familiar but saved by specificity of sepia, frayed edges, and atrium match. Risk level is moderate; concept entertains but does not reconfigure genre assumptions. Specificity of pulses via antique hearing aid supplies memorable inflection.</comment>
