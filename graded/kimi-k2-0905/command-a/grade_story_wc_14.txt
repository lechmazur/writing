<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority stays at a polite distance; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the “earnest, studious” label never collides with a visible flaw or cost. The final beat—tucking the notepad away—records rather than enacts a choice, leaving the arc a flat accumulation instead of a charged renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the forest “whispers approval” and Elara descends with the new history inside the satchel; the cost is conceptual (she now carries an unshareable burden) and is legible. Causality is thin—why tonight’s hum spikes is unexplained—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern holds, but the tightening beat is external (the hum coalesces) rather than a decision she forces.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth is evoked with tactile economy—moss underfoot, rustling approval—and the fluorescent lamp’s flicker becomes a micro-setting that guides her timing. Spatial choreography stays clean; the forest never blocks or aids her in a way that alters tactics, so the setting enriches texture more than it constrains choice, keeping the score just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—preserve invented histories—but no alternative path is risked or forfeited; pressure escalates only in intensity of the hum, not in narrowed options. The peak moment is reception, not action, so agency is observational; cost is atmospheric rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens but staying modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as private, living texture—emerges through the synesthetic act of “refracting” sound into story, avoiding overt statement. The final image of her descending while the town awakens reweights solitude as the price of insight, but the lack of an internal counter-argument keeps resonance one-note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction tilts slightly archaic (“gilded-leaf stationer,” “incandescent restraint”) yet stays internally consistent, giving the prose a lapidary texture that matches the miniature-forest aesthetic. No dialogue means voice is judged on narrative texture alone, which remains controlled and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective and rarely stacked. Occasional filter phrases (“seemed to amplify,” “felt different”) slightly dull immediacy, but no loops or mixed metaphors obscure the closing image. Clean copy; one paraphrase loop (“histories that only she could decipher… histories that lingered”) earns a −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “listening to fluorescent hum to distill lost timelines” is fresh, and the bonsai-labyrinth locale particularizes it. Risk is quiet—no structural gimmicks—but the synthesis of miniature trees and archival mysticism feels inevitable rather than ornamental, landing north of mid-band.</comment>
