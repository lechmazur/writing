<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s serene-decisive kindness is asserted but never tripped by contradiction; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible price, so the trait feels like a label rather than a lived tension. Interiority floats in generic therapy-speak (“her heart full”) instead of embodied, character-specific sensation. Micro-choices—calling Claire, picking the vinyl—are smooth but uncontested, so no value hierarchy is forced. Closure is gentle but costless; the goodbye succeeds exactly as planned, so nothing is foreclosed and the character arc is flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear and linear: blood-work clock → Elara summons Claire → reconciliation → deathbed closure. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the Orientation Test is satisfied. The closure beat lands a Decisive Change (mother-daughter reunion) with soft emotional cost, not protagonist cost; the lens is Causal and holds. One tightening turn suffices at this length; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Radiant haven above the clouds” is sketched with lavender-eucalyptus scent and soft glow, but remains a postcard backdrop; it neither obstructs nor enables any choice. Micro-setting objects—vinyl fragment, harp, photograph—do receive tactile attention and the vinyl refracts light at the final image, giving a modest charge. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. World rules are consistent but thin; no constraint shapes tactics, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and achieved without friction; escalation is therefore static. Claire’s arrival tightens the room emotionally but does not test Elara’s agency or force a trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Protagonist faces zero adaptation; the plan works on first try, so pressure plateaus rather than rises. Cost is off-loaded onto the dying woman and estranged daughter; Elara’s own stakes remain risk-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of “broken things can still sing” emerges through the vinyl fragment and the reconciled pair, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext is modest: the unspoken apology passes in silence while Elara plays, a nice indirection. No motif checklist; the scent of hope stays atmospheric rather than recursive. Ending image (vinyl catching light) offers quiet repricing, but because Elara is unchanged the resonance is muted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature is pleasant but generic—“soft, eternal glow,” “delicate blend”—lacking idiosyncratic sensorium of a musician. Rhythm is smooth, sentences varied; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is sparse yet natural when present; Claire’s single line reads credibly. Voice does not scale under pressure because no pressure is allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, readable, free of loops or near-duplicates; metaphors are simple and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“hymning the mundane,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authorial rather than Elara’s. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. No artifacts touch the closure beat; the final line is crisp and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Premise—cloud hospice where music therapists repair goodbyes—is fresh, but execution drifts toward familiar feel-good template: estranged child summoned, deathbed hugs, broken object metaphor. Vinyl fragment is the single specific inflection that keeps the story from full cliché. No bold structural or perspectival risk is taken. Transformation test: swapping Elara for any gentle healer would not change beats, indicating insufficient inextricability.</comment>
