<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “confidently uncertain” paradox is lived in the moment of writing on void-air; the pen warms in her palm, forcing a visible micro-choice. Interiority stays sensorial (“vibrated through her bones”) rather than diagnostic. The final renunciation—pen cold, anomaly reduced to ripple—carries cost, but her flaws (curiosity, hubris) are sketched more than probed; still, the beat-to-beat linkage is clean.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is intact: anomaly → summons → void entry → pen activation → timeline restitch. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky is only “a mere ripple,” a visual cost paid for her invisible inscription. The lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt. One minor wobble: we never learn why Elara can write in vacuum—rule shift isn’t cued, but it arrives at the climax and the image still reweights stakes, so the flaw is hairline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is more light show than constraint—no spatial or tactical friction beyond “float.” Yet the pen-as-micro-setting fills the gap: its warming nib and inkless flow literally enable the final inscription, tethering the closure image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“crunched on cracked earth”). For 9+ gate, I need environment to shape tactics; here the anomaly allows rather than limits, so capped just below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“uncover the truth, no matter how unsettling”—is declared early. Escalation is single but sufficient: the void forces her to choose between recording and repairing; the pen’s warmth signals rising cost. Price is visible in the final image: anomaly shrinks, pen dies, implying irreversible edit. No secondary reversal, yet the causal narrowing satisfies 8+ threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “history is healed not by erasure but by adjusted relationships”—shown when her airy calligraphy re-knits farmer-historian-Elara triad. No explicit thesis; final ripple image performs the repricing. The idea is coherent, if familiar; specificity of the pen and seeds keeps it from generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory pipe; no head-hop. Diction skews lyrical—“time folded like a crumpled sheet”—but remains consistent with a celestial interpreter’s idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for drift inside void, crisp fragments upon exit. One elevated phrase (“conceptual repricing” type diction) sneaks in narrative summary, yet it’s brief and doesn’t rupture voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, few filter verbs. One metaphor run in the void paragraph (“sea of light and shadow… kaleidoscope of possibility”) risks purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No scaffold loops; sentences vary. Minor simultaneity glitch: “She raised it, feeling the weight…” implies two beats at once, but clarity survives. Keeps propulsion and earns its density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: inkless pen as quantum stylus grafts onto agrarian-seed anomaly; timeline editing via relationship-not-destruction angle refreshes stale time-travel trope. Specificity of “exotic nib carved from unknown material” grounds the concept. Risk is moderate but coherent. Not earth-shattering, yet feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
