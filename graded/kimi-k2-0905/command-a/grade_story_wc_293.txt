<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bridge-Song’s curiosity is clear, but interiority stays generic—“luminous disbelief,” “renewed determination”—without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values; the fiddle is lifted once, passively. The ending gesture (raise fiddle, play) is unmotivated by any fresh cost or loss, so the arc feels like label-only growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass flake becomes a gateway map and “pixelated amnesty” a literal sanctuary, reweighting the premise. Causality is loose—scaffold-wrap method appears only at the final beat, not tested earlier—so the reconfiguration is clever but not earned by prior tactics. Still, the before/after is legible under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout and clearing are sketched with selective sensory strokes—golden light, cool breeze, overgrown structure—filtered through the fiddler’s attention. Spatial choreography stays clean; the glass flake’s shifting images tether description to action. Environment never actively constrains choice (no weather, altitude, or tool failure), so the setting decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Single stake: decode the flake and find what the hitchhiker sought. Pressure escalates only by walking farther; no narrowing options, resource loss, or external obstacle raises cost. The final “sanctuary” reveal is a lucky match, not a tightening trade-off, so escalation remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of rewriting fate through pattern-seeing emerges implicitly from the glass flake and scaffold-wrap reveal. Final image of music echoing through mountains offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing, but the concept stays intellectual because the protagonist pays no tangible price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Bridge-Song’s perceptual filter—sound, light, texture—without head-hop. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “pixelated” and “scaffold wrap” to teach pattern. Diction edges toward poetic abstraction but remains coherent; no dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) risks overwriting but fits the lyric mode and does not blur causality. Metaphors stay consistent; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing wet-plate collodion with pixelated amnesty is a fresh techno-analog hybrid; scaffold-wrap cartography feels novel. The hitchhiker-vanishes trope is familiar, but the flake-as-map and sanctuary twist transform it. Specificity of the fiddler’s sensory lens keeps the concept from reading as gimmick.</comment>
