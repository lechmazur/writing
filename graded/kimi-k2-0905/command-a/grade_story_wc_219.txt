<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “luminous skeptic” tag is asserted, not dramatized; her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“the chemistry of homecoming…was not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt”). The moment of softening awe lands, but the causal bridge is abbreviated; we see the shift declared rather than felt in body or choice. Cost is present (she leaves her amber, completing the circuit) yet scaled to lyric closure, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber pieces, tower layers, and converging footprints build density toward the charged merger at the pedestal. Orientation is clean by word 80; no causality breaks. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—map inside amber re-weights “homecoming” with conceptual cost—though the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Tower, path, and amber function as micro-settings that physically constrain ascent and final placement; rain-glazed stone and wet-earth scent are filtered through Elara’s academic gaze. Spatial choreography is exact—footprints deepen, ledge meeting is mid-ascent, summit chamber centered—no floating white-room. Spring decay/renewal paradox mirrors theme without overt symbolism; the environment is tactile, lived-in, and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early; pressure accrues texturally as each artifact (dusty prints, stranger’s amber, tower glyphs) narrows interpretation toward surrender rather than analytical mastery. Single meaningful deepening at the pedestal reweights knowledge: homecoming is experiential, not extractable. Felt cost is conceptual (loss of explanatory certainty) not visceral, capping escalation at 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively from repeated convergence imagery; no final-paragraph thesis. The amber’s shift from specimen to sacrament reprises with new weight, achieving resonance without moral. Subtext lives in silent pilgrim exchange and tactile object handling. Ambiguity remains—tower is both sacred and artificial—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains consistent perceptual signature: skeptical scientist noticing mineral sheen, scent molecules, inscription syntax. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for ascent compression, clipped fragments at pedestal reveal. No head-hop; lyric elisions (“bronze quiet”) are seeded early and repay off in hush of final merger. Voice stays within POV lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; only minor scaffold (“the tower, once…now…”) and one near-paraphrase loop (“shared curiosity and longing” vs “shared purpose”). Metaphors stay coherent (rainwashed stone, circuit of light). No artifact touches closure. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Register holds; slight poetic lift acceptable for speculative lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-contact “artificial pilgrimage” trope is familiar, but anchoring it in geoscientist POV and amber-driven map offers fresh inflection. Convergence via dusty footprints rather than cosmic signal is pleasantly grounded. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but payoff lands. Could swap tower for any relic site, so not fully irreplaceable, yet synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
