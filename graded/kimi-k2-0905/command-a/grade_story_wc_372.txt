<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s gently meticulous nature is shown through tactile care (gloved hands, velvet casing) and later weaponized when urgency collides with habit; the inscription’s shift reweights her task from routine to legacy, earning a renunciation of pure order. Interior contradiction is light—no moment of genuine self-doubt on the page—so the arc feels singular rather than wrestled. Still, the embodied trait directly enables the closure image (steady hands carrying light), meeting the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transformed slide’s new inscription and lantern-bridge reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—oblivion deferred, duty enlarged. Causal chain is lean but intact: noticing anomaly → lantern activation → library tremor → altered vow → new purpose. One soft spot: the lantern-triggered tremor is accepted without事前 rule-teaching, but the accumulative lens holds. Cost is legible in the final line: “her heart alight,” a price of perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline shelves, quartz hush, and frost-bitten air are woven through action (breath mist, refracted prisms) and directly shape the lantern’s fragility; the cold justifies gloves, pace, and reverence. Micro-setting—the velvet casing and the measuring device—constrains every touch. Final image of lantern-light bridging abyss is charged by the frozen void it crosses. No orientation drift; anchor clear at line 6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning before oblivion—signaled early; pressure tightens when the anomalous slide forces a choice: preserve protocol or step into the call. The tremor is the one visible escalation; afterward the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, fitting the accumulative lens. No second reversal, but the slide’s rewrite forecloses neutrality—she is now “the one who carries.” Felt price is the open-ended guardianship she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transitive stewardship emerges through the slide’s mutable inscription rather than assertion; the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer—light carried forward instead of hoarded. No moralizing, only image. Particulars (orderly ritual, lantern inversion) reweight abstraction into lived duty. Subtext of succession is implied in the shift from “could not” to “carry,” giving the reader interpretive space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains a hushed, crystalline register that mirrors the quartz hush tone; syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly archaic (“gently meticulous care”) without purple drift. Perceptual signature is curator-cold: noticing frequencies, velvet, frost, light angles—never warmth. No dialogue to test, but interior diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Compression is purposeful; elision taught early (“silence hung like a quartz hush”) and held to final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, or conceptual information without scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows”) and tied to world logic. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reverence, clipped fragments for tremor. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-library and memory-lantern slides feel fresh, yet the “message from predecessor” beat is recognizable; specificity of frequency-sampling device and vow-rewriting inscription tilts it toward transformation. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist. Emotional specificity (orderly vs. eternal custodian) personalizes the trope. Could not reach 8.5 because the core slide-message concept is familiar even if dressing is novel.</comment>
