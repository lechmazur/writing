<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The poet’s interiority is lyrically specific—“a tremor of certainty ripple through them”—but we never learn why art must transcend, what boundary cost they personally face, or what forfeiture occurs when the ice re-freeze leaves them “breathless.” The arc is one-note awe; no contradictory impulse complicates the choice to recite, so the change feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Ambient causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image layers density until the ice shards float upward as a cadence shift. Yet the closure beat—“they had become a part of its song”—states rather than dramatizes cost; no option is foreclosed, no price is legible on the page, so the Resonant Reconfiguration remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Cobalt atrium,” “humming quartz,” and ice shards suspended “as if held by invisible hands” are vivid, sensory, and thematically integral. The frozen lake micro-setting re-sets physical possibility, allowing the levitation image that charges closure; however, the atrium’s internal layout stays vague, keeping the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—permission to transcend artistic boundaries—is signaled early but never materially tested; no external resistance or internal fear complicates the recital. The single escalation is the ice cracking upward, a beautiful Accumulative intensification, yet it imposes no tactical cost or narrowing of options for the poet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Theme of sacred-versus-crossable boundaries emerges through the colonnade’s song and the final image of rewritten ice, avoiding explicit moral. The refrain of “tremor of certainty” risks thematic-label echo, but the motif is reweighted when the poet’s identity dissolves into the lake’s melody, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>A sustained lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance; diction like “lantern-moth hush” and syntax of cascading prepositional phrases create a textured, atmospheric voice that modulates into quieter farewell. Perceptual signature is consistent—twilight skin-clinging anticipation—without filter-verb drift; only minor cadence loops (“the poet… the poet…”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences layer metaphor upon metaphor, but each adds a new sensory angle rather than restating, achieving high density. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long clauses build, then short fragments mirror ice shards. Occasional elevated register (“atrium,” “paraphrase”) fits the aesthete POV, so no register drift penalty, yet metaphor abundance nudges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Combining lyric prose with speculative architecture—quartz colonnade that rewrites reality by poetic recitation—feels fresh, but the core arc (artist meets magical conduit, transcends) flirts with familiar template. Specificity of “lantern-moth hush” and floating ice shards transforms the trope enough to feel particular, though not startlingly non-obvious.</comment>
