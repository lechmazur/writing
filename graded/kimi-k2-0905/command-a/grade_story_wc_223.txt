<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—“she too had lived in that shadow”—and her desire to archive small gestures is dramatized when she fingers the pawn-less board and later joins the word-walk. The revelation that her acting was both empathy and evasion lands as credible micro-epiphany, but the beat is compressed into a single clause; we see little contradictory impulse in scene, so the change feels more stated than lived. Kael’s benevolent ruthlessness stays mostly rhetorical; no action shows the ruthless edge, so status tension never sharpens. Overall, enough embodied specificity to clear the 7-band, but not the visceral cost or flaw-driven mistake that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the gallery’s echoes, the absent pawns, and the word-path layer density until “forgiveness” and “belonging” re-weight Elara’s self-concept. The closure is a Charged Poise: the whispers modulate from past-echo to future-promise while Elara stands in “luminous absence,” a felt reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who/where/when inside 120 w), the single shard holds, and the cost—her acknowledgement of avoided pain—is legible. One minor drag: the chessboard’s agency is asserted more than exercised, so the symbolic constraint doesn’t tighten tactics; still, the pattern holds and the resonance lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is sketched through acoustic immediacy—“echoes linger… weight of forgotten conversations”—and the floor-pattern walk turns setting into active grammar. Sensory economy is POV-tilted: Elara notices tactile grooves, not frescoes, fitting her haptic historian bent. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the board and etched floor without drift. The board itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-use, but broader environmental constraint on choice remains light, capping at 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Elara keep collecting others’ pain as shield or confess her own? Pressure accumulates through iterative listening/walking rather than causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens. Middle turn is the joint spelling of “forgiveness”—first time she authors, not archives, a gesture—narrowing her future stance. Cost is present (she forecloses the safety of detached performance), yet not viscerally paid on page (no lost relationship, physical toll, or public exposure), so escalation feels moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—history of overlooked gestures—emerges through the board’s missing pawns and the word-path’s foot-written lexicon, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext is carried in silence: Kael’s faint smile and Elara’s fingertip on empty square speak louder than exposition. Final “luminous absence” reweights absence from lack to aperture, a non-literal resonance. No late moralizing, though the penultimate line nudges toward summarizing the insight; still, the idea stays embedded in concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays close to Elara with perceptual diction—“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”—that feels like her crisis-actor vocabulary. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for gallery hush, clipped fragment when Kael says, “A game without pawns.” Dialogue is spare but carries subtext; Kael’s invitation to walk is simultaneously test and gift. No head-hopping; focalization stable. Minor lapse: “benevolently ruthless” sounds authorial rather than Kael’s self-label; a brief register lift, not pervasive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, no scaffold loops; sentences layer image and idea efficiently. Figurative control high: “echoes… weight of forgotten conversations” is concrete metaphor that pays off in final whisper shift. No mixed metaphors or purple clusters. One filter-verb patch in opening—“She felt a kinship”—but quickly moves to tactile action. Final paragraph’s repetition of “small gesture” is purposeful callback, not template cadence. Clean copy, strong paragraph rhythm, read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The pawn-less chessboard as future-building metaphor is fresh twist on familiar interregnum trope. Word-walking floor pattern re-channels lang-scape art installations into intimate stakes. Crisis-actor becoming historian of micro-gestures offers occupational specificity rarely seen. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative, though concept leans cerebral; emotional risk could be sharper. Sufficient novelty and specificity to clear 7-band, short of the jolt needed for 8.8+.</comment>
