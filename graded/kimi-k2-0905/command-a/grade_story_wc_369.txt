<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet custodian persona is consistent, but interiority stays safely general (“felt a pull,” “smiled”) rather than exposing contradiction under pressure; micro-choices (handling sextant, descending) exist yet never force a visible trade-off or cost, so the ending’s beatitude feels assumed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight → sextant mending → dream coalescence deepens the same stake each beat. Closure achieves a Charged Poise in the final paragraph, but the cost is only asserted (“burden lifted”), not dramatized on Elias, capping the reconfiguration’s punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Storm-lit tower, cracked window, moonlit brass shards—each sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s custodial eye and guides tactile action; the mending sextant literally reconfigures the maze’s atmosphere, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9-band candidacy even at compressed length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map sorrow to wholeness”—is clear; pressure escalates as each sextant shard reveals quantified grief, but Elias remains observer/technician rather than agent whose choice narrows; thus the tightening is textural, not consequential, and the price stays diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sorrow→healing via moonlight motif emerges through recurring images (child’s tree, lover’s farewell) and lands as a Conceptual Repricing: labyrinth as sanctuary for communal grief. The answer to “what trees witness” is shown, not sermonized, though sentiment edges toward neatness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with clean psychic distance; perceptual signature (“tool belt,” “dusty table,” corridor acoustics) is quietly vocational. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for awe, clipped fragments for discovery—without overwriting; no POV leaks or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty (description + stake), variation keeps momentum; occasional poetic uplift (“repository of scattered dreams”) risks mild purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; grammar clean; final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dream-mapping custodian + moon-healing sextant offers fresh angle on “maintenance of memory” trope; sorrow quantified by broken instrument feels novel. The climax’s transcendence is foreseeable once moonlight mending is introduced, muting surprise, but synthesis remains idiosyncratic and earned.</comment>
