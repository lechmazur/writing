<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s rational truffle-hunter persona is cleanly embodied in sensory, soil-level action; his “quiet smile” finish shows micro-change with cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the single forced-truth beat (“I don’t want to keep this…”) is slightly under-cooked—no contradictory impulse in scene, just surprise—so the flaw complicating later choice is told more than dramatized. Psychological-safety motive stays visible, drives every beat, and the renunciation lands as credible endurance with felt relief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: trowel hits eye → truth leak → village consultation → dawn ritual → reburial; each beat narrows options under Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): orchard exhales, Elias smiles, cost visible in the relinquished control. One soft spot: the textbook ritual is introduced late and accepted without pushback, so the final beat’s causal weight is more borrowed than earned, nudging down from 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hanging orchard is evoked with selective, truffle-scented detail—twisted branches, damp air, storm-scarred bark—and the glass eye’s micro-setting (soil, sunbeam, color shift) constrains the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clean across ravine ascent and village; weather mirror (predawn calm vs. earlier storms) subtly reweights the final grace. No orientation debt; environment charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are personal/psychic safety vs. relic contamination; pressure tightens once when truth blurts, again when ritual cost (loss of control) is accepted. Escalation is single but meaningful: the eye’s warmth/cold shift literalizes the narrowing. No credible external antagonist, yet the orchard itself becomes pressure vessel; cost is the surrender of absolute rational control, legible in final smile. Agency stays active—Elias decides to seek, to recite, to re-bury—so causal agency holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen vs. forced truth emerges through soil and eye, not sermon. Final smile lets “fractured grace” reweight earlier storm imagery: safety is acceptance of cracks, not erasure. Subtext operates in sensory cues (temperature shift, scent); no final moral stated. Minor slack: late-cue ritual could have carried stronger ironic echo of discredited science, but ambiguity still invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, filtering every notice through truffle-hunter priorities (scent, soil, humidity). Diction stays earthy and spare; only one filter-verb cluster (“seemed to”) around eye vision, forgiven by POV uncertainty. No head-hop; Mara’s brief dialogue carries distinct tremor without stealing interior focus. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under shock, longer cadence at dawn—supporting pressure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (move, evoke, reveal). Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Loop check clean: no synonym churn or template cadence; scaffold-free. One paraphrase ripple (“fractured grace” echoed twice in closing paragraph) is purposeful reprise, not redundancy. Opening and final lines anchor and release with image economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-empathy-virus orchard + truth-forcing relic is fresh synthesis; truffle-forager protagonist is off-beat occupational lens rarely seen. Ritual via discredited textbook feels lightly borrowed from “forgotten tongues” trope, but soil-level specificity keeps it from cliché. Emotional insight—safety equals selective occlusion—offers non-obvious wisdom. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent but not jaw-dropping, holding sub-8.8 ceiling.</comment>
