<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and scent-bound, but Elias’s contradictory impulses stay summary-level; the vial makes him act, yet the moment he uncorks it is under-dramatized, so the earned cost feels reported rather than embodied. Micro-choices (touching, hesitating, uncorking) are present, but none carry a visible trade-off that forecloses a live option; grief is accepted, not chosen against a competing path. The sister-memory scenes are evocative, yet they function as exposition rather than crucible pressure on him now. Still, the aromatic caution trait is consistently threaded through perception and action, giving the character a distinctive, if passive, coherence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the uncorking reconfigures Elias’s stance toward grief and the lanterns soften, a resonant reweighting with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the vial’s mechanics are never motivated, so the hospital-greenhouse hops read like magical set-pieces rather than因果 tightening. Orientation is clear by word 60, well within waiver. The single micro-turn (hesitate → uncork) is sufficient for this length, but the escalation is spectral, not tactical, keeping the lens at Accumulative/Textural. Cost is legible in the final image: “the lanterns themselves were comforting him,” a conceptual repricing that makes the shop’s warmth newly earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>City-alley shop, fogged greenhouse, and sterile hospital are sketched with scent-first economy; each locale is filtered through Elias’s jasmine-rain trauma, so setting doubles as emotional micro-climate. The ultraviolet vial and extinct-plant jars are concrete props that constrain vision and memory, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the dream-shifts; no floating rooms. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent > sight) keeps exposition lean, though “crystal shadows” flirts with poetic overload once or twice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Elias confront the scent-memory he has avoided? Pressure mounts accumulatively via each vial-vision, tightening his affective knot rather than narrowing external options. The meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes the pattern—scent as anchor to love and loss—yet the shift is internal recognition, not a forked decision with tangible cost. No external antagonist or resource loss is risked; consequence is emotional reconfiguration, sufficient under Accumulative lens but short of visible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges scent-first: memory persists as atmospheric residue that must be inhaled, not shelved. Subtext operates in the ultraviolet glow—truth of tears—without authorial gloss. Final image reframes the shop’s lanterns from merchandise to companions, a quiet conceptual repricing that avoids moralizing. The jasmine-rain motif gains retrospective weight yet could have been sharpened by an earlier counter-scent to create ironic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction stays consistent, slightly archaic (“aromatically cautious”) without register drift. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative voice: syntax lengthens during memory shards, shortens at uncorking, mirroring inhalation rhythm. Perceptual signature—scent as portal—is sustained; no head-hopping. One minor cadence hiccup: “crystal shadows of his shop seemed to soften” repeats the prompt phrase almost verbatim, drawing attention to itself.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and largely loop-free; metaphor count is high but pattern-taught early (ultraviolet = revelation). One paraphrase loop: “the vial’s glow intensified” appears twice within five lines. No mixed metaphors or strained physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line softly resolves via image. Minor scaffold: “its surface shimmered with a faint ultraviolet glow, as though it held a secret” could compress to “its ultraviolet shimmer hinted at a secret,” but the slack is marginal.</comment>

<comment>Premise—perfume vial that distills memory-scent—is fresh, yet execution leans on established magical-realist tropes (objects reveal dead loved ones). Jasmine-rain specificity keeps the trope from being generic, and the lantern-shop backdrop offers an organic metaphor for curated memory. Risk is moderate: the dream-portal structure is safe, not formally daring. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, but not startlingly non-obvious.</comment>
