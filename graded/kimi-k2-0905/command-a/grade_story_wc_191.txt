<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s “wisely adventurous” trait is shown through cautious mural-reading and the ruby flake test, but interiority stays generic; no contradictory impulses appear, and the throne renunciation is smooth rather than costly. The flake’s hum is the only embodied emotion; the rest is summary. Micro-choices (peeling paint, placing flake) align with trait, yet no flaw complicates them. Closure reads as epiphany, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mural reveals → flake confirms → staircase opens → throne rejects singular claim. Orientation anchored by word 30; no spatial drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the throne dissolves into collective wisdom—visible cost signaled by blinding starlight that forces Lira’s retreat. One mechanism glitch: the mural sequence is learned off-stage, not dramatized, but payoff still lands.</comment>

<comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall and pulsing fruit compress color and time into a single perceptual field; the flake’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean—“stepped behind the veil”—no impossible moves. Sensory selection skews visual; other senses only gestured. Setting constraints (time, color, flake resonance) directly shape unlock sequence and ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach throne before sunrise—announced early; sunrise never presses again, so tension plateaus. Escalation delivered through mural discoveries and mechanism puzzle; each correct click forecloses wrong path. Cost is conceptual loss of personal power, felt in final star-bright moment. Agency present at each puzzle beat; luck absent. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective wisdom over individual rule emerges through throne’s rejection and star convergence; no authorial statement. Ruby flake motif reweights from “key” to “offering,” echoing shift without moralizing. Subtext carried by spiral and star imagery; silence after light fade invites reader re-pricing. Avoids tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers about who next ascends.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira; perceptual signature leans on color vocabulary that matches waterfall palette. Syntax remains steady, modest modulation under stress. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction alone—occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hum,” “conceptual cost”) nudges register toward allegory but holds. Ruby flake personified glow is the one texture tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free; sentence openings vary. Figurative language sparse, avoiding mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances discovery or image. One scaffold trace: “the stairway of ascension” repeated three times without new charge; minor. No typos, tense stable. Final line lands on image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Unclaimed throne” trope flipped into anti-coronation; ascension becomes abdication of ego. Orchard/timefall color palette freshens portal fantasy without lore dump. Spiral staircase and star dome echo prior videogame vistas, but mural-peel method offers tactile novelty. Risk is modest—conceptual rather than structural—but execution coherent. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
