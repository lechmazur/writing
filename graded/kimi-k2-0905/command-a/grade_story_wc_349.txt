<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mending others while seeking her own origin—surfaces early but never sharpens into a visible micro-choice under pressure. The climax (cutting the ledge) is rendered in cool summary, so the “felt cost” is only asserted. No contradictory bodily reaction or visible flaw manifests; the blank book merely receives moonlight without testing her. She reads as a serene plot agent rather than a person whose limits skew the outcome.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the pouring moonlight reconfigures meaning, turning scattered fragments into cohering stories with a visible conceptual cost. Causality, however, is soft: the vial’s placement is “no accident” but lacks beat-level pressure; the ledge-cut is painless, the blank page a gift rather than a forced choice. Orientation is achieved early (who/where/when by line 6), so no cap triggered. A micro-turn (blank page) qualifies, but the cost is aesthetic, not personal, keeping the score shy of 7+.</comment>

<comment>Glass orchard library is perpetual micro-setting: shelves end mid-air, books hover, clouds swirl beneath feet. These concrete oddities guide tactics—Elara must climb, balance, cut. Sensory triage is POV-filtered: ink scent > visual shimmer > hush of shifting glass. No exposition dump; world rules are learned kinesthetically. Cloud-sea and crystalline branches return in the final image, recharging the closure. Could edge higher if environment physically resisted the incision or levied tactile cost.</comment>

<comment>Stake—“find where stories begin”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss (time, bodily risk, social credit) is mounted on its failure. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical: shelves align, whispers coalesce, but Elara’s options never narrow; she merely witnesses the library self-assemble. The one decisive action (incising) is smooth, safe, and consequence-free. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens, satisfying the Accumulative pattern yet staying lightweight.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—fragmentation becoming whole—emerges through image (hovering books → aligned shelves) rather than explicit statement, dodging moralizing. Subtextual charge: patrons’ “paroles” imply untold regrets, letting readers map their own absences onto the glow. Final blank-then-shining page offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stories are authored by those who dare pour their found light. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5 band; no lived counter-argument complicates the harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“store’s very first opening day,” “vial… pulsating with a rhythm that seemed to echo the clouds”—carries a hushed, glass-bright timbre consistent throughout. Syntax elongates for ascent, shortens at incision, mirroring breath. Dialogue absent, so voice reliance on cadence and image is correct. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to”) prevents top-band crispness but does not leak artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, clauses layered like glass panes, but avoidable scaffold creeps in: “the library seemed to hold its breath, the clouds below swirling in unison” repeats the prior beat’s motion. Metaphors stay coherent (glass orchard / cloud sea) and physically compatible. No synonym loops, no template cadence runs. Density is solid—each sentence layers atmosphere and motion—yet minor pruning could excise two “seemed to” filters without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise—floating transparent library bearing fruit-like books—feels fresh, executed with sensory specificity rather than abstract whimsy. “Quantifying absence” as incision tool is a conceptual leap that marries math and magic, paid off when blank pages absorb moonlight into words-on-the-fly. Integration of “parole” as narrative seed flips legal jargon into poetic payload. Risk is moderate; stakes stay internal, but the conceptual coherence and lyrical payoff mark a memorable, non-derivative miniature.</comment>
