<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is anchored in embodied micro-choices (refusing to draw the blade, soil-touching ritual) and her father-shadow grants credible internal tension; the final acceptance of the sheathed blade is a renunciation that costs her absolute pacifist identity, visible in the closing smile. Kael stays a functional accessory, so relationship-as-crucible is thin, and the “senselessly perceptive” trait is named but never tested by contradiction or cost. Still, her hierarchy of values (plants > violence) is legible every beat, and the earned stasis lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tower fall → farm refuge → Kael warning → blade acceptance, each a because/therefore pivot. Closure is Earned Stasis: she keeps the farm and the blade, peace now contingent on potential violence—cost is the forfeiture of uncomplicated innocence, crystallized in the final image of sheathed weapon beneath blooming roses. No orientation debt; anchors clear by word 50. One telegraph: Kael’s arrival is slightly coincidence-shaped, but accepted within situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass dome, desert waste, and living soil are filtered through Elara’s touch-POV, constraining her range of movement and anchoring the pacifist ethic. The engraved scrap re-enters to stabilize trellises, a micro-setting object that literally holds the garden up—meets 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is tactile-first, obeying her “senselessly perceptive” frame. Spatial choreography clean; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect sanctuary without bloodshed. Tightening occurs when Kael offers the blade—pacifist path narrows to “armed neutrality.” Cost is legible: she shoulders the psychological weight of potential violence, shown by fingertips on the scabbard at dusk. escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—continuity through chaos—emerges via plant imagery and the decision to keep the blade, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: Kael’s dust-covered cloak vs. Elara’s soil-stained hands quietly debate survival modes. Final image reframes “quiet” from pacifist ideal to armed peace—conceptual repricing without exposition. No thematic echo penalty; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains Elara’s tactile perceptual signature; diction stays within farmer-pacifist lexicon. Rhythm breathes—long reflective sentences in garden, shorter beats at intrusion. No dialogue artifacts; sparse speech carries subtext. Filter verbs minimal and motivated; no head-hop. Voice modulation under stress: “heart tightened” is short, immediate, before returning to calm cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences usually twin-job (develop atmosphere + advance beat). No scaffold loops; metaphors mixed only once (“tranquil blaze”) but flagged intentionally for tone. Opening line anchors stakes and scent; final line re-weights “quiet.” Punctuation clean, no simultaneity errors. One paraphrase pocket: “shadow she could never fully escape” restated later as “father-shadow,” minor −0.2, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter is fresh enough; desert-rose-glass-dome is vivid synthesis. “Quiet” engraved scrap repurposed as trellis weight avoids gadget flirtation. Risk lies in armed-pacifist stance—morally nuanced, not gimmick. Could transfer to other settings, but specific plant lore and blade etiquette feel bespoke. No derivative-premise penalty.</comment>
