<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism is asserted (“charmed skeptic”) rather than dramatized; she kneels and accepts the shell without visible interior resistance, so the promised contradiction never plays out in scene. The final shift to “independence” is declared, not shown through a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry is now inside her and the orchid has dimmed—an image that reweights the premise. Causality is soft: the shell “chooses” her off-stage, so the decisive turn feels handed over rather than earned by prior action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden, orchid, shell, and twilight star are filtered through Elara’s attention and return in the final image; the dimming orchid literalizes the reconfiguration. Spatial grounding is maintained with tactile detail (moss, petals, hum), and the environment’s fading light quietly forces the moment toward dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stake—“translate isolation into independence”—is stated early but never tested by an on-page trade-off; the shell simply floods her with feelings and the outcome is assured. No option is foreclosed, no price is exacted; pressure stays flat across the single beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of archival transformation emerges through the orchid-to-tapestry image rather than exposition, but the emotional cost is abstract. The final line’s “promise of new beginnings” drifts toward platitude, blunting the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“velvet garden,” “tragically radiant”) risks purple but remains consistent with the fairy-tale register. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens effectively during the shell-contact beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the twilight pacing; metaphor density is high yet coherent. Occasional template cadence (“She saw…, she understood…”) and filler phrases (“seemed to”) slightly dull propulsion, but no loops scar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Memory-garden as external hard-drive is a fresh twist on the “object holds feelings” trope, and the half-shell rather than a whole one adds asymmetry. The risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the piece commits fully to its fairy-tale logic.</comment>
