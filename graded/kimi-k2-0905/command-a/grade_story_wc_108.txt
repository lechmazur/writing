<comment>Interiority is concrete—fear of identity-theft is shown through tactile contact with the shell and cast, not labeled. The “trembling certainty” refrain embodies contradiction under pressure. Micro-choice chain (trace shell → lift cast → decrypt → take key → enter mirror room) links motive to action, but the mirror epiphany drifts toward tidy self-actualization rather than a flaw-compounding mistake; cost is felt but not dramatized as irreversible. Voice stays distinct; no occupational stunt detail is needed here.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: shell vibration → find cast → decrypt → key → mirror room → shattering reflections. Each beat narrows options; the final “You are what you choose” is a Conceptual Repricing that rewrites her rule-set. Cost is visible—the mirrors crack, foreclosing the path of endless doubling. One minor causality bump: the key’s exact prior function is elided, but it is accepted as inherited clue rather than deus ex machina.</comment>

<comment>Rusted library is sketched with selective sensory strokes—iron groan, starlight through gaps, dust smudges—never catalogued. The seashell and cast act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only their physical surfaces yield the code. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object leaps. Setting charges the final image: starlight on broken glass fuses external ruin with internal release, passing the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen identity—signals early and tightens through each decoding micro-victory. One meaningful deepening: the notes reveal “life stolen and rewritten,” raising the cost of failure. Agency remains with Elara throughout; no outside rescue. The mirror shatter is the visible price, satisfying the 8.8+ cost legibility requirement, though escalation is single-cycle rather than layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “vulnerability as power” emerges via shell-whisper and cracked mirrors rather than explicit sermon. Subtext rests in the act of reading smudged child-hand writing—innocence corrupted—without spelling out guilt. Final reconfiguration avoids moralizing; the voice offers a Charged Poise that invites multiple readings. A hairline slip: the mirror-voice line edges toward thesis-statement, capping score just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains consistent psychic distance; perception skews toward tactile paranoia—cool shell, groaning beams. Syntax tightens under stress: clipped clauses mirror racing thoughts. No head-hop; shell-whisper stays external/ambiguous, preserving POV modesty. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” level diction in “trembling certainty” refrain—is justified as incantatory interior mantra.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance either decoding progress or sensory mood. Rhythmic variety alternates between long atmospheric fragments and sharp action beats. No scaffold loops; metaphor count stays low, avoiding purple fog. A single mixed image—“mirrors began to crack… into light”—is momentarily physical-impossible but reads as surreal culmination, not clarity break, so penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stunt-double identity theft in ruined starlit library is fresh synthesis; mirrors as multiplicity trope is familiar but reweighted by stunt-trade context. Specificity resides in shell-cast cipher rather than generic clue. Risk-taking shows in quiet lyric closure instead of set-piece fight, yet concept stays safely psychological. Not fully “inevitable in hindsight,” but memorable enough for short-form venue.</comment>
