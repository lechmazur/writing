<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “transform scars into stories” is concrete and embodied through the quill-triggered crystallization beat. Interiority stays specific—heartbeat as metronome, trembling fingers—without slipping into therapy-speak. The micro-choice to revisit superstitions mid-crisis shows contradictory impulses (scholar vs. child) in-scene, earning the final calm. Cost is visible: quill smooths only after she accepts the fear, foreclosing the old coping loop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill’s return to sleekness reconfigures the rule-set—fear acknowledged, platform now sanctuary—cost felt in the same breath. Causal lens holds: because she confronts the superstition, therefore the quill de-crystallizes and the storm pauses. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“floating rock tea ceremony platform”) and never breaks. One scaffold loop—“the platform swayed gently, as if in sync with her thoughts”—dulls momentum but misses the climax beat, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The platform-as-micro-setting constrains every motion: sway synchronizes with heartbeat, abyss below prevents retreat, steam mingles with storm mist to charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—obsidian glint, bitter tea, rain’s single tap—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: quill tracked in hand, tea set remains centered, body kneels then stands. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism—storm ceases because she stops feeding it, not because weather obeys theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will fear or mastery rule the next stroke—tightens when crystallization threatens to derail the ceremony. One meaningful deepening: revisiting superstition is not nostalgia but tactical grounding that narrows options to “face it or fail.” Cost is legible: the quill’s reversion is simultaneous with her audible breath, making the price physiological. No external coincidence; storm recedes only after internal shift, satisfying causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: scars → stories is enacted, not asserted, via the quill’s physical state. Final image—platform now sanctuary—reweights earlier dread without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: calm may be temporary, but that uncertainty is thematic strength, not flaw. One near-echo of “breath between storms” in closing paragraph is acceptable because it reprises the title concept with new weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholar-poetic—“runes to the wind,” “elastic time”—consistent with rune-trained attention. Rhythm modulates: long vowel-rich sentences under mist, then clipped fragments at crystallization beat. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful (“she felt” appears once at genuine surprise point).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences carry double duty (steam curls + mingles with mist). One paraphrase loop: “time felt elastic, stretching and contracting like the breath she now held” immediately followed by “her breath caught” creates conceptual echo—deduct −0.2. No mixed metaphors; crow-quill-as-frost is single, sustained vehicle. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are clean.</comment>

<comment>Floating tea-platform above abyss is fresh staging for inner-outer storm convergence. Crystallizing quill literalizes stress without feeling gimmick because rule is taught early and paid off. “Breath between storms” as literal held breath risks cliché but is saved by bodily enactment. Overall synthesis feels inevitable rather than clever-for-its-own-sake.</comment>
