<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—she “belongs to the shadows,” “heart quickened,” “whispered names.” One micro-choice: placing the globe on the altar. No contradictory impulses under pressure; reflection dominates over live scene. Closure is a tender renunciation, but the cost is poetic rather than felt on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is lyrical-accumulative; closure is a Charged Poise (globe clears, names spoken, dawn light). No causal tightening—dream fragments arrive gift-wrapped; no narrowing options. Orientation anchor late (~130 w), but disorientation is thematic and pays off. Cost is aesthetic, not visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Arctic night, ice shrine, melted globe—vivid, selective, POV-filtered. Shrine constrains the ritual; globe micro-setting charges final image. Sensory balance narrows to candle flicker and cracked glass under pressure. Early anchors skim, but spatial choreography holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stake: “voice the voiceless” signalled late; no on-page test or price. Escalation is declarative—each dream adds data, not risk. No trade-off; tension is atmospheric. Coincidence drives revelation; agency is contemplative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—salvaging purity from loss—emerges via recurrent globe imagery. Subtext muted; baker/librarian dreams tell rather than imply. Final image reframes globe as intact memory, a gentle CR. Avoids moralizing, but complexity is lyrical, not moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close to Elara; perceptual signature relies on frosty phrasing (“borrowed starlight,” “fragments of others’ stories”). Rhythm controlled, no head-hop. Free indirect style clean; register stays within her mystic lexicon. Dialogue absent; voice sustains atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyric cadence occasionally loops (“whispers of the lost,” “whispered names”) – light template. Metaphors coherent but plentiful; density high yet propulsive. No scaffold; paragraph cuts tight. Final line earns its uplift. Minor synonym churn on “ice/shrine/candles” cluster.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ghost-whispering via strangers’ dreams is fresh; snow-globe-as-ark familiar but re-framed. Arctic shrine feels new. “Cameo appearances in dreams” concept under-used—could swap for Tarot with minor edits. Emotional specificity in mother-painter thread is strong. Risk is lyrical, not structural.</comment>
