<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—arsonist’s seed vs. firefighter self—remains abstract; the “spark of compassion” is declared, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her. The graft act is tactile, but its emotional ante (reject village scorn? risk failure openly?) is never sharpened so the turn feels symbolic rather than personally hazardous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: single scene, orienting cues by word 40, one deepening beat (kneeling to coin-and-seeds burial) that reweights the sterile sand into possible soil. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of “scars can sing” humming beneath the final image—earned by iterative pattern (fire ↔ life, coin ↔ foreign hope) and visible cost: she rises “hands stained.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Black sand, obsidian lagoon, kelp-drift, and migrating clouds are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze; the sand’s sterility directly thwarts her goal, so environment constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy adheres to her firefighter habit—texture over color, weight over sound—anchoring without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove scars (personal, village, land) can bloom. Pressure grows texturally—each reference to infertile sand tightens the likelihood of failure—culminating in the one decisive act of graft; cost is the gamble of public shame if the patch dies. No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated fire/life duality and foreign-into-local assimilation; “scars can sing” is never moralized but embodied in the final image of stained hands listening to quiet melody of possibility. Subtext operates in the coin’s drilled hole—absence that lets sand pass—suggesting redemption through imperfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice: long cadenced sentences mirror cloud migration; diction stays volcanic-�“obsidian,” “black sand,” “sterile”�—rooted in Elara’s sensory lexicon. No dialogue, so vocal identity rests in the textured interior monologue that tightens into shorter clauses at the burial beat, teaching the rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density (every sentence advances image or pressure). Occasional elevated register (“conceptual cost,” “unyielding compassion”) nudges out of POV lexicon; two paraphrase loops (“black sand… black sand,” “lagoon… lagoon edge”) dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arson-bequeathed firefighter healing land with fire-forged coin seed-drill—turns familiar redemption arc into geologic metaphor. Specific volcanic micro-setting and inverted patricide stigma keep it from template; kelp-drift tone adds eco-lyric layer uncommon in rural-arson tales.</comment>
