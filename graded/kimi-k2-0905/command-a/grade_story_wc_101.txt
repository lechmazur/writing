<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is declared early and never contradicted, but interiority stays generic: “heart pounding,” “weight of her secret suddenly lighter.” No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she never considers abandoning the runs or fears exposure beyond a momentary freeze. The final “peace she hadn’t known in years” is told, not embodied. Micro-choices (ringing the bell, stepping into light) advance plot yet reveal no deeper value hierarchy or flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is linear and coherent: anonymous runs → discovery → public gathering → communal pledge. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s ring reconfigures the community’s self-image with felt cost—the exposure of Mara’s anonymity. However, the escalation is gentle; no option is foreclosed and no tangible resource is lost. The story remains a single shard; default scope met, orientation clear by line 6, lens stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, cracked tiles, moonlight, and lantern glow are vivid and filtered through Mara’s covert attention. The ridge and wind are repeatedly invoked yet never constrain movement or supply tangible obstacles; the arbor functions mainly as symbolic backdrop rather than active environment. Micro-setting succeeds: the silver bell’s chill weight and clear tone are tactile and auditory anchors. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival via intergenerational support—is declared early and never seriously tested. Pressure stays communal and atmospheric; Mara faces no personal trade-off once she chooses to reveal herself. The only tightening is the widow’s call, which Mara immediately diffuses. No resource is spent, no relationship damaged, no path foreclosed; cost is emotional but not dramatized as loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutual obligation emerges through the bell and the food runs rather than authorial statement. Final image of “amplified quiet” offers a resonant reconfiguration, yet the story spells out the moral—“families build for the future”—in dialogue. Subtext is present but thin; the bell’s symbolism is announced rather than discovered. Emotional aftereffect is warm yet unsurprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays close to Mara; no head-hopping. Syntax is clean, diction elevated but consistent: “terra-cotta arbor,” “amplified quiet.” Distinct perceptual signature is moderate; wind and moonlight recur but do not color every observation. Dialogue is sparse and functional; widow’s lines carry no subtext. Rhythm is steady, with minor template cadence in “she spoke of…she said…she lifted.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, mostly varied openings; no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystallized final moment”) verge on workshop diction but stay within voice. Information density is solid; each paragraph advances situation or image. No metaphor clashes or scaffold sentences; closing line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—clandestine mutual aid in sanctioned exile—is familiar, yet the silver bell as quiet call sign freshens it. Specificity of terra-cotta ridge and midnight bread runs keeps the world from feeling generic. No radical formal risk; arc plays out predictably once the widow speaks. Emotional specificity is present but not unforgettable.</comment>
