<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Foresight’s obsession is declared early and the final “resonance” epiphany is internally consistent, but the piece never lets us watch a real-time choice that costs something; the bunker ritual is all trance and no fork. Interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“consciousness expanding”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The result is a credible arc, yet one that feels observed rather than risked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dissolved wafer seal reconfigures the central question—paths choose walkers through resonance—so we get a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the seal’s loss). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each dream-batch adds density until the pattern breaks at the storm’s peak. The orientation waiver applies; deliberate disorientation (hidden bunker, shifting glyphs) pays off in the final image. One causality quibble: the directive’s rules are never tested in a way that could fail, so the tightening is more revelation than jeopardy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: its wafer-locked door, shifting wall-patterns, and storm-beaten roof constrain tempo and attention. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (botanist precision on vines, engineer eye on fractals) and integrates with action rather than pausing for postcards. The forest outside stays generic, but the bunker itself is irreplaceable to the closure image—its light-dappled corridors collapse into the seal’s dissolution—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why do paths choose walkers?”—is signaled early and deepens through each dream iteration. Pressure escalates texturally: storm + glyph motion + seal glow tighten the cadence rather than narrow external options. No visible price is paid (no failed decoding, no bodily drain), so the cost stays intellectual rather than visceral, capping the score below 7.5. Still, the final reconfiguration is earned within the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the decay of fixed agency into mutual resonance. Subtext lives in the bunker’s architecture—order playfully eroding into organic drift—mirroring the idea without stating it. The ending avoids moralizing; the dissolved seal is an image, not a lesson. One abstract phrase too many (“fabric of reality”) keeps this just shy of the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Foresight’s perceptual quirks—botanical metaphors, engineer cadence, recursive self-questioning. Rhythm swells with storm and glyph pulse, then fractures into short clauses at the epiphany. No dialogue, so voice carries all melodic work; the diction never drifts above the character’s plausible lexicon. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to dance, seemed to dissolve”) prevents 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is controlled—one metaphor per beat, each extending the vine/light motif. One mixed moment (“vines curled like serpents” beside “ethereal grit”) lightly blurs tone but does not touch the closure beat. Information density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dream-decoding hermit in a rewilded bunker is familiar, yet the “precisely playful” architecture and resonance-as-path-choice re-weight the trope. Specific fractal wall-patterns and the coin-sized wafer seal give tactile freshness. The piece risks a quiet, lyric ending rather than a twist, trusting image over shock—an authentic stance. It doesn’t break the mold, but it bends it memorably.</comment>
