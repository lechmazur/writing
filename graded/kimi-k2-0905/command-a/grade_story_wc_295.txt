<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically voiced but abstract; “she sought not just knowledge but a way to heal the fractured memories of her past” tells motive before we see it tested. The only embodied contradiction is trembling fingers at the telescope; no micro-choice risks failure or exposes flaw under pressure. The decisive internal shift (she can now carry her own burdens) is declared rather than dramatized with a visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the telegram’s message is reweighted into a rule that “no burden was meant to be carried alone.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—star patterns and inscription fragments accrete until meaning crystallizes. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the reader sees the idea dawn but not a concrete forfeiture or path foreclosed. causal linkage is loose: star-alignment coincidence drives the insight more than any irreversible choice she makes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Observatory dome, telescope hum, and star rhythms are vividly filtered through Elara’s chronicler gaze; environment steers attention and pacing. The daylily telegram functions as micro-setting, handled twice and mirrored in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across adjusting lenses and note-scribbling. Sensory selection narrows under urgency, though some phrases (“river of light,” “midnight solace”) drift toward soft abstraction.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is decoding the inscription to heal herself, signaled early. Pressure accrues via pattern recognition rather than narrowing options; the star-pattern revelation deepens meaning but does not foreclose an alternative path or extract a visible price. No tangible resource—time, social credit, bodily safety—is risked or lost. Escalation is informational, not tactical; the protagonist’s stance toward her past softens, yet the shift is announced, not paid for with an on-page sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through star-map and telegram recurrence; final reweighting avoids moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image—daylily fragility equating with vulnerability—but the equation is stated once (“its fragility a testament…”), trimming subtlety. Insight is asserted rather than earned through a painful trade-off. Emotional aftereffect is gentle uplift rather than complex residue, leaving the concept slightly tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent cosmic diction and rhythmic uplift; perceptual signature is star-directed and chronicler-detached. Compression in peak beats (“She scribbled notes furiously”) keeps momentum. No dialogue to test naturalism. Occasional template cadence (“The…, the…” anaphora) is pattern-taught and pays off in final paragraph, justifying repetition. Register stays elevated but plausible for a word-healer; no head-hopping or distance drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “began to”) could be trimmed. Metaphors are coherent but stack in closing lines (“river of light,” “tapestry of hope”) without fresh sensory payoff, creating mild purple tint. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; pronoun and action order remain clear. Final sentence cadence lands cleanly, but earlier scaffolding (“As she…”) repeats three times—minor template artifact that dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing lucid-dream chronicler with celestial cartography gives fresh vocational texture; star-map as Rosetta Stone for trauma is novel. Telegram pressed in daylily feels specific and organic to theme. Risk is lyrical accumulation rather than dramatic stakes, but coherence justifies the choice. Premise avoids stock templates; emotional core remains universal, yet detail keeps it from being swappable with another name or place.</comment>
