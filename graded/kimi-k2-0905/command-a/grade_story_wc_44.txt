<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet deliberation is shown through meticulous rune etching and the patient dawn vigil at the isle’s lip; the key’s growing glow externalizes her interior progress. Missing is a moment where her flaw or blind-spot visibly jacks up cost—she succeeds too smoothly, so the final beat feels earned but not painfully paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is pristine: key → relearning runes → closing loops → noon-void demonstration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—midday shadow physics is rewritten and the key’s new weight is felt. One tightening beat suffices; no orientation or logic slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating-isle tether strain and the workshop’s half-built automaton anchor spatial choices; the key’s brass grooves and copper plate etch act as micro-setting that constrains every runic stroke. Atmospheric density is selective, never stalls motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>The dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early; one decisive escalation at the precipice void reweights the world rule. Cost is conceptual (shadow physics rewritten) rather than visceral, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of relearning lost knowledge: each loop closed rewrites natural law. Final image of the dormant, heavy key offers non-literal answer—wisdom itself becomes ballast. Avoids overt moral, but stays slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains calm, scholarly perceptual signature: “echoes of a forgotten song,” “faint resonance.” No head-hop; syntax tightens under pressure (“key clutched tightly”). Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; copper-plate etching sentences layer tactile detail without clogging. One paraphrase loop (“the key…its purpose”) and a stock metaphor (“vortex”) keep it sub-8.8. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of scholar-plus-artifact is refreshed by making the mystery physics-based (midday shadow void) and the tool a rune-etched clockwork key. Quiet risk—no villain—pays off through conceptual repricing rather than spectacle.</comment>
