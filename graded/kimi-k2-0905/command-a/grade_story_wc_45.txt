<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“heart pounding,” “bones being reset”), but contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized; the renunciation of the stone is smooth yet not visibly costly. The changeling-guilt motive is named, not embodied, so the final stride feels therapeutic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tooth → maze → fountain → star, each because/therefore link legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone-for-certainty swap reweights her rule-set with felt cost (“lighter and fuller”). The Orientation Test is waived—garden disorientation is taught early and paid off in the mirror-fountain image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory economy: jasmine, gravel crunch, mirror-dark water. The tooth-as-micro-setting constrains two beats (satchel weight, fountain glow) and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; spatial choreography is clean. Hedge maze geography stays vague, but that serves the disorientation pattern rather than harms clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mend truths”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the fountain demands a piece of certainty, foreclosing her control. Cost is visible (stone sinking, warmth), but escalation is single-step rather than deepening; coincidence plays no role. Agency is renunciation, not tactic-altering struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images of glowing fragments and constellation metaphor; no explicit moral. The final “dawn” image reweights earlier mistakes as light-source, achieving quiet resonance. Nostalgic innovation is stated, not textured, so subtext stays modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “weight…resting heavy,” “boots crunching.” Syntax is smooth, lyrical, with purposeful repetition of “mistakes into constellations” that teaches the pattern. No dialogue, so voice remains consistent; diction within plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often moves plot, image, and interiority. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with beats. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges tooth-star motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale tropes (changeling, secret garden) are re-angled through skeptic protagonist and conceptual cost rather than wonder. The tooth-to-star transformation feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk is moderate—lyric causal arc rather than world-revision—so no bonus.</comment>
