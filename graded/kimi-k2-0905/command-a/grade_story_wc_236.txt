<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s anosmia-driven attention to silent detail is dramatized through micro-choices—handling the screw, listening to fog-drip, renouncing smell-centered nostalgia—and the final renunciation of regaining scent is refused with quiet cost, earning her “trembling calm.” Interiority stays concrete and sensorily displaced; no diagnostic shorthand. Relationship pressure with Mira is light but sufficient to force Elara’s confession of shared fragility, shifting both women’s stance. Only flaw: Mira’s grandmother remains off-page, so secondary-character pressure is implied rather than staged, capping the score just below 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, drip, screw, and scent-loss accrete until the final image reweights “ordinary miracle.” Orientation is clean inside 70 words; no teleporting objects. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara palms the screw, accepts occluded senses, and the phrase “trembling calm” is repriced as earned stasis; cost is felt in her relinquishing the hope of restored smell. One soft spot: the screw’s back-story arrives late via Mira’s exposition; the piece teaches the pattern early enough to waive penalty, but the causal link is slightly diluted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog, brass gears, and the midwife screw function as micro-setting that constrain tactile choice; the shop’s drip cadence literally times Elara’s breath. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—no smell, so touch and hearing sharpen—and the worn threads of the screw mirror her own eroded certainties. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bench, window, fogged glass track across beats. The screw’s final placement beside the repaired clock charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elara re-humanize a world she can no longer scent? Pressure tightens when the screw’s history is revealed, forcing her either to keep yearning for smell or embrace “occluded views.” The meaningful turn is her deliberate handing-back of the screw and the internal vow to read silence—options narrow, cost is the permanent loss of olfactory identity. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 750-word scale; no reversal for Mira, yet Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: ordinary miracles reside in unnoticed sensory channels once the expected one is amputated. No explicit thesis; final image of screw beside heartbeat clock reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Elara closing her eyes, Mira’s hesitation—rather than declaration. The拒绝 of smell-restoration avoids sentimental triumph; ambiguity lingers about what “seeing” replaces scent, inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Elara’s perceptual exile: diction favors haptic and auditory nouns (“brass gears,” “breath of ancient mechanisms”). Rhythm lengthens in calmer beats, shortens under screw scrutiny, mirroring her trembling calm. No head-hopping; Mira’s interiority surfaced only through Elara’s inference. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she sensed,” “she felt”) and paid off in the final compressed paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyric-compressed yet propulsive; sentences multitask (“its windows fogged with the breath of ancient mechanisms” sets tone, place, and metaphor). No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances situation or emotion. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift, e.g., “echoes of countless births” is single allowed poetic reach and is grounded in tactile handling of screw. Ear-test rhythm is varied; opening long sentence contrasts with clipped final line, underscoring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: anosmic aromatherapist maps emotion through non-olfactory channels, converging on midwife artifact—two rarely paired realms. The inversion of “scent as default sense” lends conceptual novelty without gimmickry. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric accumulation rather than external plot, but coherence holds. Slight deduction for familiar “grandmother’s heirloom” device; specificity of screw’s worn threads and Elara’s sensory rerouting keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
