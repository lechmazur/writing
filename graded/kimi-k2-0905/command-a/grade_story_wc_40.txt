<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s scholarly reticence and obsession with the crystal are credibly drawn, but his interiority leans on thematic summary (“deep respect for the power of language”) rather than embodied contradiction. We see only one micro-choice—accepting the crystal’s energy drain—so the promised “hierarchy of values under pressure” is asserted, not dramatized. The final renunciation lands because earlier beats foreshadow the cost, yet the emotional texture is slightly monotone; his silence never cracks into revealing new information or risk. Acceptable, but not yet crucible-hot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-docket thickens the pattern until the crystal’s exhaustion becomes inevitable. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the blueprint for linguistic rebirth is gained at the price of the oracle itself—visible in “the crystal’s final echo lingered in the air.” Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, timeline anchored by “after the last dictionary was printed,” so no penalty. Causality is soft: the decoding method relies on intuitive “humming” rather than a rule-based trigger; the pivot feels more atmospheric than tactical, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library’s dust, tall windows, and suspended hush are filtered through Elias’s lonely attunement; the micro-setting doubles as the crystal cupped in his palms, a “tool” that literally constrains every action. Sensory economy is strong—sound (echoes), touch (worn oak), sight (first light) braid into mood without checklist drift. Spatial choreography is invisible (no body movement beyond standing), but acceptable for single-POV stillness. Final image recharges the hush: the whisper of hope exits the same acoustic space it entered, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost language—is declared early and tightened once: the crystal’s fading echo forces completion now or never. Agency is interior and accumulative rather than a sharp reversal; the “cost” (crystal will die) is known before the final beat, so escalation is steady, not spiky. Under Accumulative lens this suffices, yet the absence of a second live option keeps tension cerebral, not visceral. No price is paid on-page beyond the abstract foreknowledge, capping entry to upper-6 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language as fragile, crystalline, requiring sacrificial witness. The chandelier shard’s journey from glittering social light to algorithm of renewal embodies the idea without sermon. Final reprice—knowledge preserved, medium destroyed—avoids tidy moral. The after-effect is quiet elegy rather than triumphant rebuild, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is scholarly, auditory, slightly archaic (“testify to what he heard”) without register drift. Rhythm lengthens in calmer passages, shortens under crystal vibration, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on internal diction; occasional nominal padding (“phenomenon he had spent years studying”) slightly dulls immediacy but not enough to breach 7-floor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, loop-free; sentences vary in length and stem. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph—four consecutive sensory phrases beginning with “The” creates template cadence—but pattern is broken before critical beats. Metaphors (crystal as mausoleum, map, seed) cohere and do not contradict. No artifacts touch the closure line, satisfying the 7.0 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Echo-archive of extinct language inside chandelier crystal” is a fresh synthesis; execution keeps the concept concrete through sonic testing. Reticent scholar in post-dictionary world feels tailored, not generic. Risk is moderate—quiet stake, no twist—but coherence justifies the band. Could edge higher with a more visceral invention mid-text.</comment>
