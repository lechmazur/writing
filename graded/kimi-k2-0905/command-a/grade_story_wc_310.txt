<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is evocative—“quietly enthusiastic” governs her micro-gestures—but the text keeps telling us she is “determined” rather than enacting new contradiction once distillation begins; the coins carry memory yet never force a trade-off that visibly costs her. The final beat lands as affirmation, not renunciation, so the emotional price feels announced, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: coins → observatory → distillation → prophecy decode → coin sequence; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise—the coins reframed as roadmap—whose conceptual cost (universe’s rebirth burden) is legible in the last paragraph. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity; one soft spot: the prophecy’s rules are revealed retroactively rather than tested mid-process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ambered observatory is sketched with spare, sensorially filtered strokes—“rusted metal,” “static bursts,” “shimmering liquid”—that double as mood mirror; the distillation apparatus becomes micro-setting constraining every turn. Spatial choreography is tight; no tourism listings. 9+ gate missed only because the apparatus never malfunctions or limits her arm-span—tool fails to charge final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she wring meaning from contraction?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens exactly once when the first coin’s immersion forecloses the option to walk away. Escalation is causal under lens; cost is conceptual (sole responsibility for rebirth) rather than visceral, but legible on page. A second tightening beat is absent, keeping tension lyrical rather than crucible-hot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-creation after loss emerges inductively from coin→distill→prophecy pattern; no explicit sermon. The backwards prophecy’s reversal motif reweights earlier static imagery in the final glow, giving non-literal resonance. Ambiguity is preserved—rebirth is possible, not guaranteed—avoiding tidy moral. One −0.3 for the clause “wavelength align with purpose,” a near-thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person ventriloquizes Lira’s idiosyncratic attention—“stars whispered secrets in static bursts”—syntax stays compressed, scientific diction (“distillation apparatus”) filtered through awe. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for reflection, staccato for burst climax. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Filter verbs are minimal and earned. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences multi-task (action + image + world-rule). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, payoff-attested. One −0.3 for three consecutive “She…” openers mid-text that drum without teaching pattern. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene heat. Closure line is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-universal-contraction coin-oracle is fresh; backwards-time prophecy re-energizes familiar trope. Specificity of coin etymologies and static distillation method keeps concept from sliding into generic eschatology. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but coherence is high. Could swap cultures on coins without breaking arc, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
