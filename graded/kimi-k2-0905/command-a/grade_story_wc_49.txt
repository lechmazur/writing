<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to revive forgotten songs is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“heart swelled with hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly risks failure after the first hum; the vine’s cooperation feels inevitable. The moment she decides to keep singing is summarized, not dramatized with cost. Earned stasis arrives, yet the price is only implied by the glowing orbs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orbs reconfigure village futures and her purpose, cost legible in the shift from solitary seeker to teacher. Causal chain is thin—singing succeeds because moon + tendril “align,” not because she risks anything撤销le. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of rising luminosity escalates stakes by intensification rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Verdant arbor is sketched with selective sensory strokes—dew like stars, vine light spreading like liquid gold—each image charging the final glowing orbs. Micro-setting (workbench, tendril) constrains action: her fingers must trace it to unlock songs. Spatial choreography holds; no floating bodies. One forced seasonal cliché (“first light of dawn breaking”) keeps it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore forgotten remedies—signals early; escalation occurs via intensifying light pattern rather than protagonist trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; failure never threatens on-page. Cost is conceptual (future burden to teach) but not felt inside the scene. Alignment mechanic externalizes pressure, reducing agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through song emerges imagistically, not stated. Final orb-cluster reweights “golden stories” as living tools, offering resonant reconfiguration without moral. Ambiguity is present—will villagers accept?—but complexity is gentle. One soft thesis whisper (“she would spin stories of hope”) slightly over-articulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third lyrical-omniscient voice sustains rhythmic cadence that mirrors incantation; diction stays within fairy-tale register. No filter-verb clutter; perception remains tethered to Elara’s noticing. Syntax modulates with luminosity crescendo. One template loop—“golden” appears four times in eighty words—dulls final sparkle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pulses; paragraph breaks coincide with light beats. Sentences vary in length; no scaffold clutter. Metaphors (“light like liquid gold”) recur without fresh re-angle, creating mild synonym churn. No artifact obscures closure; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Forgotten harvest-moon songs as agricultural code is fresh, but “tinkerer” label never informs tools or mindset beyond goggles. Vine-as-key concept feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk level modest; fairy-tale template remains familiar. Specificity of orb-stories rescues from mid-band.</comment>
