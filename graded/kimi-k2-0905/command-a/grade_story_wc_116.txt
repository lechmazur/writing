<comment>Lira’s interiority is textured through tactile ritual (tracing the swan, “grip…looser”) and her witnessing stance is credibly strained by the library’s “heavier” air, but the decisive pivot—choosing to follow the map—arrives in a single declarative sentence without visible interior cost; the moment feels administered rather than wrested. The earned change (she “had become the silence”) is asserted in summary, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian mirror dissolves the refuge, rewrites her journals, and reweights her vocation to “preserve” silence itself; the cost is legible in the erased building and the pages she no longer remembers writing. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each image (swan, catacombs, mirror) layers density until the final silence crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The overgrown library is no backdrop: vines “embracing ancient tomes” smother choice, the obsidian refuge literally absorbs light, and the origami swan’s folds constrain navigation; these micro-settings charge the final image when Lira realizes she is “the silence.” Sensory selection is POV-specific—Lira notices “damp earth and forgotten memories,” not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the catacomb walk; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witness vs. intervene—tightens once: the swan’s tremor forces the first active choice. Escalation is textural: each symbol (swan, map, mirror) accrues mass until the renunciation of agency becomes inevitable; the price is the library’s future decay written into her journals. No reversal, but a single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the cost of perfect witness is self-erasure. The obsidian mirror’s conceptual repricing reweights “regenerative silence” from river balm to personal annihilation. No moralizing; the final line lets the river’s song stand as non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is her new silence liberation or burial?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable, rhythmic, and sensorily skewed to Lira’s cataloguing mind: “vine tendrils embracing tomes” reads as her professional metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax breathes with pressure—long clauses in library hush, fragment-like bursts during catacomb crawl. No dialogue, so voice carries full texture; diction stays within a keeper’s plausible lexicon. Final image’s spare cadence “she had become the silence” earns Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “Its folds shifted, revealing a hidden compartment…” advances plot and deepens mythic texture. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. One paraphrase loop—“the library felt heavier… the library no longer felt like a burden”—is forgivable because it marks the thematic pivot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: origami-as-map, silence-as-substance, mirror-as-annihilation. The “regenerative silence” concept re-prices itself from natural balm to existential cost. Risky second-person address is avoided; instead, the speculative frame commits fully. Proximity check: no close echoes of Borges or VanderMeer; the collapsing-library motif is re-rooted in personal witness rather than cosmic horror.</comment>
