<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is lyrically specific—‘weathered by time and resolve’ hands, silent recitation of ancient verses—yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps interior conflict conceptual rather than enacted. The final renunciation (stillness over motion) is foreshadowed by the canyon’s echo logic and the arrowhead’s compass reveal, so the cost feels legible but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—echo, dust, layered time—and closure arrives via Charged Poise: ‘the greatest journeys were those taken within’ reweights the arrowhead from tool to mirror. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no causality breaks; persistent constraint (the canyon’s echoic stillness) shapes the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bone towers, breathing walls, and dust that ‘settles into clarity’ are filtered through Kael’s harmonic perception; the canyon functions as both macro-setting and micro-instrument that teaches stillness. The arrowhead-as-compass turn is charged by the flock’s final pattern, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting/object must constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the arrowhead’s purpose—tightens when the flock’s pattern converts weapon to compass, foreclosing physical travel in favor of internal stillness. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible; pressure is coherent but muted because no external antagonist or resource is risked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: reverence for deep time collides with the futility of outward motion; the final image reweights ‘navigation’ as self-location. Ambiguity is purposeful—stillness is neither triumph nor defeat—and the reader carries the echo onward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled archaic cadence (‘a civilization that had mastered the art of stillness’) without lapsing into purple overload; perceptual signature is consistent—sound, dust, vibration—under peak pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; elision of time is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; only minor scaffold (‘their presence as subtle as…’) and one mixed metaphor (‘walls seemed to breathe with whispers’) but clarity intact. High information density—each paragraph layers setting, myth, and interior—without loop artifacts; closure image unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ornithomancy + geomancy + stillness-as-travel; canyon as tuning fork is memorable. Risk is lyric quietness rather than plot surprise; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, docking a hairline to reach 8.0.</comment>
