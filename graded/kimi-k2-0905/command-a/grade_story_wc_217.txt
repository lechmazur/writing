<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent—‘arranging thoughts like beads on a string’ is concrete—but micro-choices remain observational; no real contradictory impulse under pressure. The feather hand-off is the single pivot; its warmth is stated, not embodied, so the cost feels symbolic rather than lived. Motivation stays static: she already believes in fragments, so the ending restates rather than reweights her stance. Dialogue is soft-parabolic, not individuated; the wanderer’s voice folds into hers, flattening status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing kite-poem reconfigures meaning and the feather transferred is a visible constraint that shapes the final image—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality, however, is loose; the cut string arrives by coincidence and the kite’s magical text is an unexplained rule drift. Orientation is clear by line 6, but the ‘burnished hush’ lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than Situational, and the pattern is not taught early enough to feel inevitable. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying escalation under Accumulative rules, so the score clears the 6.8 bar but misses 7+ because the kite’s agency supersedes character causality.</comment>

<comment>Lagoon, wet earth, salt, and damp sand are selective, sensory, and filtered through the poet’s bias; the kite frame later becomes micro-setting that guides her fingers and choices. Spatial choreography is clean—footprints, tide line, water’s edge track logically. Weather is causal: dawn light and post-rain stillness enable reflection and the eventual wind pick-up for launch. No object or setting constrains the final image beyond the kite itself, capping entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is declared early; tightening occurs when the frayed string forces them to repair, but the cost is cooperative, not sacrificial. Agency is shared with the wanderer, diluting individual risk; no option is foreclosed for either. Pressure is situational and accumulative rather than causal; the kite’s glow is magical payoff, not consequence of prior risk. No credible loss (time, money, social credit) is dramatized, so the tightening lacks visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through image—fragmented poetry on cloth, unfinished kite—without overt thesis. The ‘woven dawns’ notion is returned in the glowing airborne poem, reweighting incompleteness as luminous rather than deficient. Subtext in gesture (feather exchange, synchronized repair) is stronger than in dialogue, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the kite’s language stays unread, preserving purposeful openness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—‘beads on a string,’ ‘burnished hush’—that reflects the poet’s attention. Syntax modulates with emotional rise: longer cadences for reflection, clipped clauses during kite launch. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to her senses even in dialogue beats. Diction stays within plausible poet lexicon; occasional soft abstraction (‘harmony in fragments’) is voice-motivated and paid off by closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate, paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is dense but patterned—mirror-lagoon, woven dawns—teaching its texture early, so density feels intentional rather than purple. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; props track cleanly. Minor scaffold: ‘his eyes fixed on the kite’ / ‘his gaze drifting to the horizon’ is a synonym loop, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—poet repairs magical poetry-kite with stranger—is fresh, but execution leans on familiar ‘broken yet beautiful’ template. Specificity of cobalt lagoon and drake feather lifts the material above cliché, yet the wanderer’s ‘lost ability to see beauty’ is abstract backstory. Final image of glowing airborne poem is an earned reconfiguration that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no structural experiment beyond lyric Accumulative pattern, which is safely executed.</comment>
