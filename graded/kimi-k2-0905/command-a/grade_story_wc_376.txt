<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s candor-tied gift is anchored in tangible craft, her trembling hands and wilting leaves dramatize contradiction under pressure; the moment she absorbs the lovers’ betrayal her leaves brown, embodying cost. Motivation stays crisp—truth as possible oasis-restoration—driving each descent and inscription. Interiority is concrete, no label-speak; flaw (fragile honesty) complicates tactics and forecloses social safety. The final choice to etch and broadcast the bitter truth earns its hope via prior causality, paying visible price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: map fragment → undercity chamber → truth of intentional sacrifice → Elara’s decision to engrave and release. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands on-page: chamber tremor and water trickle are Decisive Change with felt cost—her isolation and civic upheaval now inevitable. Persistent constraint (her candor-dependent craft) shapes tactics throughout; no outline-like "and-then" sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass-domed, toxic-skied Verdania is sketched with selective strokes—artificial light, recycled air—that mirror theme of artifice vs. truth. Undercity’s decay scent and damp walls narrow perception during crisis, guiding Elara’s urgency. Zinc plate’s faint hum and gilded leaves act as micro-setting tools that constrain action and charge closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment, body, and tool jointly shape the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost conversations to revive oasis—signals early and tightens when betrayal reveals civic complicity. Escalation driven by her agency: deciphering, descending, choosing to etch truth despite personal wilt. Cost is visible: social safety forfeited, studio isolation sealed, first water drops ambiguously threatening. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: candor as ecological and civic lifeline. Subtext lives in wilt/glow dichotomy and the lovers’ raw dialogue. Final image of new plate beside fragment reweights premise—truth as seed, not weapon—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: trickle may heal or flood, sustaining thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—attention to script hum, leaf color, damp air. Diction remains within her artisan lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm accelerates in undercity descent, shortens during leaf-wilt beat, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphs cut cleanly. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught via leaf-glow, paid off at closure. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory cue, interior tilt, and foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—truth-wielding calligrapher in domed eco-city—feels fresh yet inevitable. Candor as living vegetation stakes is non-obvious synthesis of craft and morality. Oasis-sacrifice twist grows from hints (artificial dependency) rather than late rule patch. Specific detail (zinc-etched plate, shredded map under floorboards) roots concept in tactile world.</comment>
