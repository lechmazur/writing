<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s “reckless” label is asserted but never dramatized—she steps cautiously, follows noise obediently, and the one risk (inserting the wheel) is presented as destiny, not choice. Interiority leans on stock phrases (“heart quickened,” “breath caught”) rather than embodied contradiction. The father–daughter conflict is back-story summary; no live relationship tests her stance. Closure obeys causality but the cost feels symbolic rather than personal—she is unchanged except for a stated “peace.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain (tunnel → wheel → machine → release) is legible and lands a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the ghost shift ends. Orientation is immediate; no seam artifacts. The “hush after confession” motivator is named but not dramatized on-page, so the pivot into action is slightly under-motivated. Closure beat is present and lens-consistent, but the price is external (ghosts freed) rather than internal, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tunnel atmosphere is economically seeded (“damp earth,” “rusted metal,” “spectral shadows”) and filtered through Mara’s explorer gaze. The beaded valve wheel earns micro-setting status: tactile specificity (“cool and smooth”) and later causal use. Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating bodies or impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure, mirroring escalation. Environment does not quite charge the final image (light burst is generic), so 9-bar gate not cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the swallowed truth”—is early and sustained. Escalation is linear discovery (noise → chamber → machine) rather than tightening trade-off; no option is foreclosed for Mara. Cost is borne by ghosts, not protagonist, so pressure feels observational. One meaningful intensification (whispers→screams) satisfies lens but lacks personal price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of skeptical child vs. believer father emerges through summary; no live ironic gap is staged. The ghost-shift concept literalizes his myth, producing a tidy reversal yet no lingering ambiguity. Final image recharges neither wheel nor tunnel; resonance is thematic rather than imagistic. Subtext stays flat—ghosts spell out their plea explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is generic thriller cadence rather than idiosyncratic interior voice. No dialogue to test naturalism. Syntax stays serviceable but templated (“air hung heavy,” “shadows twisted into shapes”). No purposeful elision or rhythmic pattern taught; voice neither obscures nor elevates clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; few filters or scaffold loops. Metaphors are familiar (“danced like spectral figures”) but not muddled. High info density early; some filler creeps in later (“the machine groaned to life, gears grinding as if awakening from a long slumber”). No artifact touches closure; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Haunted-industrial site is standard, but the father’s talk-radio psychic transcripts offer fresh data source—yet the story only summarizes them. Beaded valve wheel is a nice specific prop; its reanimation trope is conventional. Risk level is moderate; no structural experiment. Freshness capped because plot could transplant to any derelict site with minimal change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>“Reckless” is claimed, not shown—her cautious gait and obedient following contradict the label. She never jeopardizes safety or makes a rash choice that backfires. Label-only minus; late attempt to turn wheel feels pre-destined, not reckless.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Beaded valve wheel is early-seen, mid-used, and late-payoff: discovery → tactile beat → insertion that ends the shift. Its cool smoothness under fingers anchors one sensory beat; glow signals function. Removing it would break the entire release mechanism—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Factory ghost shift” is named early, materializes as whispers/machinery, and drives the climax. Concept shapes stakes (free trapped souls) and dictates the valve’s purpose. Could swap to mine collapse etc., but the industrial bead-wheel marriage is specific enough to stay high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Skepticism stated but never pressures her—she accepts supernatural signs without resistance or ironic friction. No scene where faith vs. doubt alters tactic; trait is ornamental. Missed crucible moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>“Appraise” translates to interpreting father’s radio rants; this back-story summary motivates entry but does not steer live choices. One climactic appraisal—wheel fits slot—yet linkage to earlier interpretation is implicit, not dramatized. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Talk-radio calls are expositional memory; mechanics absent (no taped voice, no dial-search). They spark her quest but play no role inside tunnel—could be letters. Late arrival and no mid-scene use caps score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Tunnel is atmospheric spine: constrains path, supplies echoing soundscape, houses machine. Spatial progression (glass → wall valve → cavern) guides beats. Could swap to mine, but sensory texture and valve marriage are tied to rail-industrial vernacular.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>“Hush after confession” is back-story trigger, not on-page ticking clock. Once inside tunnel, time is undifferentiated; no deadline or confession echo recurs. Only ornamental link to prompt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>“Weight of swallowed truth”动机 launches quest and returns as peace in final line; mid-scene no concrete weight metaphor dramatized. High closure linkage but low mid-pressure cost keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Drowsy alertness” appears only in opening clause; tone quickly flips to crisp thriller cadence. No sustained drowsy texture or waning vigilance. Early signal + final fatigue could have recharged image, but tone resets to generic horror alert.</comment>
