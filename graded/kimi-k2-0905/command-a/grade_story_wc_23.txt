<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-anchored drive is declared (“navigate the geography of loss”) but never embodied in contradictory impulse or tactile cost; she scavenges and welds without interior friction, and the arrival of refugees merely repeats the same beat. The censer foot dictates glow, not Mara’s values, so her final “sense of purpose” reads as retrospective label rather than earned renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—beacon shining, community growing—yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized (no forfeiture, no risk paid). Causal chain is thin: because the moon is full the device hums, because it hums wanderers arrive; Mara’s agency is limited to assembly, not choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Wind-scoured cliff, rusted walls, and moonlit bronze give tactile grit; the station’s ruined hydraulics could have constrained build tactics but remain backdrop. Micro-setting (censer foot in palm) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet spatial choreography never complicates action—tools and bodies stay loosely placed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes (“bring the lost home”) are declared early but never narrowed; each midnight call identical, no escalation of risk or resource scarcity. The single turning point—first traveler appears—occurs off Mara’s active decision, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration as elegy for irretrievable loss emerges through beacon-building, but theme is named more than dramatized (“geography of loss” repeated). Final image of cyclical moon and endless arrivals invites ambiguous reflection, yet subtext stays general—no specific memory or personal price is re-weighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mara; diction favors salt-stung consonants and spare rhythm that suits cliff-top isolation. Occasional template cadence (“the station… the patterns… the geography”) flattens voice, but perceptual signature—metal taste of bronze, wind shearing voice—remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; sentences advance without hedges. Density drops in mid-section where “she scavenged parts… the work was grueling… her hands raw” paraphrases the same beat three ways, sapping momentum just before the device awakens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lunar-synced relic guiding reversed avian-human migration fuses myth and cli-fi into fresh premise; patchwork engineer as pilgrim is memorable. Risk is moderate—mystic artifact plus midnight phone whisper risks cliché—but specificity of bronze foot’s patina and wind-battered station grounds the concept.</comment>
