<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s courier nerves and missing-mentor ache are shown through bodily cues (tightening satchel, visible breath) rather than labels, but the internal contradiction never sharpens into a micro-choice that costs her. The pendant’s “choice” does the decisive work; her agency is reactive, so the arc feels half-earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pendant’s final vibration reweights the world, giving Elara a new perceptual rhythm. Causality is soft—relics “choose” is asserted not demonstrated—but the pattern is taught early and the ending’s Charged Poise satisfies the lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ridgeway’s aurora is not backdrop but instrument: its light catches the pendant’s wings, guides her feet, and finally frames the scholar’s cottage, so environment directly charges the last image. Micro-setting succeeds; the body-as-setting (heartbeat syncing with relic) tightens the final beat. Specificity is selective, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender the relic that has rooted inside her?—is signaled when the pendant first hums. Pressure tightens once: handing it over severs the new sync, a palpable loss. Agency is again partial (the relic drives the turn), so the cost is felt but not fully self-authored; escalation meets the 600-word threshold yet lacks a second squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “wonder is not delivered but cultivated within.” The pendant’s germination inside the courier re-prices Alaric’s absent mentor trope: wisdom arrives posthumously through the body. No moralizing; final image of shared heartbeat offers non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—was she chosen or infected—without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is steady—she notices wind-chill, wing-glint, mentor-echoes. Syntax modulates with stress: short paratactic bursts at crest of ridge. No dialogue voice to judge; register remains within plausible courier diction. Filter verbs minimal; “seemed to shift” is earned uncertainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion. No loops or scaffold; “luminescent bands…living tapestry” is the only near-purple line but fits aurora scale. Information density high—satchel, pendant, mentor absence, fade boundary all seeded within first 120 words. Final line lands with image that reprises heartbeat motif without syntactic fanfare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar “relic chooses courier” arc is refreshed by treating the courier body as cultivation soil; heartbeat-sync turns trope visceral. Scholar’s cottage at memory-myth boundary is understated world-building that feels discovered, not diagrammed. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot reversals—but coherence justifies the gamble.</comment>
