<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s illustrator vocation is named but never weaponised; no drawing choice alters the plot. Interiority drifts into abstract “wave of understanding” rather than embodied contradiction. The final sketch is asserted, not dramatised, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant quiets, she sketches under stars, cadence restored—cost is the inability to keep the Heart. Causality is soft: the canal reshapes itself “as if” obeying her, not because of a rule we were taught. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: the repeated infinity pulses tighten texture until the final image reweights time as tapestry, not river.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canal, slick ledge, and glowing gate provide tactile anchors; the pool’s mirror-still surface charges the final image. Selective sensory triage—visual, kinaesthetic, thermal—keeps momentum. Micro-setting (pendant against sternum) constrains the step onto the ledge, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“find the Heart before the giant’s nap ends”—are declared early but never tracked; no ticking cue narrows options. Escalation is textural: pendant warms, canals bend, gate opens—each intensifies atmosphere rather than risk. The only cost is leaving the Heart, but that forfeiture is abstract, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—time as woven tapestry, not possession—emerges cleanly through the pool revelation and final sketch. Avoids moralising; the infinity motif’s shift from key to quiet keepsake reweights meaning. Subtext could be sharper: grandmother’s echo is named, not dramatised, so emotional aftereffect is moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: illustrator’s eye for rhythm, temperature, and line. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments on the ledge—without drumbeat. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, largely loop-free; occasional soft fillers (“as if it were urging her forward”) slightly dilute causality. Metaphors stay coherent: canal serpent, tapestry thread. No scaffold clusters or mixed vehicles in the closure beat; momentum breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Infinity pendant as portable loom for borrowed time feels fresh; canal-as-labyrinth rooftop system supplies inventive vertical geography. Legends are familiar, yet the illustrator’s gaze textures them with line-and-shade specificity. Risk is moderate: concept could push further if her art actually rewove the canal rather than merely inspiring her.</comment>
