<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority stays lyric and embodied; her trembling hand and rooted feet externalize the exile’s cost. The contradiction—yearning to fledge yet standing still—runs through every micro-choice until the sentinel’s arrival crystallizes her refusal. No secondary crucible on page, so relationship bullet waived; the self-as-crucible is credible. Motive progression is clear, but the absence of a visible flaw that could compound keeps her just shy of the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of gaps, dust, starlight builds density toward the arm-offering image. Anchors who/where/when secured by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sentinel pausing plus verse glowing reweights options with undeniable social cost. Cost is conceptual but legible in the sentinel’s retreat and garden’s exhale; persistent constraint (ban) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garden’s midnight-silver petals function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and hides the ink ritual; tool (moonstone dust) and body (bare feet anchored) complete the triad. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the selective lens (glow, dew, obsidian) mirrors internal state without cataloging. Spatial choreography holds: vial → palm → forearm → sentinel edge remains trackable. Environment supplies both resource (ink) and risk (exposure), charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defiance of erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: dust glow intensifies, footfalls trace constellations, garden blooms brighter under tension. Single meaningful tightening when sentinel appears; live option (flee) is foreclosed by her straight-spine stance with visible social cost. No swappability; the verse-on-skin act is inseparable from the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through concrete ritual, not assertion; the cosmic verse is the thesis made flesh. Subtext operates in sentinel’s pause—silence acknowledges the verse’s power. No moralizing line; final “fledge” whispered by petals supplies non-literal answer. Some abstraction in “cosmic verse” phrasing slightly dilutes specificity, holding it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via “shadows stretched like whispers,” paid off in star-drunk cadence of final spin. Perceptual signature filters cosmos through dancer’s kinesthetic sense—constellations underfoot, tide memory in hips. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on narration alone; diction stays within dancer’s sensorium. Minor template cadence in “her feet…her body…her gaze” triplet, but rhythm serves mounting pulse, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned and payoff-bearing (dust = galaxy, petals = pages). No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Two paraphrase loops (“glow intensifying with every heartbeat” echoes “glowing faintly”) and one filter verb stack (“seemed to exhale”) keep it from 8+. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into final spin, then cuts to sentinel halt—effective breath control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia (memory ban) is retooled through dancer’s kinesthetic ink ritual—fresh corporeal angle. Moonstone dust as forbidden pigment plus gap-observation method feel specific to this voice, not checklist quirks. Risk taken in lyric escalation rather than overt confrontation; coherence maintained. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic rebel—tide memory and garden obsidian are integral.</comment>
