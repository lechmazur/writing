<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s curiosity is credibly anchored to her occupation and prior hunger for “forbidden knowledge,” but the interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“simply complicated,” “nonlinear inheritance”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under pressure; the single micro-choice—clutching the cameo—does re-weight her stance, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized. Secondary keeper figure functions only as exposition mouthpiece, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, motives stay consistent and the closing resolve feels earned within the lyric-situational design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cameo re-weights Elara’s mission from cataloguing to “unravelling,” with conceptual cost—she now shoulders an unending, nonlinear legacy. Causality is situational rather than sequential; orchard and keeper pressure crystallizes her stance, satisfying the lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is cleanly taught within 120 words. No artifact obscures the final image, but the keeper’s late entrance and instant exposition is a soft coincidence that slightly blunts the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Astral orchard is rendered through starlight petals, whisper gravity, and mirrored bathroom—each detail constrains Elara’s movement and attention. The cameo itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensorium (hum resonating in ribs, faint warmth in palm) stays tied to POV priorities. Spatial choreography is ghost-light but tracked; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to nonlinear knowledge—signals early; escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern of mirrored reflections and keeper encounter deepen the cost of pursuing the orchard’s secrets rather than narrow external options. One visible price: Elara forfeits her prior detached-cataloguer identity—cost is legible in the final “brightened disquiet.” No reversal, but a meaningful stance crystallization fits situational lens. Pressure stays coherent, though low-tempo lyric mode keeps tension more medial than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges via imagery (shifting cameo patterns, mirrored thoughts) rather than explicit thesis—no moralizing tagline. Final image re-prices the orchard from workplace to destiny, inviting post-text reflection on knowledge-as-web. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether legacy is gift or burden. Insight feels earned because tied to Elara’s sensory handling of cameo and mirrors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“iridescent petals,” “brightened disquiet”) stays inside Elara’s educated-aesthetic lexicon. Perceptual signature—attention to shimmer, breath-hum, mirror-fragments—is distinct and sustained. No dialogue to test spoken idiom, but internal cadence modulates: shorter sentences at revelation beat. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective (“captured starlight”) and paid off in closure image. Minor scaffold: consecutive abstract nouns (“beautiful, inexplicable, and unsettling”) could compress, but do not dull final line. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; prop tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses astral botany + heirloom pistachio shell—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. “Philosophical breakthrough in bathroom of mirrors” is risky yet becomes integral to thematic re-pricing, not gimmick. Inevitability test: only this micro-setting could mirror nonlinear memory so literally. Risk heightens meaning without breaking coherence, meriting bonus +0.3.</comment>
