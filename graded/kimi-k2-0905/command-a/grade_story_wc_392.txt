<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is serviceably concrete—her fingers trace the journal, her pulse quickens—but “fortified vulnerability” is asserted more than dramatized. The mentor is never on-stage, so the emotional crucible is one-sided; we see her decide to break free, yet the cost is declared (“she felt free”) rather than paid in a beat we witness. Still, micro-choices (angling the lantern, prying the wall, steadying her hand) align with her occupational lens and keep her from sliding into stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: drought-scented tunnel → fissure → hidden compartment → journal → mentor photo → renunciation. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the dawn hit on the grate re-weights all prior tunnel imagery and confirms her rupture from the mentor. Cost is present—the mentor’s betrayal is now irreversible and her career path is altered—but because the mentor is off-page the price feels social rather than visceral. Orientation is secured within 70 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern recurs twice with escalating charge (light flickers at discovery, brightens at exit), satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that constrains final image. Tunnel geography is tracked cleanly—footfalls, fissure, false wall, chamber—and the drought aftermath is evoked through rust scent and damp earth without checklist excess. Spatial choreography survives the single-scene constraint; no impossible object jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“break free from mentor control”—is signaled early and tightened when the photograph implicates him. Agency resides in attention and endurance rather than external combat; she keeps descending while knowledge narrows her options. Escalation is knowledge-driven under Causal lens; no redundant reversals, but also no tangible resource lost on-page, so cost is conceptual not visceral. Meets the single meaningful tightening threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of inherited complicity vs. individual conscience emerges through the journal warning and the mentor’s photograph—never stated outright. The lantern’s final brightening re-weights earlier Underground Railroad allusion into a personal liberation trope, giving quiet resonance. Avoids moralizing, but the emotional aftereffect is muted because the mentor remains an abstraction; complexity is hinted, not fully plumbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds without leakage; diction stays within Elara’s forensic perceptual register (“angle of the marks,” “residue of metal”). Lantern flicker as rhythmic refrain is purposeful rather than algorithmic. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough for the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences open variedly, no paraphrase loops detected. Sensory nouns are concrete (“rust and damp earth”) and verbs strong (“echoed,” “flickered,” “trace”). One metaphor (“shadows seemed to reverberate”) is near-cliché but rescued by the sonic echo motif that pays off at the end. No artifacts touch closure; rhythm accelerates naturally into the final dawn image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Takes the familiar “investigator uncovers mentor corruption” arc but roots it in an infrastructural-collapse context and an Underground-railroad lantern, giving fresh historical strata. The journal-as-warning device is standard, yet the pairing of drought-aftermath scent with tunnel entombed secrets feels specific. No famous-scene echoes; premise is recognizable but adequately inflected through forensic detail and spatial descent.</comment>
