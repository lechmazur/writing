<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer’s interiority is lyric but generic—“cautious exuberance,” “fear and hope”—never particularized through bodily contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. She remains a receptive vessel for symbols (watch, humming shelves) rather than an agent whose flaws or hierarchies of value force costly trade-offs. The blank-watch warmth and the quill-automatic writing are magical givens; they reveal no internal limits or blind spots that complicate her path. Closure is a beatific smile, not an earned renunciation, so the arc feels bestowed, not bled for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambient causality holds: because the watch hums, therefore she follows, therefore she writes—each step tightening the library’s claim on her. The archway’s time-reversed glyphs teach the Accumulative pattern early; the final backward tick re-weights the premise with conceptual cost (she is now conduit, not seeker). Orientation is secured by line 5 (“edge of the mist”), well inside the 120-word window. The only slack is the off-page stranger who gave the watch—an unmotivated seed that never loops back—so the lens stays intact but not immaculate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing library is rendered through kinetic sense—electric parchment tang, shelves that pulse and shift—so space breathes with immediacy rather than backdrop tourism. Micro-setting works: the watch’s warmth and the desk’s golden pool physically anchor her choices; the mist curtain parts only when she commits to entry. Spatial choreography is flawless: distance tracked from arch to desk to exit without drift. The environment does not merely mood-board; it supplies the cipher’s propagation medium, charging the final image when the parchment itself begins to glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the unspoken word that explains her summoning—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens when the library demands transcription. Escalation is textural: each shelf thickens the cipher’s hum, narrowing her options to listen or be overwhelmed. Agency is present—she writes—but the cost is symbolic (she becomes “conduit”) rather than viscerally felt; no credible loss of time, identity, or safety lands on the page. The tightening is coherent under Accumulative lens, yet the price remains abstract, capping entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: voiced words colonize reality, unvoiced ones gestate in misty latency—a concept re-priced when the parchment, not the library, becomes the glowing survivor. No character moralizes; the idea accretes through image (shifting glyphs, backward clock). The final smile crystallizes Charged Poise: she carries living language back into a world that may not want it. Ambiguity lingers—conduit or Typhoid Mary—without tidy thesis, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric is stable, no head-hop. Perceptual signature is mist-and-light obsessed, filtering every observation through hush, glow, hum; diction stays inside that register. Rhythm swells with propagation cadence—“each shelf she passed added a layer”—then tightens into single-clause final exit, mirroring urgency. No dialogue to distort voice; only the symbolic writing intrudes, and it is appropriately alien (shifting glyphs), not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is spare yet textured—“tang of electricity,” “curled as if waiting”—without modifier glut. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or hum-code. Figurative control holds: reversed time trope stays consistent from arch to watch to quill. One near-scaffold—“she had to document what she found” right after the desk is revealed—could compress, but it does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “library of unspoken words” could feel stock, yet the propagation-delay cipher and living parchment transform it into an organic data-spore ecology rather than sentimental attic. The blank-faced confidence-man watch is a fresh inversion: timepiece that refuses to tell time, instead recruiting its bearer into linguistic midwifery. Risk is taken—no antagonist, no blood cost—trusting lyric accretion to carry stakes; the gamble mostly pays off. Specificity of sensory code keeps the concept from sliding into abstract allegory.</comment>
