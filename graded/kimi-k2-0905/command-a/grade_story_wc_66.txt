<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is thinly dramatized—her “surge of excitement” is label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The notebook grab is the sole micro-choice; it advances the beat but carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. No contradictory impulses run in scene; motivation stays at abstract desire level. Closure is a declared resolve, not an earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the glow-spread and lyric fragments intensify atmosphere rather than cause-and-effect. Closure is a Charged Poise—Clara’s stance crystallizes—but the cost is only implied (“quiet determination”). Orientation anchors by line 3, but the pirate signal’s origin and agency remain opaque, blurring causality. One meaningful tightening—the song slows for her pen—works texturally, not tactically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“Ember alcove in mist” functions as micro-setting: the glowing radio dial literally charges the final image and constrains transcription tempo. Sensory hierarchy obeys Clara’s copyist eye—parchment, ink, dial light—integrated into action. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift in prop states. Weather (mist) mirrors internal veil but stops short of altering choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost stories—is declared early but never tested on-page; no tangible resource is risked. Pressure is atmospheric (glow spreads, song fades) rather than tactical; the song slows as courtesy, not cost. No reversal narrows options; escalation is a mood gradient. Closure reconfigures stance, yet the absence of felt price keeps tension conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—resurrection of narrative via ephemera—emerges through dust, radio hiss, and ink, avoiding direct statement. Subtext rests in the radio’s “secret luminosity” as metaphor for clandestine memory. Final image of notebook closed at dawn offers quiet repricing of silence vs story. Avoids moralizing, but thematic complexity is limited by single emotional register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature tilts toward sound and parchment texture, apt for a copyist. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “glow” and “mist” to create cadence. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within Clara’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulates slightly under peak reception—shorter clauses mimic breath-catching—then re-settles.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. High information density in opening 120 words anchors who-where-when without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“the song seemed to know… seemed to cloak itself”) costs −0.2. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands with image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise—“teach dust to tell stories” via pirate radio in a post-narrative famine—is fresh, but execution drifts toward quiet vignette rather than risk. Pirate broadcast functions more as mood device than tactical twist. Glow-radio as memory conduit offers small inflection. Transformation test fails: swap “dust” to “ashes” and arc still holds, indicating surface novelty.</comment>
