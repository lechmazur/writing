<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is sensuous—tracing the stencil, smelling phantom blooms—yet her grief never hardens into contradictory micro-choices that cost her anything; the tattoo moment is receptive, not decisive. The “seed” pendant arrives too late to test her hierarchy of values on the page, so the arc feels like gentle acceptance rather than earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the vine projected on the walls reframes her ritual craft into living botany, the cost is the irreversible mark on her skin that forecloses permanent widow stasis. Causality is light-driven rather than strict because/therefore, but the accumulative pattern holds; however, the origami coordinate chain is set up more than it is paid off, a mild telegraphing debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Observatory glass, brass telescope, and vellum stencil are knotted to her attention and choices; the telescope becomes the literal pivot on which she steadies herself for the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is good—star-filtered light, silver dust, scent of blooms—though “curtains of intention” remain conceptually fuzzy and never acquire tactile resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she graft his science of decay onto her own life?—tightens when the curtains illuminate and the stencil activates; the price is the permanent tattoo that commits her to public, bodily synthesis of botany and jewelry. One meaningful escalation suffices, but the origami coordinates function more as mood than active pressure, so the tightening is present yet soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience is not denial of decay but the decision to wear it. The vine’s movement from paper to wall to skin reweights “teach withering to bloom” from metaphor to flesh without a concluding sermon. Subtext resides in silence—she never speaks her husband’s name—creating lingering ambiguity about whether she is healing or merely beautifying grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s body and tools; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices patina, fold lines, starlight temperature. Syntax modulates: longer, leaf-like sentences during reflection, clipped fragments at illumination burst. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil; register never drifts into academic distancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: “shaping silver into delicate mourning bands” does world, occupation, and mood in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting at “curtains of intention shimmered faintly, as if charged with energy” where “as if” softens an otherwise declarative marvel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Combining grieving jeweller, astronomical filter-light, and botanical tattoo is an unexpected triangulation that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative mood, not hard SF—but the piece commits fully. Deduction for faint echo of ubiquitous “origami clues” trope; still, the coordinate linkage to decay sites gives it specific memorial logic.</comment>
