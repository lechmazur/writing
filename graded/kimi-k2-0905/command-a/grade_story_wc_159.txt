<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic—no contradictory impulses collide on the page; the single moment of “trembling” is performed, not embodied. Her decision to sing is declared, not wrestled with; cost is poetic (“heart heavy”) rather than tactile. The caretaker role remains label-deep—no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Closure is gentle stasis, but because no prior flaw or hunger is dramatized, the renunciation feels pre-ordained, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is loose: “felt a pull” is the only trigger for the entire quest; no intermediate because/therefore links escalate risk. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the museum threshold appears as a teleport rather than a consequence. Closure is Charged Poise (light bloom, names etched deeper) and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the cost is abstract—no persistent constraint shapes future action. The shattering chime is pretty but functions as symbol, not causal price.</comment>

<comment> milky-blue walls and glass petals are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze. The Vessel of Echoes and cracked bamboo tube act as micro-settings that constrain the final ritual—she must cradle one, release the other. Spatial choreography inside the museum is lightly sketched but sufficient for a lone actor. Cloud-density shift nicely mirrors internal thinning of breath, anchoring stakes in body.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is signaled early; pressure stays single-track. One meaningful tightening: the chime shatters, forcing the song to finish without its original instrument; this narrows option from repair to pure voice. Cost is aesthetic (broken relic) not visceral; no reversible loss alters later tactics. Escalation is mood-intensification rather than consequence-chain, fitting Accumulative lens but capping tension at moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as moral duty—emerges through image pattern (glass, echo, bloom) rather than statement. Subtext is thin: no silence or gesture conveys what speech withholds. Final image reweights the premise: names now glow, so extinction is postponed, not solved—nice ambiguity. Yet thematic cost is collective, not personal, blunting emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment> Third-person lyric voice sustains a hush-pulse rhythm that matches cloud-soft setting. Syntax favors repetition of soft consonants and floating participles, creating a lullaby cadence; no drum-beat monotony. Diction stays within Elara’s contemplative lexicon—no academic register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noticed detail is either glass or sound, reinforcing her occupational filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but three successive “as” clauses in the climax dilute immediacy. Figurative language is dense throughout—almost every sentence carries a metaphor; the pattern is not taught, so it feels decorative rather than structural. No synonym loops or scaffolding, but “light bloomed / light intensified / light faded” is a soft paraphrase chain. Closure image is clear, but the preceding pile-up of ethereal conceits blunts its edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Museum of extinct feelings is fresh world-building, turning emotion into curatable artifact. Wind chime as memory engine gives a new slant on the old “sing the dead to life” trope. Conceptual risk—lyric accretive plot without antagonist—mostly pays off because closure lands. Could swap opal library for crystal cathedral with minor edits, so specificity is moderate, not inseparable.</comment>
