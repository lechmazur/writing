<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific and anchored in bodily tension (“her knuckles whitening”); contradictory impulses appear in the hesitation-calibration sequence. Final lever choice feels earned, but “icy warmth” is asserted rather than embodied in the moment of cost; emotional state drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once. Competence balanced with visible risk; no secondary pressure from another character, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each calibration step triggers the next system failure. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure unit is a Charged Poise—the nexus stabilizes but future danger is now legible, with the price of possible “rewriting physics” stated on the page. Constraint (destabilized station) shapes tactics throughout; persistent cost is the station-wide damage logged before reboot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metallic scar, twilight sky, and magnetic nexus are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s mechanic eye; wing-creature luminescence mirrors rising/falling tension. Micro-setting (nexus) constrains every tactical move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography tight; no geography drift. Weather/environment limited to twilight and creature glow, but both serve tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove time moves sideways”—is signaled early and escalates through each calibration failure. One meaningful tightening: overload spreads station-wide, foreclosing safe retreat. Price (system failures, logged anomaly) is visible on page. Agency remains hers; coincidence does not resolve. Could use sharper on-page trade-off beat mid-escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of scientific obsession versus responsibility emerges through system-failure imagery; no overt thesis. Final soft hum of nexus reweights prior triumph with lingering threat, achieving quiet resonance. “Icy warmth” motif threaded but not yet fully repriced at closure—more hinted than crystallized. Avoids final moralizing; ambiguity remains productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is mechanic-technical (“magnetic nexus, pulsed mechanically warm”) without drifting into academic overload. Rhythm accelerates under stress via shorter beat clusters; no filter-verb stacks. Voice coherence intact; no dialogue to judge. Minor over-reliance on compound adjectives (“mechanically warm glow,” “icy warmth”) but pattern consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often fuse tool-action with emotional valence (“tightened a bolt…purpose tied to her deepest motivation”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors disciplined. Occasional modifier repetition (“glow, glowing, luminescence”) but spaced enough to avoid drumbeat. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraphs cut cleanly. Closure sentence free of prose clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sideways-time premise gives fresh twist to lone-technician trope; integration with alien station and mechanic POV feels specific. Wing-creature backdrop adds lyrical texture but remains decorative rather than rule-changing. “Mechanically warm” as descriptor is memorable micro-innovation. Could risk more by letting alien biology intersect the time anomaly; concept stays inwardly focused.</comment>
