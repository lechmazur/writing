<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning for “the shape of home” is anchored in concrete sensory memory (feather) and drives the entire arc; the interior contradiction—needing to remember yet fearing pain—lives on the page. However, her choices remain largely receptive (touching stone, letting symbols appear) rather than irreversible; the final “step forward” is symbolic, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The buried-talent motif is voiced, not dramatized through risky action. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent, and the emotional progression feels irrational yet credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bookstore circle and floating stone reweight “home” from place to portable state of being, with felt emotional cost in the storm-release. Causality is light—stone’s glow is magical rather than earned—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery (feather/stone/mercury-glass) accretes to shift meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 3. The ending beat is legible and charged, satisfying the 9− gate even though agency is mostly interpretive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is sketched with selective, POV-filtered detail—groaning shelves, stained-glass light—functioning as a mind-maze that externalizes memory. Micro-setting of the circular clearing at the end literally reconfigures space in tandem with the interior shift, passing the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors shifting light and touch, mirroring Elara’s mercury-glass fluidity. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early; pressure escalates through pattern deepening (symbol glow, corridor shift) rather than narrowing options. The storm works as Accumulative intensifier, but no tangible resource is risked or lost; the cost is emotional release, not foreclosed option. The single meaningful tightening is the moment stone floats and language returns; it reweights identity but does not test Elara with a trade-off. Agency is contemplative, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: home as internal harmony, not geography. The feather-stone-bridge of memory refuses moralizing; meaning accrues through image-return rather than assertion. Final image of “quiet strength” offers Charged Poise without platitude. Ambiguity lingers—will the rebuilt self survive outside the mountain?—inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited glides with Elara’s fluid perception; diction (“groaning shelves,” “symbols seemed to shift”) stays within her mystic lexicon. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during glow-surge, mirroring emotional tempo. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; perceptual signature is consistent. Minor filter-verb slips (“seemed to pulse”) but rhythm remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful sentence variety; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative density spikes only once at climax (“storm within her broke”) and is earned. Occasional elevated diction (“labyrinthine,” “conceptual repricing”) fits seer persona but borders on registry drift; clarity intact. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, no buried leads.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mystic bibliophilia with buried-language stone feels fresh, yet “memory-object unlocks self” is a known contour. Specificity of mountain bookstore and mercury-glass seer individuates the trope. Risk is moderate—lyric interior, magic stone—but execution commits fully, no hedging. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without feather conduit and bookstore topology.</comment>
