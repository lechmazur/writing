<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his “mind worked like the gears of the floodgates”—and his micro-choice to sketch the compromise in the dust is embodied. Yet the contradictory impulses promised in the prompt (“slyly heartfelt”) never collide in a single beat; the poem-chain delivers a ready-made ethos instead of forcing him to improvise under pressure. Cost is asserted, not dramatized: we are told the village and scholars both accept, but Elias pays no visible price for his decryption. The result is a competent arc that never quite becomes a crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: adhesive analysis → poem-chain → floodgate blueprint → compromise. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis—Elias “had trembled, but he had not broken”—with social cost legible in the village’s sigh and scholars’ nod. Orientation is clean by word 80; the volcano’s breathing is taught early and pays off in the final cadence. One paraphrase loop (“closer to the heart…closer to the truth”) keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s stone “expanding and contracting as if alive” is used to cue Elias’s pacing and synchronize with his pulse, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint. Sensory hierarchy stays locked to his machinist gaze—brass links, damp stone, fissure light—never sliding into tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: chain uncoils, steps measured, dust-sketch centered. The volcano never quite threatens action, so the setting charges the image more than it narrows战术 options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent eruption of cultural conflict, not lava—is signaled early and tightens once when the poem’s last line reweights his task into a sacrifice metaphor. Because the actual cost is social consensus rather than a tangible loss (tool, status, time), the pressure feels conceptual, not visceral. Agency is present—he sketches the design—but the turn is micro, not reversal. Sufficient for 7-band entry but short of the visible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poem-chain’s refrain: “to give is to gain, to break is to mend.” No character sermonizes; the encrypted compassion stays literal in the blueprint’s dual-use valves. The final image—cracks as “beauty in imperfection”—offers a quiet CR that reframes the earlier dread. Complexity is honored: villagers’ fear is legitimized, scholars’ greed unchecked, compromise provisional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The perceptual signature is steady machinist—precise metaphors of gears, chains, floodgates—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for contemplation, fragments (“He understood.”) for crystallization. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. One template cadence run (“closer to…closer to…”) is the single bar to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: brass links glinting double as poetic cipher and spatial guide. Metaphors remain consistent—volcano as lungs, chain as lifeline—with no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loop noted above costs −0.3; otherwise scaffolding is minimal. The final line (“He had trembled, but he had not broken”) lands with crisp percussive echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The floodgate-compromise conceit freshens the stale “scholars vs townsfolk” trope, and the antique chain-as-poem is a specific invention rather than stock prop. Transformation test passes: swap volcano for cave or chain for map and the emotional math collapses. Risk level is moderate—lyric escalation inside dormant volcano—executed competently, not radically. Lacks an unforgettable inflection to push 8+.</comment>
