<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her dusk fixation and talismanic stone ground her—but the climactic “luminous regret” is named, not embodied, and the renunciation (leaving the stone) lacks a preceding micro-choice that shows cost. Still, her obsession drives every beat, and the final stance crystallizes under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow’s transformation into sculpture reweights the premise, felt cost legible in “luminous regret.” Causal chain holds—footage comparison → vial discovery → metamorphose—though the 40% mark could anchor the vial’s rule sooner. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of glowing objects escalates density to the charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Library-above-clouds is atmospherically rich, but the micro-setting that matters is the murky vial: its difference from glowing jars constrains Elara’s search and charges the final sculpture. Sensory selection stays biased to her dusk POV; spatial track clean. The vial’s tactile coldness and weight could have been exploited one beat earlier to hit 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving form to forgotten dreams—tightens once when Elara presses stone to vial, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (she shoulders collective sorrow), but the price isn’t felt in body or resource; hence withheld from 8.8+. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: each glowing object intensifies pattern until murky vial breaks it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relationship between forgetting and form; the sculpture is the non-literal answer to “what shape does hope take?” No moralizing—final image lets regret and hope coexist. Subtext carried by shifting light imagery rather than assertion; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s dusk-filtered perception; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens with twilight cadence, compresses during vial beat. “Softly deliberate” diction mirrors her trait without self-labeling. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; perceptual signature strong enough to carry lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “a world she rarely visited anymore” echoes “world below the clouds” in adjacent sentences—minor −0.2. Strong nouns/verbs (“shimmered like captured sunsets,” “sky melted”) avoid purple. Closure line varies cadence effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating library + shareable dream vials is fresh synthesis; shadow-as-forgotten-possibility repurposes glitch trope into emotional artifact. Risk-taking modest—structure defaults to single shard. Specificity of “dusk noticer” profession gives memorable tilt; could push further if vial mechanic had stranger logic.</comment>
