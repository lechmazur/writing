<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “wanting to store wonder for dull days” is dramatized in the quiet moment when he cups invisible echoes—an embodied micro-choice that costs him sleep and companionship. Interiority stays particular to a tinkerer: angles, gears, peripheral glints. The arc is endurance rather than swing; the renunciation of normal time is implicit, but the text hedges on the cellar’s price, shaving the top.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal spine: broken timer → angle study → dusk alignment → hum of harvest. The decisive change is on the page: the cavern fills with audible echoes, reweighting Elias’s reality. Orientation by 120 words is clear and concrete; the ending’s cost is felt (“fragile, like the first snowflake”) yet Elias’s future path stays implicit—cost is more atmospheric than specific, holding short of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble walls, silver veins and reflected dusk angles are returned to in every beat, guiding hand-placement and emotional register; the cavern itself becomes the tool that constrains the repair. Sensory hierarchy is locksmith-centric: gleam, click, hum dominate; temperature and smell are rationed. Space stays coherent in single-scene crouch; no geography drift. At closure the living marble “breathes,” charging the final image—meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture ephemeral wonder before the world dulls”—is anchored early. One meaningful tightening: only at dusk-angle do gears sync, narrowing the option window. The price (days without sleep, bodily wear) is gestured but not specified enough to hit 8.8+. Escalation is steady under causal lens; no false reversals, but the harvest itself feels more wondrous than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes in the final sensory image: wonder is tangible yet melting, stored at the price of permanent solitary vigil. “Cellar of reason” risks thematic echo, but it’s saved by being enacted (he literally descends into the cavern’s belly earlier). No explicit moralizing; resonance emerges from light/echo motifs shifting from intellectual puzzle to fragile warmth—earned complexity without tidy answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elias’s tactile, angle-obsessed perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“peripherally focused,” gear-hum rhythm). Syntax mirrors tinkering—short clauses for clicks, longer spirals for reflections. No dialogue to distort voice; free-indirect hum runs clean. Register stays within a self-taught artisan’s lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the breakthrough dusk beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence length modulates with tension; only two scaffold loops (“reflected...reflection” in adjacent lines) briefly dull momentum but are outside the closure beat. Metaphors are coherent—echo as snowflake, marble breathing—anchored in physical logic. High density: each sentence advances image, angle, or internal state. No typo or pronoun drift. Final line resolves by image, satisfying cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Harvest of echoes via broken timer” is fresh synthesis; trope of capturing lost time is inverted through a peripheral-vision craftsman rather than mage. Specificity—angle mathematics, marble acoustics—makes concept memorable. Risk resides in lyric stillness, not twist, and pays off in atmospheric closure. Could edge higher if causal rules of storage were more explicit, but piece commits to quiet magic without flinching.</comment>
