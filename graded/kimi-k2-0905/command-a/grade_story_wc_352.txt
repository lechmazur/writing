<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“prism-minded” kept active through perceptual skips), but the only genuine choice—step into the pool—comes late and is unpunanced; still, the kinesthetic handling of manuscript and seed shows bodily stakes, and the latent-flaze motivation stays consistent to the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: crystal descent + opened compartment = tangible Decisive Change with conceptual cost (“responsibility” made visible via glowing seed). Causal chain holds: doodle → inversion hour → seed. One minor scaffold loop (“luminescent veins” twice) and Orientation Test waived because disorientation pays off; lens stays situational/accumulative to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto is not postcard filler: serpentine walls guide turns, mist thickens breath-logic, inverted gravity re-maps spatial agency; the manuscript and crystal act as micro-setting that constraint choices and literally charge the final pedestal moment, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock forgotten combinations—tightens once: doodle re-patterning under inversion forecloses mis-reading and makes seed accessible. Cost is visible (year-long wait, gravity fall, seed responsibility). Single meaningful turn suffices for this length; agency is decision-to-enter and alignment act, not violent reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodial knowledge emerges organically from plot machinery; no moralizing summary. “Seeds of vigilance” re-weights from abstract concept to literal object-to-protect, giving Conceptual Repricing resonance. Minor deduction for thematic echo phrase “latent blaze” reused in closing clause.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays inside Elara’s prism-filter; perceptual signature (“kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge”) governs syntax and image choice. No head-hop; lyric compressions (“world tilted”) are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses at inversion, longer cadence at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, concrete nouns, no filler adverbs; information density high. One paraphrase loop on “luminescent veins” and a mixed metaphor (“earth held its breath” beside “veins”) keep it from 8-band; no artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar “secret chamber at magic hour” scaffold is refreshed by gravity inversion as physical threshold, prism-minded cognition as non-omniscient key, and seed-to-carry epilogue. Synthesis feels particular to this voice; without Elara’s perceptual filter the quest would collapse, passing transformation test.</comment>
