<comment>Elara’s insomniac-painter vocation seeds her restless seeing, but her interiority drifts into generic “search for meaning” rather than a concrete want that tightens choices; the brooch-triggered shift to “keeper of stories” is declared, not dramatized through a visible cost or irreversible renunciation. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; she simply receives the book and paints. The earned-stasis closure is present yet under-pressured because the stakes never narrow to a fork where she could lose something.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: rain-trail → ruin → brooch → map → cove → exchange holds without breaks; orientation is clear by ~100 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she paints, now weighted as “bridge between worlds,” with conceptual cost legible. Escalation is single-cycle; no tightening fork or visible forfeiture keeps it from 9-band. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Island geography is sketched sparsely but functionally: tidal cove, ruin, cottage edge—each serves as access point for next beat. Salt-damp air, bioluminescent algae, and seaweed cloak ground the world in sensory bias of a painter’s eye. The amber brooch re-appears at desk in closing image, charging the final canvas with prior heat—meets 9+ gate. No spatial drift or white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from chaos”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource or identity is risked. Pressure rises only once: the exchange moment, where she relinquishes the brooch for the book, yet this trade costs her nothing we can feel. Agency is present but low-temperature; escalation is a single smooth stair, not a fork that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as living archive emerges organically through the island-as-manuscript metaphor and the final image of painting as translation; no overt thesis is stated. Subtext operates in the shift from insomnia-driven copying to voluntary transcription—an earned micro-wisdom. The brooch-to-book handoff reweights “exchange” from commodity to narrative, providing a resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the concept edges close to prompt-echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains painterly perceptual signature: rain trails as composition, horizon shimmer as palette. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within Elara’s intellectual reach; no register drift. Single POV; no head-hopping. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold (“her mind buzzing with questions”) and a single mixed metaphor (“tapestry of parched lands and reclaimed seas”) slightly dull the opening. Information density is high; each paragraph advances discovery. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal island as living archive is a fresh synthesis; the rain-trail map and geometry-defying ruin avoid generic post-apocalypse tropes. The exchange motif is overt but transformed from mercantile to narrative barter. Specificity of amber warmth reappearing in the final desk image gives the concept a memorable tactile hook. Could push further into ecological strangeness, but risk-taking is present and coherent.</comment>
