<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary truthfulness is stated, not dramatized; we never see her forced to blurt a costly truth. The “preserve wonder” motive is declared in exposition and never tested by a moment where lying would save her skin. Internal contradiction is missing: she never wrestles with wanting to lie but being unable. The final choice to “whisper the riddle” is gentle but not visibly costly—no one hears, nothing changes, so the arc feels under-punctured.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: box → key → staircase → orb → vision → surface revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s blackout is re-framed as protective sacrifice, felt cost is the drones’ death and Elara’s new burden of truth. One soft spot: the orb’s “danger too immense” is told, not foreshadowed, so the reprice feels slightly retroactive rather than seeded. Still, the lens holds (Causal) and the final image reweights premise with undeniable social cost—she must speak, and the city may not thank her.</comment>

<comment>“Nectar dusk” and “lacquer box” give tactile specificity; the tower’s dormant hum is a nice micro-pressure. Spatial choreography is flawless: stool → pile → hidden panel → spiral → pedestal, each step tracks. Sensory hierarchy narrows to cold, glow, hum under crisis, matching Elara’s narrowed attention. The orb as micro-setting charges the final image—its blue pulse is the literal new light dawning—meeting the 9+ gate; only brevity keeps it just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus safety—arrives late (riddle line 6) but sticks. One meaningful tightening: touching the orb forces irreversible knowledge, foreclosing ignorance. Cost is conceptual (lifelong burden of truth) rather than visceral; no concrete loss (friendship, job, blood) is shown on-page. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal, so escalation plateau hovers at “strong” rather than “exceptional.”</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder preserved through painful truth—emerges via orb vision rather than sermon. The drones’ sacrificial logic complicates a simple “truth is good” moral, offering plausible counter-reading: maybe ignorance was bliss. Final whisper avoids explicit thesis; image of tower re-humming under amber dawn lets reader feel reprice. One dab of thematic echo: “wonder in routine” is repeated phrasing near start and end, but it’s brief enough to escape penalty.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: shifting box patterns, cold air, hum. Diction is controlled, slightly elevated (“etched,” “lacquer,” “sentinel”) but consistent with a toll keeper who names machinery. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived. One micro-template: “the box was...” repeated sentence stem early, but it’s isolated and doesn’t blunt momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies: short beat “With a deep breath, she descended,” against longer, image-rich clauses. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances position, temperature, or knowledge. Metaphors are sparse, coherent: tower as “silent sentinel” fits ruined-world tone. Opening and final lines are ear-tested strong; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-blackout lightning tower + drone hive is fresh synthesis; trope of “machine sacrifice” is rare in short form. Specifics—nectar dusk, lacquer map-box—are idiosyncratic, not catalog fantasy. Risk: lyric rather than action climax could feel abstract, but the orb vision is brief and grounded in tactile glow. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ but clearly above mid-list.</comment>
