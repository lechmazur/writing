<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are declared (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) but never tested against an opposing force; the only micro-choice is rearranging tesserae, which carries no visible cost or risk. Interiority drifts into thesis language—“mercy should not be a rarity”—rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive flashes supply memory, not conflicting impulse; she never hesitates, refuses, or loses anything. The result is a coherent stance but not a crucible that reweights her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s new image reframes mercy as strength, and the wind’s “scent of renewal” offers felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each tessera placed adds density until the plaza becomes beacon. The lens holds, but the orientation anchor is soft—no time cue until “after the great fire,” ~150 words in; the waiver applies because disorientation serves the lyric pattern. The ending lands cleanly, yet the middle sags with repeated paraphrases of the same impulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The skeletal minaret, ash-dust, and chipped tesserae create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Elara’s reclamation project; the mosaic literally guides her fingers. Sensory hierarchy is narrow—visual dust, acrid smell—mirroring her obsessive focus. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, brush, stand, step back. The “shattered sky” is atmospheric but static; it never affects options, capping the score below 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are declared—make mercy normal—but no external pressure opposes Elara; the only obstacle is the damaged mosaic itself. Escalation is textural: each tessera placed adds weight rather than risk. A single micro-turn occurs when she sees the gleaming fragment as “key,” but it narrows no live option. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the price of her labor is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mosaic repair: mercy reclaimed as civic foundation. Subtext resides in the tessera’s gleam—hope extracted from detritus—avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of the plaza as “beacon” reweights earlier sorrow without sermon. One soft echo of prompt jargon—“aberrant mercy”—survives but is embedded in action, not lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; diction leans poetic but remains in character for a retrocognitive visionary. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for memory, shorter fragments for tactile beats. Filter verbs crop up (“seemed to whisper”) but align with her spectral mindset. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence is consistent, if occasionally lulled into template parallelism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Strong openers—“skeletal silhouette against the shattered sky”—but mid-passages slip into synonym loops: “mercy had become aberrant, a weakness…mercy was no longer aberrant but essential.” Three consecutive sentences open “Elara…” creating template cadence. Metaphors hold—tessera as key, plaza as beacon—but density thins when abstraction replaces image. Closure line avoids artifact, ending on sensory renewal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses post-catastrophism with craft-as-activism; the mosaic repair is a fresh, non-violent revolutionary act. Retrocognitive entrapment and “renaming” verge on prompt jargon but are grounded in tactile labor. Risk is quiet—no antagonist, no bodily peril—yet the specificity of tessera manipulation keeps it from generic allegory. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meriting high-single-digit credit.</comment>
