<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior life is textured—her skepticism about the label “crystal gazer,” her tactile ritual with the railing—but her decision to carry the strip away is announced rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulse in the moment, so the cost is inferred, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The film strip’s causal chain is clear: found → incubated → reveals letters → reweighted meaning → taken. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of her descending with the strip crystallizes a new purpose and forecloses leaving the love archived. Cost is conceptual—she now shoulders the repository—but the beat is compressed into one sentence; the tightening is legible yet not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Projection booth doubles as micro-setting: the dusty reels and cracked window filter moonlight onto the strip, constraining her ritual and later charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong—one beam, one hum, one strip—each detail re-used, none touristy. The palace’s grandeur is sketched quickly, then abandoned; the booth alone is lived-in and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—locate unused love—stated early; pressure tightens once when letters merge and overwrite each other, forcing her realization that the booth is the archive. No further narrowing; escalation plateaus after that single beat. Cost is conceptual (she inherits the archive) but not dramatized through a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of goodbye letters merging into a single strip; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image of Elara exiting with the strip reweights the premise: unused love can be mobilized, not merely stored. Ambiguity is purposeful—will release work?—and lingers without moralizing. One near-platitude (“theater felt…a living thing”) is filtered through her perception, so spared deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter—her skepticism, her tactile attention to frayed edges. Syntax is calm, slightly antique (“palpable,” “frayed”) matching the vintage venue. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; interior voice remains consistent. One lyrical compression—letters “searching for a tune”—is earned by prior sound imagery (projector hum).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, scaffold-free; sentence openings vary, no loops or paraphrase. Information density high—each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“whisper of history,” “hushed thunder”). No artifacts in closure beat; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychometry of unlabeled film strip revealing a love archive—feels fresh against standard ghost-in-the-theater tropes. Goodbye letters merging into celluloid is a specific, non-obvious image that reweights the concept of unused love. Risk is moderate: lyrical still-frame letters could have slid into gimmick, but the compression keeps it earned. Could swap venue with minor edits, hence not higher.</comment>
