<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s olfactory gift and ambition are established early, but the interior contradiction between drive and emptiness is narrated rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the climax’s tearful realization is credible yet leans on summary. No secondary character appears, so status dynamics are N/A. The earned shift from striving to surrender is legible, but the cost is more stated (“tears welled”) than embodied in a visible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean within 120 words; closure lands as Charged Poise—the final journal image crystallizes her reweighted stance with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sprout’s aroma triggers the insight; no causality break. Meets 9- gate (≥8.8) only if cost were more viscerally anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Treetop village, garden perch, and corpse-flower sprout are vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the “wildflower hush” recurs and charges the final quiet image. Spatial choreography is stable; no object teleporting. Micro-setting (the sprout) constrains her attention and choices, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: ambition vs. present-moment serenity. Pressure deepens via accumulating sensory cues; the sprout’s aroma forces the decisive tightening. Cost is legible as she abandons her old striving stance; still, the price could be sharper (no tangible loss shown). Clean escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the corpse-flower’s gift: wisdom as harmony of motion and rest. Subtext resides in scent and doodled images rather than exposition. Final journal page offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries yet stops just short of undeniable conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Diction is florid yet consistent with her sensuous world (“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short inhalation beat at climax. No dialogue to test. Achieves 9- but not 9+ because voice could risk more syntactic surprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence variety good. Occasional elevated register (“journalize,” “conceptual repricing”) fits character but edges close to thesaurus churn once. No mixed metaphors or loops. Information density high; every paragraph advances. One paraphrase loop (“wisdom…serenity…growth”) mildly dulls final third, capping 9+.</comment>

<comment>Corpse-flower wisdom trope is refreshed by olfactory synesthesia and journal-doodle lineage. Treetop village feels particular, not generic forest. Risk is moderate—accumulative lyric rather than twist-driven—yet coherence stays high. Transformation test passes: Elara’s scent-gift and family doodle habit are irreplaceable.</comment>
