<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but leans on abstract labels (“the world itself had grown weary of sound”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final renunciation is telegraphed rather than forced by a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is secure by ~120 words; the chronic hush → bowl → music chain supplies a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens that holds to the Charged Poise ending, yet the causal link between “playing to the hush” and the land’s exhalation is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels ambient rather than personally levied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, shipwreck ribs, and ash under fingernails deliver sensory economy; the fractured glass catching light reappears at closure to mirror the repaired sonic “glass,” qualifying as environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she coax the land to speak?”—is clear; the only tightening is the violin notes finally swallowed then released, but the hush itself never counter-punches or raises price; escalation is a gentle swerve, not a forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-ruin emerges through recurring images of fractured glass and charred soil rather than commentary; the bowl-as-story-vessel reweights from relic to conduit in the final paragraph, offering quiet resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains a controlled, rhythmic cadence; selective metaphors (“wooden bones groaning”) stay inside Elara’s acoustic perceptual frame, achieving perceptual signature without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; sporadic template cadence (“She thought of… of the… of the…”) and an occasional stacked adjective (“haunting and beautiful”) dull momentum but do not touch the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rainforest-fire + shipwreck + greenhouse collage is visually fresh, yet the hush-as-sentient motif drifts toward familiar eco-parable; risk is moderate, specificity high, transformation partial.</comment>
