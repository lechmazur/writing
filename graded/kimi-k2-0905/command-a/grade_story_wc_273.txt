<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s loss-driven mission is visceral and embodied (“anger…burned deep within her”). The final micro-choice—accepting the ink as mirror, not eraser—carries cost (“tears welled”), but the interior contradiction is stated rather than enacted in-scene; her stance shifts without a visible intermediate struggle that would push her into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drone trace → tent encounter → ink vision → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing on the final walk-away image (“canvas waiting to be filled”) with felt cost (grief faced, brother’s death un-erased). One minor causal hiccup: the woman’s identity and access to the ink remain unmotivated, but the beat is not resolution-critical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Desert wind-carved topography is used as emotional seismograph (“world had paused to catch its breath”). The hummingbird drone and vial function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (tracking, final acceptance). Light-after-eclipse re-illuminates both sand and grief, charging the closing image. Spatial tracking stays clean throughout the single-scene move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—uncover ink’s secret to explain brother’s death—stays coherent. Middle tightening: ink reveals irreversible past rather than controllable future, foreclosing her revenge-fantasy option. Price is grief re-experienced, but external pressure is moderate (no ticking clock or antagonist), keeping escalation just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “confront, don’t rewrite,” anchored in the ink-mirror metaphor. Subtext is carried by drone flight and shifting light rather than exposition. Final reprise of eclipse-light reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity remains: ink’s origin and woman’s motives stay opaque, sustaining reflective space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s desert-tracker perception: “wind-sculpted sand,” “metallic wings glinting,” sensory hierarchies feel profession-specific. Syntax flexes under pressure—“time itself seemed to bend”—without POV leakage. Dialogue is brief but carries subtext (ink as mirror). Voice keeps calm surface while anger pulses, matching serene-anger tone request.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences twin-job (image + interiority). No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and precise. Occasional slight filter (“seemed to”) but not clustered. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; opening line anchors stakes, final line releases image. Clean grammar and spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Time-bending ink + drone-tracking is fresh synthesis; eclipse aftermath as grief-reset is elegant. Premise risks “mystical substance” trope but is rescued by refusal to grant control, turning trope into mirror. Desert setting and albino tracker add specific surface novelty, yet emotional arc (grief → acceptance) remains familiar, capping originality below 8.</comment>
