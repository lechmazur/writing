<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s yearning for lost memories is concrete and embodied—his fingers keep returning to the wildflowers—but the story never lets us see him make a true micro-choice under pressure; the “exhume” beat is entirely internal and passive, so the cost feels abstract rather than paid on his body. The wildflowers guide, but they don’t force a forked path; the chamber simply reveals, never tests. Interior contradiction is sketched, not dramatized. Earned stasis is gestured at, not visibly priced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt-chamber inciting image and the final “gleaming silence” reprise form a clean Conceptual Repricing: Eli re-enters the same room but sees it as a memory reliquary, not a lab. Causality is lyrical rather than plot-tight—coffee-ground patterns, whale omen, wildflower synapses—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty. Closure is quiet yet legible, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt-crystal walls aren’t mere wallpaper—they amplify the gravity pockets that make memory-visible, directly enabling the climax. Tactile specificity (lamp-wick, crunch of salt under shoes) is filtered through a lantern-lighter’s occupational gaze, lending micro-setting authority. Spatial choreography stays crisp in a single-room scene. Final image of crystals “returned to their silent watch” crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—recover deleted memories—but pressure escalates only texturally (shimmer intensifies, gravity tug) rather than through narrowed options or risk. No meaningful fork or resource lost; the “exhume” action is experiential, not tactical. Accumulative lens accepts this, yet cost remains conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient for mid-high band, but not 8.8+ without a price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as salt-crystal lattice—hidden yet intact, mis-erased rather than gone. Subtext of retrieval vs acceptance is left ambiguous; final smile could be solace or surrender, inviting rereading. No explicit thesis, only image-based reweighting. Complexity is honored; whale, wildflowers, coffee grounds stay particular, never allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres tightly to Eli’s sensory funnel; diction stays within a dock-worker’s register (“adjusted the wick,” “brush against”). Rhythm echoes lighthouse cadence—steady, then a hush—supporting “gleaming silence” tone. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Occasional poetic lift (“memories floated like fragments of light”) is justified by climax’s lyric height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, mostly propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the chamber glowed… the crystals seemed…”) slightly thins density. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. A few filter verbs (“he felt”) dull peak immediacy, but not enough to obscure closure image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene’s hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of salt-crystal lab, whale omen, and coffee-ground divination feels fresh, never gimmicky; sci-fi concept grows from maritime folk practice. Memory-erasure trope is tilted toward geophysical rather than digital, giving new slant. Wildflower catalyst is specific to beach-find context, not generic flora. Risky lyric stance is committed to fully, paying off in final reconfigured hush.</comment>
