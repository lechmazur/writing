<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s gift is dramatized through tactile contact with coral walls that literally taste of regret; the embodied cost (tears, dissolving shard) makes her interior arc credible. Contradictory impulses—burden of others’ pain vs. her own need to heal—co-exist in the central chamber beat. Final renunciation (absorbing the heart-shard) forecloses her prior detachment with visible physical price. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of memory-flavors intensifies until the coral heart reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—pavilion melts, Elara lighter, cost registered in tears and dissolving shard. Orientation anchored by 75 words; no penalty. Causality intact: each memory tasted → pavilion weakens → final absorption. Cost legible in “tears welled” and “piece of her own sorrow” gone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desert-after-rain scent, frozen coral corridors, and the pulsating shard form a tightly filtered sensory arc. Tidal-pool method is taught early and guides locating the pavilion, constraining next move. Micro-setting (coral wall etchings) physically interacted with, altering Elara’s emotional state. Final image of melting walls ties environment to internal thaw, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute remorse—signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: arrival at central chamber forces either total absorption or retreat; option foreclosed when she touches the shard. Cost visible: tears, physical dissolution of pavilion, “piece of her own sorrow” evacuated. Escalation driven by her serial choices to taste→smooth→absorb; no coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: remorse is portable yet shareable; its transmutation is possible but never painless. Subtext carried in coral imagery—frozen beauty grown from human error. Final melting image reweights premise: pain can be thawed but never deleted. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “for now, it was gone.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s palate-centric perception; diction (“sandpaper rough memories,” “coral icebound”) remains within her sensory lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during corridor tasting, then slows for final absorption. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Filter verbs (“she knew,” “she felt”) are sparse and motivated by tasting mechanism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; no template cadence detected. Figurative language clustered but patterned (taste/memory) and paid off at closure. High density: “Each line told a story, each curve a memory” compresses cartography and emotion. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”-adjacent) offset by consistent sensory diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef absorbing crystallized regret is a fresh synthesis; desert-coral reversal feels inevitable once revealed. Tidal-pool cartography method is specific, not gimmick. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off with melting final image. Premise not easily transplanted; Elara’s palate and the coral ecology are co-dependent.</comment>
