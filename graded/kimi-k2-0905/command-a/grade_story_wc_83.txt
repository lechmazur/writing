<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zara’s loss and new purpose register, but interiority relies on template phrases (“a stark reminder,” “shattered world”) and diagnostic self-labeling (“unfiltered awakening”) that flattens embodied emotion. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; choices are either declarative or purely observational. The final stance is legible, yet it is declared rather than paid for through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the crystal image reweights the stake and signals earned seeker identity. Causality is loose—perturbation theory is named late and never shapes tactics—so the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no caps triggered. Cost is felt but not materially demonstrated in a final action or forfeiture, keeping score below 8.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory and crystal interiors supply vivid, selective sensory detail; the ash scent anchors the opening beat and the geode’s “trapped light” returns to charge the ending. Spatial grounding is secure; electromagnetic suspension rule is learned through action. Environment does not constrain a visible tactical choice, so 9+ gate fails. Overall, atmosphere is the story’s strongest suit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hunt for latent potential—signals early and recurs, but pressure plateaus; no second tightening or trade-off complicates the search. Escalation is poetic (crystal glow moment) rather than causal; cost is implied, not dramatized. Protagonist agency remains observational; no resource or option is visibly foreclosed. Meets short-form minimum but lacks visible price that would push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilient transformation emerges organically via geode imagery without overt thesis statement. Final image reprises crystal light, offering quiet reconfiguration. Ambiguity is present but not complex—no counter-readings or moral tension complicate the uplift. Emotional after-effect is muted because cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stays stable; perceptual signature relies on repeated “as if” constructions and abstract noun stacks that edge toward template cadence. Diction remains within plausible range for a reflective survivor. Rhythm breathes appropriately across paragraphs; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice is competent but not yet singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and mostly concise; occasional scaffold phrases (“a scent that clung… like a second skin,” “a spark of unfiltered awakening”) recycle metaphoric shells. No mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality; clarity stays intact. Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts pass. Minor figurative shorthand keeps it from 9-band but does not derail closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Drone-strike wedding and floating geode observatory yield a fresh composite; post-catastrophe physics-as-healing is less familiar. Risk is moderate: lyric interiority over causal plot. Synthesis feels personal, though premise could swap genres with little friction. Insight stays at surface level; no bold structural or moral risk taken.</comment>
