<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“chaste courtesan” paradox is stated, not dramatized; body-poetic trait is invoked but never tested under pressure, so cost feels honorary rather than earned. No contradictory impulse acts in scene; the untangling is calm, mistake-free, almost ritual. The smile at the end signals poise, not renunciation with visible price; motivation stays abstract—“defy conformity”—without micro-choices that foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each untangling step loosens the lattice and literally opens the door; the final dance releases the echoes, producing a legible before/after for the city. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard now “hums with potential,” a crystallized image that reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual—she will “never be the same courtesan”—but no persistent constraint or price is shown on-page; the smile feels lightly won. Orientation is clear within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and falling snow are not backdrop: the lattice threads are literally woven from memories, so setting becomes the tool that must be manipulated; the crystalline walls refract starlight onto the final dance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean—door, lattice, chamber track without drift. Sensory economy is tight—cold breath, hum of threads, swirl of voices—never catalogued. Environment plus body (poetic motion) together satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“awaken the city”—is signaled early; escalation is the tightening of the lattice: each loosened thread raises the risk of losing a memory-voice, a causal micro-cost. Agency is continuous—every finger trace is a choice that materially changes the lock. No visible price is paid by Elara herself (no injury, social loss, or irreversible bodily change), so the cost feels external; this keeps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of individual voice versus manufactured peace emerges through the tactile metaphor of harvested echoes; no abstract thesis is stated. The final image—snowflakes now “carrying fragments” of released voices—reweights the opening serenity without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: we do not know if awakening helps or hurts the city. Alarming serenity tone stays coherent, modulating from hush to resonant chord, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance; diction is elevated but anchored in Elara’s bodily perception—“her breath visible,” “her fingers brushing.” Rhythm swells and contracts with the untangling, then opens into the echo-symphony, supporting pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is her kinesthetic precision. Filter verbs are minimal; the rare one (“seemed to whisper”) is atmosphere, not loophole. Meets 9+ test for patterned control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“lullaby of conformity” is sustained, not contradicted. Density remains high: each sentence advances image or causality. Occasional elevated register (“bodily poetic grace,” “conceptual repricing”) drifts slightly above POV lexicon but is consistent with mythic tone; not enough to ding. Final third clean; 9+ still disallowed by external-cost gap, not line artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—rebel courtesan, memory lattice, awakening sleeping city—are refreshed by tactile mechanics: untangling threads literally frees voices into snowfall. The “harvest of echoes” concept is the freshest inflection, turning metaphor into manipulable object. Risk is present but safe; no structural gamble beyond lyric elevation. Specificity of bodily-poetic movement and refracted starlight keeps it from feeling template. Synthesis feels inevitable, not borrowed.</comment>
