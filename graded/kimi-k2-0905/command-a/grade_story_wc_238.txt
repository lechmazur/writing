<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-granddaughter contradiction is alive in her body (trembling bottle, breath-catching) and drives the micro-choice to channel the current; the apology-as-energy is a credible renunciation that costs her the weight of the bottle. Interiority slips once into “imperfect miracles” thesis-speak, but the embodied memory of soil-stained laughter keeps her from abstraction. Grandmother never appears as second character, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; reflection % stays within BRR limit because each recall cue tilts present stance. Loss of 0.2 for diagnostic tag “miracles aren’t perfect” delivered without immediate embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle’s lightness reweights the premise—regret is not erased but metabolized into current. Causal chain holds: orchard doom → bottle hum → current apology → archive glow, each ‘because’ tightening options. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the final image—“scent lingering on her skin”—a persistent constraint she’ll carry past the tree-fall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sheet music archive functions as micro-setting: the shelves’ “whispered secrets” guide her attention to the bottle and later echo back as glowing notes, constraining her ritual. Orchard outside is sketched through sensory economy—held-breath air, rustle of soon-lost leaves—mirroring internal stakes without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean: corner-lamp → shelf → outside grove, no impossible moves. The perfume bottle itself acts as portable setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—tightens once when the bottle’s hum forces the current-channeling choice; orchard clock is felt but not ticking minute-by-minute. Escalation is emotional, not external: pressure moves from static regret to embodied current-release, narrowing her option to metaphysical action. Cost is legible—she forfeits the bottle’s weight/hold and accepts the scent’s permanent stain. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges through the cracked-glass image re-priced at closure; no final-paragraph sermon. Subtext operates in silence: the archive’s hush and the orchard’s pre-fall stillness speak the unsayable grief. Ambiguity lingers—trees will still fall, forgiveness is felt not proven—avoiding tidy moral. One ornamental echo of prompt phrase “imperfect miracles” dampens full resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: “fingers tracing ridges,” “breath catching,” syntax mirroring her hush-and-current cadence. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no academic register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on internal texture, which remains consistent. Rhythm accelerates into sentence fragments during current-release beat, then exhales into longer cadence for closure, taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are spare and grounded—“ghostly flower” is single, apt, dropped before purple risk. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges scent motif. One near-filter verb stack (“seemed to hum, seemed to sigh”) forgiven because pattern hum is diegetically taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” is mentioned not exploited, but the perfume-bottle-as-current-conductor freshens standard ghost-story tropes. Orchard demolition versus archive preservation offers subtle development-vs-memory conflict, not overt message. Risk lies in lyric compression rather than twist, and the closure’s scent-stain feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight deduction for un-utilized occupation detail that could have sharpened social stakes.</comment>
