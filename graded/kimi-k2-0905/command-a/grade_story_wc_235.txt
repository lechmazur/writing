<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands on the birch scroll, the weight of feral nostalgia in her veins—but the “getting jealous of past selves” mechanism is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The final shift from envy to gratitude is cleanly motivated by the mid-air dialogue, so the arc earns its change, yet the cost feels more conceptual than corporeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: the scroll’s glow, the shifting dream-fragments, and the sentence “The story is not in the past or future—it is now” act as pattern breaks that reweight the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that lands with felt cost—her nostalgia is literally lifted like fog—so the ending satisfies under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and star-strewn dream-sky are rendered with selective, sense-driven detail; the scroll evolves from brittle artifact to glowing map, constraining her choice to take flight. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she lifts off and looks back at the “tiny speck” cabin, anchoring the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—taming unruly dreams—tightens when the scroll rewrites itself and the past-selves confrontation forces her to renounce envy. One meaningful deepening suffices: the realization that she is a continuum, not fragments, forecloses the escape-into-past option with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulates: birch bark, mirror-shards of memory, the final sentence that re-prices time. No explicit moralizing; the resonance is in the image of the mountains “humming approval,” an earned, non-literal answer to the chaos-to-narrative quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a consistent lyric register; perceptual signature is sharp—“jaded wonder blooming in her chest” is character-specific. Rhythm modulates from grounded creaking floor to weightless aerial glide without syntactic monotony; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is taut, image-dense, and loop-free; figurative language is selective (“feral nostalgia,” “shattered mirror”) and never clusters in high-pressure beats. Opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly; no scaffold or paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “own grave” hook and lucid-dream cartography feel fresh, yet the jealous-of-past-selves beat is a known trope; the synthesis is specific enough to transcend checklist territory. Risk is moderate—lyric dream-flight—but execution is confident, not gimmicky.</comment>
