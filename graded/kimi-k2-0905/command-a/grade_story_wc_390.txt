<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied: the cool metal cue anchors every spike of dread, and her contradictory “logically emotional” split is dramatized in the moment she demands proof while already stepping toward surrender. The final refusal costs her the illusion of safety and is earned by the earlier tactile study of the key. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is once asserted rather than shown, but the embodied trembling palms compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: vibration → recognition → ascent → key-glow → confrontation → harmonic counter-attack. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses alliance with the intruder and accepts perpetual guardianship under moonlight; the cost is the audible retreat of the ice and her solitary stance. Lens holds causal throughout; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not postcard; the cracking ice becomes the antagonist’s instrument and later the gauge of her victory. The key’s warming surface and the lantern’s hidden compartment are micro-settings that constrain her options. Final image of moonlit ice recharges the opening sunset, re-weighting the same landscape from promise to perpetual burden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardianship of the key—tightens when the vibration forces her to decide: use it or lose it. The mid-story temptation to trust the intruder narrows her moral option to solitary defense, a visible trade-off. Price is paid: the key’s glow scars the intruder but also announces her location to future seekers, a persistent tactical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmonic balance emerges through the key’s refusal to be used for domination; no character states “balance is needed.” The final moonlit silence re-prices the sunset’s warmth as cold isolation, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without sermon. One line edges toward echo—“the world is out of tune”—but is saved by being the antagonist’s seductive pitch, not the narrator’s verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is crystalline winter engineering diction—“lantern room’s mechanism,” “vibrational matching”—that melts into syntactic shivers during peaks. No filter-verb clusters; rhythm accelerates up the spiral stairs then fragments during harmonic combat, mirroring pulse. Dialogue line from antagonist carries subtextual seduction rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyric; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; ice cracks are rendered with onomatopoeic brevity. One paraphrase loop (“the key’s power… the key’s energy”) grazes the climax but does not obscure causality; still disallowing 9+ globally under artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen-lighthouse sonic-defense is a fresh mash-up; the key as tuning fork rather than sword avoids generic relic trope. The intruder’s harmonic voice that bypasses ears is a specific, non-obvious peril. Risk of concept-piece is offset by anchored sensory specifics; transformation survives proximity test—could not swap setting or tool without breaking logic.</comment>
