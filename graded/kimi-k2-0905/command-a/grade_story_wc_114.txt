<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her auroral sorrow is embodied (fingers smudging ink, visual blur) and her contradictory impulse to preserve yet distort the flower drawing is dramatized. “Fault-tolerant oracle” remains a label until the final beat; her unique power is told, not tested under pressure. The renunciation—accepting imperfect truth—is earned and felt on the last page, satisfying the 9+ cost test despite the late, abstract reveal of gift mechanics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV default met; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 50. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s Charged Poise over the smudged illustration crystallizes her new stance—truth as living distortion—and the conceptual cost (permanent uncertainty) is legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the blurring flower, station creaks, and ozone scent thicken until the final image reweights stakes; no meaningful tightening beyond the final cadence shift, so just short of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain station is sketched with spare, selective detail—metal frame memory, ozone scent, wind gusts—that mirror internal sway. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: its ink texture, veins, and smudge constrain every beat; her finger on the paper is the final image. Environment never over-described; each sensory note feeds POV bias and accumulates toward closure. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges the last image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she reconcile the jagged truth—signaled early; pressure is situational: the station’s liminality and the wanderer’s visit force stance crystallization. Single meaningful tightening: the smudge choice narrows options from seeking purity to embracing distortion. Cost is conceptual (permanent uncertainty) but not viscerally felt until final sentence; escalation is gentle, textural. Agency is present but interior; no external loss beyond symbolic ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as living imperfection, beauty in distortion. The smudged flower reprises with reweighted meaning—no moral spoon-fed. Subtext pulses in gesture (finger tracing smudge, silence after wanderer leaves). Final image invites counter-reading: acceptance or resignation? Complexity intact; no platitude. Loses 0.2 for near-echo of “truth is heavier” phrasing in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature strong—she notices ozone, petal gradients, station creaks in character-specific hierarchy. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments under visual blur. No head-hop; free indirect clean. Diction within lexicon; “auroral sorrow” is lone poetic reach but justified by fever-vision context. Voice distinct, stable, and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, information-dense; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (flower breathing, truth as root) stay consistent and physically coherent. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“jagged shard” swallowed—minor, does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with charged image. No artifacts in final third; high-band safe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fault-tolerant oracle + botanical ink smudge as truth-metaphor is non-obvious. Risk taken with quiet, interior arc pays off. Detail specificity (ozone-scented station, alpine flower veins) prevents generic template. “Wanderer” veers toward archetype; could be sharper. Concept stays committed; no retreat to tidy reassurance. Within 0.1 of 8.0 for memorable angle, not higher because archetype slightly dilutes freshness.</comment>
