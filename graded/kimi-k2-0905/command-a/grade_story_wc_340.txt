<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority and embodied micro-choices are present on every floor—each page-pick doubles as a concrete stance-shift. The mentor’s goggles fuse legacy and sight-line, hardening the rising want to “see the joy.” No contradictory impulses are dramatised on the page, only sequential discoveries; hence the full high-band contradiction test is unmet and caps the score. Still, the final tearful recognition of self-driven meaning lands with implicit cost, satisfying the renunciation/crystallisation threshold.

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean causal elevator spine (“floor X therefore floor X+1”) keeps orientation immediate and stakes legible. Closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing: mentor’s decrypted maxim re-weights earlier anguish as the necessary lens for joy—felt cost is the melted detachment itself. No persistent price or constraint lingers beyond the emotional realisation, preventing 9-band entry. The pattern stays linear, so Accumulative lens is rejected; judged under Causal lens, closure logic holds.

<comment>Icebound spire, aurora shimmer, and prism-rainbow are filtered through goggle-lenses that literally constrain what Elara can perceive; these optic limitations shape the deciphering beats and final auroral reading, fulfilling the 9-band gate. Spatial choreography across ten floors is crystal-clear via elevator anchoring. Cold-air breath and frost-covered props keep tactile pressure constant; weather affects stamina and mood. Micro-setting (diary, goggles) doubles as environmental extension, tying personal legacy to the wider vault of stars.

<comment>Dominant stake—uncover mentor’s hidden meaning before oxygen or hope runs out—is signalled in paragraph one and tightens with each floor’s single-page lure. Incremental revelations (page, riddle, key) accumulate rather than escalate causally, but the pattern is coherent under Accumulative lens; meaningful deepening occurs at floor-eight portrait where key choice commits her to final decryption. Cost is emotional, not material, and paid in the observatory tear-moment; because the price is internal, it is felt but less viscerally legible than a forfeited object would be. Still, agency stays with Elara at every turn; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: encoded grief must be “read” through the very stillness that seems to deny joy. Subtext resides in optic imagery—light scattered, frozen, magnified—culminating in the aurora that redefines anguish as the prism for joy. Final decoded sentence avoids direct moralising, letting image carry the reweighting. Some abstraction in “joy beneath anguish” is unavoidable given prompt origin, but it is substantiated through layered sensory motifs, so the thematic echo penalty is waived.

<comment>Third-limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter, no head-hop. Syntax is controlled, lightly rhythmic, with purposeful repetition of “unfolded,” “scattered light,” and “goggles” to build an accumulative chant. No dialogue means no voice-distinction issues; internal diction remains within servant-class plausibility. Occasional template opening (“The X floor…”) slightly flattens cadence but never derails momentum or clarity.

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence forwards discovery or atmosphere without scaffold. Repetitive stem “The [noun] floor…” appears six times—enough to register as template cadence but serving as structural mnemonic rather than clutter; deduction is minor. Mixed-metaphor risk in “machinery groaned to life” and “air grew thinner, and the cold sharper” stays within physical logic, so no coherence penalty. No loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity at closure is pristine.

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Concept of an ascending scavenger hunt inside a crystalline sky-spire is fresh, yet execution follows familiar puzzle-box beats without subverting them. Goggle-as-legacy and encrypted diary are standard steampunk cargo; the scattered-light decoding mechanic is the single inventive inflection that feels specific to this piece. Emotional payoff is honest but not structurally surprising. Overall, an appealing improvisation rather than a genre-bending risk.
