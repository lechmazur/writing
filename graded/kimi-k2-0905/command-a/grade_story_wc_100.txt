<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s stubbornness is named, not shown—no scene beats where it blocks or forces a choice with visible cost. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“giving rest a permanent address”) without contradictory impulse under pressure. The lens-assembly quest is linear; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values or new flaw. Closure is a gentle uplift, not an earned renunciation or charged poise; cost is felt only generically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: package → lens hunt → assembly → beacon, each because/therefore step legible. Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—the city’s first starlight in centuries—reweighting the premise with undeniable visual cost. One soft spot: the library’s spatial logic is sketched rather than constrained (no map, no limited air, no collapsing shelf that blocks a next move), so agency never tightens. Still, the final image reconfigures meaning and satisfies the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underwater library is rendered through seaweed-green book pulp, coral-encrusted statue, collapsed beam—selective, tactile, lived-in. Lantern light refracts off cracked glass, giving micro-setting an active role in discovery beats. Environment does not physically constrain choices (no failing air pocket, no structural collapse) so stays shy of 9+ gate. Nevertheless, atmosphere is coherent, idiosyncratic, and charges the final luminous image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city’s voice must be heard—signalled early; pressure escalates by each fragment recovered, tightening the task. No reversal or trade-off is forced; options never narrow catastrophically, so tension stays moderate. Protagonist agency is present but risk-free; cost is aesthetic (effort, fatigue) rather than forfeiture. Closure’s conceptual repricing supplies the missing felt cost retroactively, allowing the upper-7 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of giving rest to the forgotten emerges through image (undertaker, drowned dead, beacon) without sermon. Subtext operates in lantern-light versus darkness, silence versus signal—quiet, effective. No motif is allowed to constrain choice; hence resonance is atmospheric rather than stake-altering. Ending reweights meaning, but the insight is tender rather than complex or ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent Gothic-lyric: “weight of years spent burying the unburyable,” “chased stillness.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses in fragment search, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so no register clash; diction stays within undertaker’s mournful lexicon. One filter-verb cluster (“felt a strange connection”) slips into summary; otherwise perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, with vivid nouns (“seaweed-green leather,” “fractured prisms”). One metaphor string in climax (“rest a permanent address,” “tide receding”) is decorative but not muddled. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; sentences vary in length and opening. Occasional elevated phrase (“metaphorical darkness”) nudges register slight-above POV, keeping it short of 8+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Underwater librarian undertaker reassembling a soul-beacon is fresh synthesis; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with lyric, almost fabulist escalation—no villains, no countdown—yet coherence holds. Specificity of funerary craft plus drowned archive gives memorable angle. Could swap names but not vocation-setting-image trio, so originality is solid mid-8.</comment>
