<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The arsonist’s “volcanic tenderness” is a compelling contradiction, but interiority stays at label level (“analytically intuitive mind,” “singular motivation”) rather than dramatized thought. No contradictory impulse is shown in scene; the figure moves unruffled from clue to clue. The tear at the scroll is the only embodied emotion, arriving late and unearned. Because the promise costs the protagonist nothing visible, the arc feels observed, not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scroll re-weights the vandalized portrait/tapestry pair with civilizational love-sacrifice cost. Causal chain is present—tapestry → portrait → mural → sketches → scroll—yet each jump is declared (“they realized”) rather than forced by pressure. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. The because/therefore links are functional but thin, so the tightening feels administrative, not inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Archive is sketched in atmospheric strokes (echoing stone, dust, dim light) that stay consistent. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—but selective enough to avoid clutter. The vandalized portrait and tapestry serve as micro-settings that focus attention; they do not physically constrain choice, so the 9-gate is missed. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible moves.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled early and reiterated, but the promise’s content remains abstract until the scroll. Escalation is accumulative: each artwork adds a layer of meaning rather than narrows physical options. No credible loss (time, tool, risk of capture) is shown; pressure is intellectual, not visceral. The final scroll revelation reweights meaning, satisfying the 8.2+ gate for thematic cost, yet the absence of felt price keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of love-as-preservation emerges organically from image chain (tapestry vow → vandalized likeness → scroll testament). No moralizing sentence spells it out; the reader completes the echo. The vandalism of the self-portrait quietly poses the question: is erasure an act of hate or a hidden message of devotion? The ending’s reconfiguration avoids tidy uplift, leaving plausible ambiguity between personal and civic love.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintainsdistance appropriate to mythic tone; diction stays controlled (“ethereal glow,” “frayed but colors still vivid”). No POV slippage or filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates between long atmospheric sentences and short discovery beats, supporting momentum. Voice is not yet unmistakably singular—some phrasing edges toward stock (“labyrinth of forgotten knowledge”)—but remains coherent and unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“they knew,” “they realized”) that dulls immediacy in two spots. Metaphors are restrained and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Two instances of “they” opener clustering and one overlong sentence at the scroll beat keep it shy of 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The “library arsonist who does not burn but decrypts” is a fresh inversion; the artistic breadcrumb trail within a lost archive is less novel but executed with conviction. Specificity of the vandalized self-portrait as encoded love-message gives the concept muscle. Reliance on abstract civiliation-collapse backdrop rather than lived detail keeps the world generic. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids gimmick yet also avoids deep personalization of the relics.</comment>
