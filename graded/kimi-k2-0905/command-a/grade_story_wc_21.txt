<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—Elara “felt a glimmer of hope” rather than embodying contradiction under pressure. Single on-page character means no relationship crucible; her micro-choice (arranging debris) is present yet low-stakes because lagoon response is externalized miracle, not driven by her flaw. Backstory capsule (grandfather’s letters) is cleanly cued and tilts present action, satisfying BRR. No earned cost at closure—hope arrives as gift, not renunciation—so arc feels suspended rather than foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: lagoon entity nods, waters still, Elara senses “the sands holding breath,” reconfiguring meaning with felt敬畏. Causal chain is thin—entity appears because shells are arranged, a quasi-magical handshake that skirts protagonist-driven cost. Orientation clear by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation rather than because-therefore drives the piece, lens held. Non-closure accumulation: one soft reset—diary weight declared heavy yet never constraints tactics—caps Q2 at 8.0, so 7.4 remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are sharply imaged, each filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze. Micro-setting works: diary as handled object focuses beats; lagoon surface mirrors sky, charging final image. Selective sensory economy—dawn hush, sand sink, engine hum—grounds transitions. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain tactics (she could leave at any time), so gate to 9+ unmet; 8.0 is ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth for the erased—signaled early. Pressure is situational: ritual等待, not escalating obstacles. One meaningful tightening: debris arrangement invites response, narrowing options to wait/flee. Cost is conceptual (time, doubt) but not viscerally paid on-page; entity arrival feels like permission, not consequence. Hence escalation is present but low-band; 6.8 reflects coherent but mild intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of archival salvage versus eraser-silence emerges through concrete images—rust-flaked letters, ciphered diary—never lectured. Final image of still lagoon reweights prior debris pleas as viable testimony, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about entity’s motives. No echo of prompt language. Could sharpen if Elara’s personal complicity or limit were tested; as is, resonance is solid mid-high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person latinate lyricism (“retrocognitively trapped,” “solemn archivist”) sustains atmospheric distance consistent with scholar POV. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentence opens, then clipped beats on sand. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs occasional (“she felt”) but voice-motivated. Register stays high-formal without drift. Distinct perceptual signature—cataloguing decay, codes, wind vectors—just shy of 8+ because syntax never buckles under pressure, keeping safe elegance rather than risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence craft clean: strong verbs (“traced,” “clutch,” “stirred”), no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Information dense; each sentence layers image + motive. Minor overwriting: “dark whisper” + “mirror of the sky” within 3 sentences approaches figurative overload; since pattern not taught, deduct −0.3. No artifact touches closure beat. Overall propulsion strong; 8.1 reflects near-publishable polish with hairline excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating archive + obsidian lagoon is fresh synthesis; aerial文明仓库 negotiating with sub-sand spirit offers non-obvious stage. Archivist-as-medium trope is familiar, but here grounded in civil-rights specificity. Risk taken with magical parley, paid off by coherent atmosphere. Could push further if zeppelin library or diary code displayed unique world rule; instead they serve mainly as mood props. Lands memorable but not transformative; 7.9.</comment>
