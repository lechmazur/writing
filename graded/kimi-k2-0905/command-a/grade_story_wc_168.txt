<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the epiphany—“he began to enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance”—is stated rather than dramatized; no micro-choice visible on the page where he actively relinquishes or forecloses a path. The feather visions function as exposition of others’ pain rather than forcing Elias to risk anything new. Competence and scars are evoked, yet no flawed decision or irreversible loss is shown; thus the change feels observational, not earned. Voice is textured, but the lack of a costly final act caps this below the 7-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box left glowing on the ridge reweights guilt into communal bearing. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each feather flash thickens the textual density rather than altering external options. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the box’s cracks glow—an imago that crystallizes the new stance. Cost is conceptual (perpetual carrying of sorrow) rather than felt on the page; hence the 0.4 gap from 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The porcelain box operates as micro-setting: its cracks constrain Elias’s grip and mirror his skin, charging the final image. Moonlit ridge supplies immediate spatial edge—drop-off, silver light, boulder—but does not alter tactics beyond mood. Sensory triage is POV-true: smoke memory narrows attention to porcelain texture and lunar glow. Environment neither complicates nor resourcefully enables the closure act, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the selective detail is vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate personal guilt into shared language—remains abstract until the final paragraph; no concrete test or forfeiture is staged. Pressure is atmospheric (moon, box hum) rather than causal; no option is foreclosed by Elias’s agency. The single “tightening” is imagistic (cracks glowing), not a decision that raises cost. Coincidence (finding the box) initiates but does not resolve; still, escalation is flat—no visible price alters later tactics—keeping this below the 7.0 floor for meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “bargained innocence” emerges through the porcelain vessel conceit rather than thesis statement; the final image reframes scars as translucent channels. Subtext operates in silence—Elias never verbalizes guilt; instead the feather visions speak for him. The refusal to declare moral lessons lends complexity, but the feather content risks sentimental universality. Resonance is genuine yet slightly generic; the absence of a specific, lived counter-reading caps this short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is firefighter-honed—attention to char, breath, weight of objects. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful enjambment and clause length that mirrors breath节律. No dialogue present; thus no voice convergence risk. Register remains within Elias’s plausible diction; occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial bodies resumed their slow dance”) is earned by reflective mode. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to short cadence at closure, achieving Charged Poise without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“he thought of...”) recycles opening reflection. Metaphors stay coherent—porcelain/body parallelism sustains internal logic. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory memory, symbolic weight, and present action. Two near-paraphrase lines (“weight of others’ sorrows” / “carry his own”) dock 0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats; clarity intact at closure. Final image is crisp, recharging “cracks glow” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The porcelain box as guilt reliquary is a fresh inflection on survivor-trauma tropes; it literalizes “carrying” without slipping into allegory. Celestial choreography motif risks cosmic cliché but is saved by firefighter’s grounded gaze. Specific detail—charred oak roots, cracked porcelain edges—prevents generic anywhere-setting. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not predictable; risk is modest, coherence high. Lacks a radical structural or perspectival gamble that would push into 8.8+ originality band.</comment>
