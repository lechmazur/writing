<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“listening to the void between breaths”), but her contradictory impulses are only asserted, not dramatized; the final smoothing succeeds because the text says so, not because prior micro-choices visibly foreclose an alternative path. Earned cost is gestured at (“weight of her responsibility”) rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed prophecy creates a lingering vigilance whose cost is conceptually legible. Causality is soft—why this wing, why this brook, why now is elided—but the lyrical lens holds; the final image reweights the premise under an accumulative/textural drive. TheOrientation Test is passed by line 4, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The brook, mossy stone, and vibrating paper wing supply micro-setting that constrains her breathing rhythm and thus the ritual; moonlit water becomes a metronome she must match. Sensory economy is high—one scent, one sound, one glint—integrated into action rather than catalogue. The haven’s quiet is not just backdrop but the raw material she weaponizes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—keep prophecy silent—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the wing’s hum syncs heartbeat and brook, forcing her to endure the trance without breaking. Escalation is textural (density of hush) rather than causal; cost is conceptual (“balance was fragile”) not visceral, so the 8.8 gate is missed, but the single deepening is coherent under lyrical design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: silence as both creative and destructive force. No moral is stated; the final mirror-like brook reframes silence as a portable weapon she must carry. Resonance is muted because the prophecy’s content remains abstract, but the concept is cleanly integrated through the crane-wing reprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent arched cadence; diction stays within a mystic register (“terrestrially cosmic”) without glitch. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices current, scent, fold tension in summoner-specific hierarchy. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unchallenged; minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) are acceptably sparse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with purposeful enjambment across commas; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are spare and consistent (moonlight threads, fluid thoughts). Information density is high—each sentence advances ritual stage or sensory grounding. Closure line avoids overwrite, letting mirrored stars reweight the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The “origami wing as sound-sink” is a fresh inflection on familiar spell-component trope; tranquil blaze tension between serenity and apocalypse is non-obvious. However, the summoner-in-haven frame is archetypal and the prophecy-in-code device leans stock. Specificity of paper folds humming with planetary silence lifts it above median.</comment>
