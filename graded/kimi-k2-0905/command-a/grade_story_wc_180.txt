<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “brushing the ribbon” while “a thought forming” shows embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to weave the ribbon into the tree crystallizes her values under pressure. Flaw traction is light: “quartz-eye” remains a label rather than altering perception or risk. Still, the maternal regret is particular and drives every tactical move; the cost is felt when she foregoes restoring the old vow and instead crafts a new covenant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s glow reweights the deciduous premise, proving breakage can be generative. Causal chain holds—key unlocks scroll, petals signal soil, compass points to ribbon; each gadget earned earlier. One soft spot: the “breach” itself is summarized off-stage, so the inciting rupture never carries visceral cost. Nevertheless, the final image of the living cathedral carries undeniable social cost—nature and culture re-wed, vows now seasonal rather than perpetual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard-as-ecosystem is tactile: roots “entwined with ancient stones” forces Elara to climb and reach; the glowing flowers provide the only light at climax, charging the image. Cathedral decay is filtered through maternal urgency—she notices crumbling stairs only as footholds. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: scent of bloom first, visual fragments second. Micro-setting (ribbon on belt) constrains the compass move, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can renewal exist after breach?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the vow is physically rewritten onto the tree. Escalation is accumulative: each gadget ups the ante until the ribbon’s relocation makes the new covenant irreversible. Cost is visible—Elara’s old contract literally rots on the branch she abandons. No external antagonist needed; internal stance shift is sufficient under situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vegetal metaphor: deciduous = necessary loss. Subtext lives in the ribbon’s color fade—time re-dyes meaning. Final image avoids sermon: no sentence states “wisdom comes from pain,” yet the glowing thread in living wood reweights all prior fragments. A hair of sentimentality docks the top band—”promise. The cathedral, once abandoned, now felt alive” nudges allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains Elara’s perceptual signature: “sunlight filtered through shattered stained glass” is rendered as fractured shards her quartz eyes would catch. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses when she climbs, then longer breaths under the blooming tree. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. One micro-template cadence (“She… She… She…”) in paragraph six, but it coincides with ritual action and therefore reads intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences deliver sensory data, world rule, and emotional tilt. Figurative control high—“branches heavy with fruit, leaves rustling with secrets” stays within arboreal logic. Occasional scaffold (“a testament to…”) is minor and outside closure beat. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Final line earns its lift: “ribbon’s faint glow lingered” is monosyllabic fade that mirrors light dying outside.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orchard fusion feels inevitable, not gimmicky, because vegetal reclamation is shown through stair-climb and soil in stone fractures. Deciduous vow reworks familiar renewal trope into seasonal legal contract—fresh angle. Risk is structural—quiet lyric closure instead of set-piece—but payoff lands. Slight echo of “mender” trope from recent fabulism keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>
