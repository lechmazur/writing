<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood memory surfaces as a sensory echo that physically tilts her weaving—but the “texture of connection” remains an abstract want. Her single decisive act (resuming the weave after the shadow-man’s warning) is credible, yet the felt cost is muted: we see thread tangled, not psyche frayed. The flaw is micro—therapeutic self-label (“she knew she had changed”)—but it lands in the closure beat, nudging down from 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gallery reset to “solid and unmoving” against Elara’s sharpened perception—conceptual cost is legible. Causal chain holds: weave → gallery erupts → memory intrusion → warning → resume → dissolve. One minor elasticity: “memories alter” is declared twice before any on-page memory appears, a soft causality hiccup, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive orientation penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gallery is not backdrop but reactive instrument: walls melt into color-rivers that tangle her feet, forcing a mid-weave pivot. Micro-setting (sinew thread) charges the final image—tangled mess = visible cost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she spots “fractured light” first, tactile thread last. One hedge: “unreal space” is repeated descriptor without fresh angle on third mention, a small drag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single stake—connection via weave—tightens when the shadow-man’s warning forecloses safety: “what if it unravels you?” Escalation is textural: each pattern intensifies gallery volatility until the environment literally dissolves; cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but still felt. No secondary reversal, yet the deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Could use one visceral consequence (blood on thread, dizzy spell) to hit 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not thesis: tangled thread = entangled identity. Final re-pricing—“the world felt sharper”—lets the reader decode connection as perceptual risk rather than moral. One near-miss: “texture of connection” is nearly prompt-echo, but it’s buried mid-paragraph and redeployed as tactile object, dodging heavy −0.8 sermon penalty. Subtle, effective, not quite electric enough for 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to sensorium: “she felt the shift in her chest” keeps psychic distance tight. Diction is fevered yet precise—“sinew thread,” “rational enchantment”—mirroring her architect mind. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, rhythmic; one template cadence runs (“she… she… she…”) across three openers, but it accidentally mimics loom rhythm—readable as pattern, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive: sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work in single strokes—“floor sprouted roots that coiled upward like living vines” shows environment, agency threat, and simile in one breath. No synonym loops; metaphors stay internally coherent. One mixed image: “light fractured into impossible angles” (angles don’t fracture) nicks −0.2. Otherwise clean, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fever-dream architect who weaves reality with animal-thread is fresh; trope of illusion-gallery is familiar but re-cast as responsive loom. Conceptual risk—rational enchantment—pays off when logic literally unravels the world. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No obvious pop-culture echo. Bold without gimmick; earns its lyric finish.</comment>
