<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“she let the image seep into her”), but her motives remain monolithic—no contradictory impulse ever threatens the mission. Actions align with the poetic wharf weaver label, yet the story never risks her perfection; no visible flaw complicates a stitch. The earned-stasis closure is credible because the cost is the lifelong devotion already spent, but we still witness only one emotional register.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: overlapping sleepwalking paths tighten into a cadence shift rather than causal reversals, and the final gallery glow is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (her exhaustion, the irreversible fusion of plate and stone). Orientation is taught early (“centuries-old labyrinth”, “tide pools emptied”), so the later lyric compression is legible. Closure lands cleanly, though the absence of a micro-turn keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, petrichor of “earth and time,” and the shifting illustrations on the metal plate are all tactile, POV-filtered, and finally constrain her last stitch—the glowing walls literally limit further passage. Spatial choreography is maintained through sleepwalking overlaps; no impossible positions. The micro-setting (plate as compass) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is declared early and finally achieved, but pressure stays flat; each corridor offers only more inspiration, never a narrowing option or visible trade-off. Escalation is textural (color seeping, corridors brightening) rather than a tightening choice. No credible loss or reversal complicates tactics, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: broken precedents become pigment, ruin becomes gallery, art as repair without moralizing. The orchid-solace motif is never named aloud; it accrues through the blooming colors in stone. Complexity is modest—no counter-argument that reverence might itself be another fragile precedent—so the resonance is pleasing rather than profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is consistently poetic—“orchid solace,” “nets that caught not fish but dreams”—yet syntactic rhythm stays controlled, never tipping into purple overload. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices texture, scent, and etched line above all, aligning with weaver/illustrator identity. No head-hopping or register drift; compression in peak beats (“labyrinth whispered its gratitude”) is earned by earlier pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density (“each pass, the illustrations…seemed to come alive”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors are avoided. One strained phrase (“gallery of orchid solace”) lightly bruises clarity, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fusion of sleepwalking cartography with textile restoration feels fresh; the illustration-plate-as-compass repurposes a static art object into kinetic map. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure taught early and paid off—though the core “art heals ruin” arc is familiar. Specificity of weaver-canyon synthesis keeps it from template territory.</comment>
