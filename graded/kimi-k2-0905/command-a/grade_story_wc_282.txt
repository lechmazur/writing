<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing stone, the fossil “warm to the touch”—but the arc is an observer’s journey: she registers wonder rather than fights contradictory impulses. The decisive moment (placing the fossil) is externally triggered by floating, not by a micro-choice that costs her something we watch her weigh. The “voice of the unknown” motive is announced, not dramatized under pressure; we never see her refuse an easier path. Competence is high, struggle low, so the reconfiguration feels bestowed, not earned.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new heat-map layer and fossil pulse thickens emotional density until the carvings ignite. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes into “storyteller”—but the cost is conceptual, not felt on-page; nothing is forfeited or foreclosed. Orientation is clear within 120 words, transitions are smooth, yet the pivot from data to myth relies on magical escalation rather than a because/therefore choice. The lens ambiguity cap does not apply, but the missing tangible price keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<comment>The cave is more than backdrop: salt-thick air and bioluminescent algae narrow perception and guide her deeper. The elm fossil functions as micro-setting—its warmth and rotation constrain her attention and literally steer her body to the hidden chamber. Spatial choreography is clean; the pedestal’s presence is pre-shadowed by the fossil’s hum. Environment passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image, though the broader “after-hibernation” world rule is only asserted, not tested through tactile limits.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“uncover forgotten history”—is declared early; pressure accumulates via pattern breaks in the heat-maps, not via narrowing options Elara must trade off. The fossil’s float is a coincidence that complicates; it never threatens loss or demands adaptation. The final beat reweights meaning but does not foreclose a live alternative; she gains purpose without paying a visible price. Under Accumulative lens this is sufficient for mild escalation, yet lacks the visible price required for 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—maps as bridge between worlds—emerges through imagery rather than thesis: maps shift from data to “promise for the future.” Subtext is thin; silence or gesture don’t complicate the meaning. The fossil-as-transitional-object idea is named, not dramatized through irony or contradictory desire. Final image is resonant but morally uncomplicated; ambiguity is present yet shallow.</comment>

<comment>Third-person narration maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature is attentive to texture (“damp earth,” “veins perfectly preserved”). Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “as if” clauses that mirror mapping’s speculative logic. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register drifts slightly elevated for a fieldworker (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) but stays within plausible interior lexicon of a mystic cartographer.</comment>

<comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“began to notice,” “began to see”) appears. Information density is moderate—some sentences serve only atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent: fossil “hum” and “pulse” extend the bio-mapper’s sensory metaphor set. The final third avoids artifacts, but earlier floating beats contain echoing participial openers that dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sensory map-making of emotional after-images in a post-hibernation cave is a fresh synthesis; the fossil-as-transitional-key gives the concept tactile spine. Tropes (ancient chamber, glowing carvings) are familiar, but filtered through data-driven mysticism. Transformation test: remove “heat-map” and the entire logic collapses, proving integration. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids gimmick but also stops short of radical formal daring.</comment>
