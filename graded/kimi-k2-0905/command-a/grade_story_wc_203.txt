<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s “peculiar gift” is asserted, not embodied; the ghosts cue him but never complicate his choices. Interiority stays generic (“weightless burden,” “sense of closure”) rather than conflicted. The decisive act—inserting the barrel—mirrors the ghosts’ prompt exactly, so no contradictory impulse or visible cost is legued. No relationship or status crucible on stage; the ghosts serve as chorus, not pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: ghost whisper → find barrel → dust pattern → ceiling clock → insert → heal cracks. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking clock re-weights the stake (“counting down to a future he couldn’t yet see”) with felt cost. No Orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One micro-turn (ceiling becomes live clock) suffices for this length. No lens ambiguity; drive stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting dominates: the brass barrel and the cracked clock become the tactile environment that constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marcus’s technician eye—dust thickness, brass tarnish, gear fit—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: counter ascent, tile lift, barrel insertion. Final image (ticking clock in healed ceiling) recharges the “cracks” motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—is signaled early. One tightening: ceiling void reveals clock; inserting barrel forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (future now ticks unpredictably) rather than visceral; still legible on final line. Escalation is singular but coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair vs. irreversible time emerges through the barrel-clock fusion; no moralizing statement. “Cracks always reappear” offers plausible ambiguity—healing is temporary, future uncertain. Subtext lives in gesture (girl’s finger upward) rather than label. Final image reweights premise without sermon; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus; perceptual signature is technician-filtered (dust patterns, gear fit). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Diction stable, slight register lift in “resonant reconfiguration” phrases but within plausible repair-tech lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“His fingers traced the intricate engravings” = tactile detail + character expertise). No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary. Figurative language sparse and apt (“facade now a crumbling reminder”). One mixed metaphor flagged: “weightless burden” is abstract cliché, but isolated. Closure line is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + ghost-whisperer + horological resurrection. Circus setting mostly atmospheric, but clock-barrel fusion feels specific to this voice. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent resolution; coherence preserved. Not fully transformative—haunted-venue trope familiar—but barrel-as-heart twist recharges it.</comment>
