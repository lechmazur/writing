<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's quiet witnessing feels lived-in; her decision to gift the notebook is a micro-choice that crystallizes her ethos. The widow's tearful offering of her own carpet thread shows a credible shift from frozen waiting to acknowledgment. Both characters remain in emotional surplus: we see contradictory impulses (hope vs. recognition of loss) acted out in real time. The only bar to 9-band is that the widow's turn is slightly smoothed by the traveler's near-perfect attunement—no visible misstep complicates the intimacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, orientation locked before word 120; causal chain is interior but tight—because the traveler witnesses, therefore the widow releases the thread, therefore both women exit the garden reconfigured. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the widow's life path is not physically changed, yet the obituary read aloud forecloses her identity as "the one who waits," and the traveler leaves with doubled thread-cost palpable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of thread, garden shadow, and ship afterglow accumulate until the final image reweights meaning. No artifact touches the cadence of the hymn-like reading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden is not backdrop but active filter: falling light narrows visual field, crunching leaves mark the traveler's intrusion, bench placement dictates the forced physical intimacy that pressures confession. Autumn air and woodsmoke scent are returned to in the final line, recharging the "lonesome splendor" motif. Spatial choreography is flawless—distance between bench and trees stays constant, thread hand-off is tactile. Micro-setting (the two carpet threads) functions as portable geography that constrains the closing gesture; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the widow relinquish the identity of waiting? Pressure escalates through accumulative repetition of ship-afterglow and garden quiet until the obituary reading forces a public re-labeling. The traveler's agency is minimal but sufficient—her steady presence is the lever; the widow's tear is the visible cost that forecloses further nightly vigils. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is tested and paid on-page.</comment>

<comment>Theme of "absence as geography" emerges solely through concrete map-making: garden paths, horizon line, and the invisible map the widow draws with her gaze. No character ever names the theme; the final image of twin threads reweights the concept without abstraction. Subtext lives in gesture—thread exchange is more articulate than any dialogue about grief. Final line's "tiny obituaries for the day" offers Conceptual Repricing of dusk itself, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice is steady, modest, slightly archaic ("lonesome splendor") yet never purple. Rhythm lengthens and contracts with the widow's breathing; syntactic parallelism in the obituary passage mirrors liturgy, teaching the pattern early and paying off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tied to traveler's tactile noticing (crunch, scent, thread weight). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated ("she began to observe").</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image ("tiny obituaries") that recharges prior motifs. One tiny register lift—"geometry of healing"—but it is the traveler's private idiom, justified by her vocation.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise of writing obituaries for the living is fresh, but the garden vigil and thread talisman are familiar tropes; specificity comes from the accretion of sensory garden detail and the obituary's precise wording. Risk is quiet—no twist, no formal rupture—yet the emotional reconfiguration feels inevitable. Transformation test passes: swap setting or threads and the emotional calculus collapses. Slight deduction for low-temperature risk.</comment>
