<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral—her fingers “tracing the creases as if they held answers” embodies grief in motion—but the drone-strike backstory is delivered in two chunked info-drops that stall present pressure. The micro-choice to crawl for the photo is credible, yet the shift from freeze to artistic renewal feels telescoped; we leap from survival reflex to sketchbook without witnessing the intermediate contradiction that would make the renunciation costly. Still, her body-under-stress notes ring true and the final sketch is a believable reclamation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sketchpad left on bench + photo in pocket reconfigure her stance from fleeing memory to curating it—an Earned Stasis with felt opportunity cost. Causal lens holds: slip → freeze → sketch is a because/therefore chain; no coincidence rescues her. The photograph’s flutter off the cliff is a crisp external turn that tightens the stake to “retrieve or lose the last link.” Orientation is anchored by scent + location within 60 words; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arboretum-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: the secluded bench is discovered only because the paths “wind like veins,” letting her pivot from peril to art without leaving the scene. Salt-wind jasmine and “waves crashed against the rocks” are filtered through trauma-narrowed attention—smell and sound override visual catalog. Spatial track is immaculate: photo at cliff-edge, loose stone, sketchpad on bench—no floating props. Environment mirrors internal shift without emblematic over-signing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the photo or let grief win”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalated when wind + cliff threaten to finish the drone’s erasure. The slip forces a literal freeze that converts survival reflex into creative act, narrowing future options to “carry memory as art.” Cost is visible: she forsakes immediate flight-safety to crawl toward the void, then forsakes privacy by leaving the sketch behind—two tangible prices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “stillness earned inside perpetual motion” (ocean, wind, trauma) without moralizing. The photograph’s transformation from fragile relic to sketched permanence reweights meaning; the pearl image recurs only once, preventing token motif fatigue. Subtext resides in gesture: leaving the sketch public = silent declaration that her witness will outlast her fear. Insight is earned through physical risk rather than narrated epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is trauma-angled—“salt carried the scent of… memories that haunted” privileges olfactory hyper-vigilance over visual panorama. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then fractures into clipped clauses during the slip—“time seemed to stand still”—mirroring cardiac slowdown of somatic freeze. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; only minor scaffold: “a stark contrast to the memories that haunted Zara” is abstract summary that could be cut. Metaphors (“fluttered like a wounded bird”) are singular and apt; no mixed-vehicle pile-ups. One paraphrase loop—“the world that had since shattered / a world that had since shattered”—is repeated concept within two sentences, costing −0.2. Closure sentence sails without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drone-strike survivor meets coastal arboretum is a fresh juxtaposition; lighthouse-keeper myth is understated world-building that avoids trope checklist. The freeze-to-art pivot converts a physiological trauma response into creative reclamation—an inversion of typical “frozen = helpless” arc. Specificity of jasmine-salt air and vein-like paths keeps the combo from feeling grafted. Risk is moderate but successful; no derivative echo of famous scenes.</comment>
