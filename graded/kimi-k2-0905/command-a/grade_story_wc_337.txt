<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and vocation are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions—“lucid unrest,” “accumulated silence”—that short-circuit contradictory impulse. The final beat of self-mending is signaled, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that visibly costs her anything in the moment the last knot gives. Earned Stasis is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the slack net and lifted hush reconfigure meaning with cost legible in the image. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each unraveled knot intensifies spectral density until the stillness flips. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “her hands moved with practiced ease, but her mind was elsewhere” restates the same beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prism sanctuary, stained glass starlight, and the fraying net create a tactile micro-setting that constrains gesture and focus. The net’s fibers, salt scent, and needle glint are filtered through restorer’s gaze, guiding every tactical motion. Final image of loosened threads refracts earlier color into lighter silence—setting charges closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the spirits—tightens as each knot refusal raises spectral resistance; Accumulative escalation is coherent. One meaningful deepening: the stubborn penultimate knot forces Elara to whisper plea, revealing her own need for grounding. Cost is felt in the sagging net and her trembling hands; options narrow from restoration to communion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending the broken by surrendering to their stories emerges through image, not thesis. Net-to-mask parallel is implicit; final prismatic path light reweights earlier shards without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure yet stays coherent—grief is carried, not cured. One soft echo: “mending herself” is slightly overt in last paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors glints, fray, salt, hush—restorer’s sensory lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped fragments during knot resistance. No head-hopping; free indirect clean. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay physical (saltwater, glass, thread). One mixed vehicle: “silence…accumulated with every passing moment” treats silence as countable mass, but context absorbs it. Peak beat clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mask-restorer exhuming ghost-knots from fisherman’s net is fresh synthesis of maritime grief and craft. Prism sanctuary refracts familiar starlight trope into specific occupational lens. Risk lies in quiet ending—stakes internalized—but pattern holds. Could swap mother-storm backstory with any loss; slight generic tint keeps it from higher band.</comment>
