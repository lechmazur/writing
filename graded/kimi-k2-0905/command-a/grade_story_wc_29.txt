<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “tracing constellations,” her gaze “hardening”—and her micro-choice to weaponize the subwoofer grows from established competence. Yet the “cosmic tricksters” remain an abstract foil; their motives never press her blind spots, so the endured cost feels intellectual rather than personal. Still, the refusal to block (amplify) the signal crystallizes a believable stance and forecloses sponsorship salvation with visible fallout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: signal → decode → counter-frequency → social fracture. Orientation is clean by word 60; the single-scene default is met. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the station stays hers, the cost is the widening campus rift announced outside the window—felt, not declared. No teleporting props; charts and subwoofer track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The radio station is evoked through tactile micro-setting—vintage mics, tangled wires, concrete floor boots—each detail filtering Elara’s prioritization of obsolete tech as weapon. Charts re-enter as handled objects that guide calibration, not backdrop. The final “ethereal glow” mirrors her fragile win without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography survives the single-room motion; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the station and her agency—tightens when sponsor flight is spelled; the counter-frequency act narrows her options to pariah status. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens: each because/therefore step raises social cost. No coincidence rescues; campus protests complicate, not solve. Price is visible: static silence bought with community schism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of human ingenuity vs. unknowable manipulation emerges through Elara’s instrumentalized science rather than exposition. Subtext lives in Hank’s clipboard and the silent subwoofer vibration—institutional commerce vs. intuitive code. Final image reframes the charts as battle maps, not star-maps, reweighting wonder into wary vigilance. Avoids sermon; no final-paragraph thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature—“celestial signal interpreter”—colors every noticing with spectrograph jargon that never drifts into lay condescension. Rhythm accelerates into staccato clauses during activation beat, then exhales, mirroring signal distortion. Dialogue from Hank is utilitarian, contrasting her elliptical interior voice without convergence. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “stack of astronomical charts” doubles as visual and character tool in five words. Mixed metaphors are absent; “universe was full of tricksters” is abstract but immediately re-grounded via subwoofer mechanics. No template cadence or synonym loops. One minor scaffold: “the signal wasn’t random—it was structured” could compress, but it occurs early and does not dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar SETI trope is refreshed by casting a campus radio shack as frontline defense and subsonic hijack as weapon. Trickster cosmos rather than benevolent aliens re-weights genre presumption. Stakes stay local—one woman’s mixing board versus lost sponsorship—eschewing telescopic save-the-planet inflation. Specificity of outdated gear and sponsor clipboard makes the permutation memorable.</comment>
