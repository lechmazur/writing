<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically voiced—“driftingly alert” is a lovely idiosyncrasy—but her decisions are reported rather than dramatized (“she realized,” “she began to encode”) so we witness no contradictory impulses under live pressure. The bolt-plate handling is abstract; we’re told it feels like a key rather than seeing her fingers mis-thread a gear or risk a short that would force adaptation. Ghost-contact is summarized, not embodied, so the climactic hand-clasp lacks a visible cost on her body or future choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost achieves coherence and Elara’s vocation reframes from unheard balladeer to voice-giver. The “between lightning and thunder” rule is taught early and charges the final bolt-plate encoding, so the causal lens holds. However, the middle is episodic—graffiti appears, device hums—without because/therefore links that tighten options; escalation relies on atmospheric accretion rather than irreversible turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-courtyard above clouds is anchored by line 3 and continuously filters perception—“air shimmered with distant lightning” keeps spatial limits alive. The bolt plate serves as micro-setting: its etched patterns pulse, guiding her tuning and later encoding. Weather and altitude affect action—storm mist limits visibility and times the encoding window—so environment constrains tactics and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes—free the ghost / prove her own voice—are signaled early but remain abstract; no tangible resource (time, lute string, battery) is risked or lost. Pressure rises atmospherically rather than through narrowed choices; the graffiti and plate cooperate too smoothly, so options don’t foreclose. Cost is spiritual, not on-page; the ghost’s gratitude is felt but Elara forfeits nothing visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—giving voice to the voiceless—emerges through Elara’s mirrored exile and the ghost’s code-entrapment rather than overt statement. The final stardust dissolve offers a non-literal reconfiguration of her vocation. Avoids sermon, but lyric repetition of “tinkersong wonder” edges toward label-speak, slightly thinning subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium with rhythmic cadence—“weaving tales of forgotten realms and lost loves” carries balladeer idiom. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices sound, shimmer, etched light. Diction is elevated but fits mythic tone; no register drift under pressure. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is musical, with clause-length variation that mimics lute phrasing; no template cadence detected. Figurative strings—“spectral presence,” “stardust on the wind”—cluster but stay coherent to ghost/transcendence motif, not muddled. Information density high: each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold: “She had found it… its purpose long forgotten” could compress, but it doesn’t stall the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing graffiti, bolt-plate steampunk, and cloud-courtyard myth is fresh; the ghost-in-code trope is familiar yet retuned through bardic song-as-interface. Specificity—“flower press bolt plate,” “tinkersong wonder”—prevents generic swap. Conceptual commitment total: no retreat to safer realism. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meeting transformation test.</comment>
