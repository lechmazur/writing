<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is serviceable but leans on stock phrases (“her heart full”) and tidy emotional labels; the contradictory impulses needed for 9+ are asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. Her moment of private cost is displaced into group catharsis, so the renunciation/readiness beat feels second-hand. Still, her sung micro-choices do drive the gears and the crowd shift, keeping her north of functional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: the town’s collective voice reconfigures the broken social clock and Elara’s next song is fore-closed with fatigue. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the multilingual song layers until the mechanism and crowd “reply.” The price (Elara’s spent voice, the town’s exposed memory) is legible in the final paragraph, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but the prior escalation is more tableau than tightening, keeping it in the low 8s band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anchor triad is clear by line 3; starlit cobblestones, brass weight, and oil-scented air are selective and POV-filtered. The clock tower doubles as micro-setting that constrains her climb and later frames the communal resonance. Sensory economy is strong; the only drag is one tourist-catalog line (“its intricate face gleaming”) that could compress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair fractured community speech—is signaled early. Escalation arrives as the song’s multilingual layering forces first the gears, then the crowd to answer, narrowing Elara’s option to keep singing past exhaustion. Cost is visible (her tears, Kovar’s cracked silence) but the pressure plateaus rather than deepens after the first chime; a second tightening is missing for 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: shared polyglot memory as antidote to siloed identity. The astronomical clock’s re-animation reframes time as communal, not mechanical, avoiding overt thesis statements. Final image of “bridges stretched endlessly” risks slight thematic echo but is saved by its sunrise physicality and Elara’s hoarse breath, giving it earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s choral ear; Latin/German fragments carry her perceptual signature. Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses during the climb, staccato fragments when gears catch—without losing clarity. One register drift (“symbol of her mission”) sounds editorial; otherwise voice control is confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Prose is largely clean: high density, no loops, strong verbs. Metaphors are restrained; “borrowed starlight” recurs but pays off at dawn. Only minor scaffold: “the town...now spoke in fragmented dialects” tells what the song later shows, trimming one clause would tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Fusing astronomical clock tower with multilingual choral rehab is a fresh angle on the tired “music heals” trope. Specificity of grain-elevator memories keeps it from abstraction. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids gimmick but doesn’t push form, keeping it sub-9.</comment>
