<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—hope vs. doubt—are dramatized in real time as she plants, prunes, and tastes; the final choice to share the fruit is earned by her overnight labor and the visible cost of exhaustion. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic: “She knew planting it here… was risky.” Flaw (stubborn idealism) complicates action and remains unresolved, supplying credible cost. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the image of glowing fruit ready to leave the greenhouse reconfigures the world’s possibilities with undeniable conceptual cost—Elara will now be the carrier of inconvenient wisdom. Causal chain holds: seed → celestial trigger → synaptic memories → fruit → shared future. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and again at transition to dawn. No lens ambiguity; the piece ends under Causal drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop; its twisted frame and scent of rain constrain Elara’s pacing, supply pruning tools, and absorb starlight that literally feeds the plant. Micro-setting (terra-cotta pot, cracked soil) doubles as crucible for her fingers and memories. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → plant → sit → prune → stand → pluck. Final image of “glowing orbs” reuses the setting’s metallic gleam, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wake the world to nurturing—signals early and tightens once: the sprout races skyward, forcing her to decide whether to trust the fruit or destroy it. Escalation is driven by her agency (pruning debris, staying awake) under Causal lens; celestial coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible: dirt-under-nails fatigue, fear of silence. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “creating beauty from ruins” is enacted, not named, through soil, rust, and shared taste. Subtext lives in gesture—pruning vines becomes pruning fear. Final image reweights the premise: knowledge is no longer hoarded but distributed, reframing prior decay as compost. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in how the world will receive the fruit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias—she “tastes” wind and starlight, reads scars as warrior markings. Syntax modulates: longer, soil-heavy sentences in calm, clipped fragments under dawn pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Free-indirect “she knew planting here was risky” keeps psychic distance tight. Diction never drifts above her culinary-earth lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths swell and contract with night→dawn arc. Sentences do dual duty—“the greenhouse seemed to hum” advances both atmosphere and plant magic. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold trace: “she knew… she knew…” repeated opening in adjacent lines (−0.2). Closure image is uncluttered, letting “glowing orbs” land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-tasting chef + synaptic botany + celestial alignment into an inevitable micro-myth; removing any node collapses the logic. Transformation test passes: this exact woman, ruin, and seed must intersect. Risk—quiet lyric rebellion instead of epic battle—heightens coherence without gimmick. Fresh inflection: pruning as neural/cultural metaphor feels newly minted, not grafted.</comment>
