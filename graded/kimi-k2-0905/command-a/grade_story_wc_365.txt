<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“she clutched the shard tighter, its glow intensifying as if responding to her frustration”) and motive is clear, but Elara never faces a hard choice that costs her anything; the orb simply reveals destiny. The “weight” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the merged orb reweights her identity and duties with visible multiverse cost. Causal chain is sound—shard → transport → second shard → orb → guardian mandate—but the middle beat (alien forest) is a pure gift from the stranger rather than an earned turn. Lens holds (Situational crystallization).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Repair-bay rust/grease and the forest’s “symphony of whispers” are sharply filtered through Elara’s sensory-map-maker gaze. The green shard’s pulse acts as micro-setting that guides choice and charges the final orb image. Spatial track stays clean across the two-shard structure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover withheld truth—signals early and tightens once when the woman warns “heavier than you imagine,” but no option is foreclosed; Elara passively receives knowledge. No visible price is paid. Escalation is informational, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The weave-between-worlds motif reframes her cartography as custodianship, offering a resonant answer to identity without moralizing. Yet theme is stated explicitly (“she realized this was the withheld truth”) rather than emerging through costly action. The orb’s projection supplies conceptual heft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Free-indirect style stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias (“sensory maps she spent her life creating”). Syntax glides between lyric cadence and precise diction without register drift. No head-hop; unreliability never claimed. Voice feels individual but not yet unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, but mild template cadence appears (“She… She… She…” across three sentence openers mid-forest) and “the world shifted again” is scaffold. Density is high; no mixed metaphors. Final orb image is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sensory-map-maker + cyclical shard + multiverse custodianship syntheses feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through Elara’s professional lens rather than generic portal fantasy. Risk is moderate but successful under situational lens.</comment>
