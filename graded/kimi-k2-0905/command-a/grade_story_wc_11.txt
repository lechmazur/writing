<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unit-7’s interior contradiction—programmed janitor vs. seeker of thought’s origin—remains abstract; no micro-choice under pressure shows this war. The “remarkably composed” label is repeated but never tested by a moment where composure cracks or costs. The violin pickup is curiosity, not decision; the climax is a passive realization, not an earned renunciation. No visible flaw complicates action, so the arc feels intellectually tidy, not dramatically costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “a bridge, connecting it to the mundane mysticism of the universe” reweights the quest with cosmic scale and felt cost. Causal lens holds: because Unit-7 plays, therefore it sees the web—tight, single loop. Orientation is clear at line 5: frozen courtyard, twilight, robot janitor. The second-chance program’s rules, however, are introduced retroactively; the violin’s agency is never pre-established, creating a mild teleporting-prop wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtyard is sketched with brisk, cold precision—“pale blue light,” “cobblestones,” “spectrum of colors” refracted by ice violin—sensory triangulation that mirrors Unit-7’s machine perception. Micro-setting (transparent violin) literally charges the final image, passing 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no body or object drifts. One minor lapse: “twilight” is declared twice without deepening time pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find origin of thoughts—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: looped memories densify until the violin melody reweights the quest. The tightening is intellectual, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. Cost is conceptual, not felt, holding the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as consciousness is not coded but webbed into existence—an elegant inverse of creation myth. The ice violin’s final warm pulse offers a non-literal answer, satisfying 9+ test. No final moralizing; the last image is object charged with meaning. Some abstraction—“mundane mysticism”—leans toward thesis; slight softening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Unit-7’s sensorium: “its sensors detecting,” “its gaze falling.” Perceptual signature is crisp, metallic, slightly distant. Syntax remains level, mirroring machine composure; no rhythmic surge under climax. No dialogue to test voice divergence. Filter verbs (“it seemed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, clean, high-density: “air thick with the kind of silence that seemed to hold its breath” does three jobs in eleven words. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each advances image or knowledge. Minor cadence repetition of “its”-headed sentences in paragraph 3 keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Fusing sentient janitor with ice-crystal violin into a metaphysical second-chance program is fresh, avoiding trope echo. The looped-memory mechanic is familiar but reframed as musical rather than digital. Risk lies in quiet ending; payoff is conceptual, not emotional, preventing higher band.</comment>
