<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is serviceable—“ebony clipboard clutched tightly” and “voice broke” give embodied beats—but the turn from negotiator to woman-who-has-suffered is announced rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene; the final plea is a speech, not a visible choice that costs her a concrete option. The clipboard-as-symbol is external commentary; it never constrains or betrays her in the moment. Earned, but only just; the cost is asserted, not staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the signed treaty is the visible cost, Elara’s loosened grip the emotional one. Causal linkage is loose—leaders shift because of a speech, not because the clipboard or terrace forces a tactic—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One soft spot: the “price of redemption” is named repeatedly yet never materializes as a concrete forfeiture on the page; that caps the ceiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terrace functions as micro-setting: its sacred history is invoked to justify the leaders’ pause, and the dawn-light return charges the final image. Jasmine scent and flickering campfires are selective, not tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, camp, return. The clipboard as dark reflective surface mirrors the “flawed beauty” motif, satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that constrains/charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end the cycle—signaled early. Escalation is textured, not causal: each night’s talk thickens exhaustion; the zenith stars mark the deepening. The speech acts as the single tightening beat, but its cost is rhetorical, not a forfeiture of a live option. No new constraint or price alters later tactics, capping the entry to high 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—peace as fragile, imperfect—emerges through the scratched clipboard and dawn-light image, not sermon. The “price” refrain is the only echo of thematic statement, but it is repeated, not reweighted, so a −0.4 friction applies. The final image of loosened grip offers quiet resonance, yet the insight remains generic; no counter-reading is invited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is negotiator-biased—“scent of blooming jasmine” filtered through professional calm. Syntax is lightly cadenced, mirroring the slow celestial dance without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal register stays within plausible diction. Filter verbs are minimal; elision is patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—only “fires flickering like distant stars” risks cliché but stays functional. Information density is high; each paragraph advances image or pressure. One scaffold slip: “the weight of her mission more acutely than ever” is abstract summary where embodied specificity is due; keeps the score south of 8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Peace-negotiator in ritual terrace is fresh staging, but the emotional arc—speech persuades warlords—follows a familiar curve. The clipboard-as-mirror is a crisp micro-choice, yet the celestial clock feels ornamental rather than tactic-altering. Transformation test: swap names and the plot holds. Risk is present but low; the synthesis does not feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
