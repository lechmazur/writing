<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tapping ritual and reef grief feel lived-in—but the atlas page arrives as pure externality; she never actively chooses to interrogate it, only “begins to assemble fragments.” The epiphany is therefore narrated rather than earned by a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The “why paths disappear” motive stays abstract; no contradictory impulse (e.g., fear of learning complicity) is dramatized under pressure. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to keep characterization in the high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the coastline is re-priced as a site of original sin, and the atlas page’s torn edge becomes the visible cost of willful amnesia. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each reef datum, tap rhythm, and atlas symbol layers until the final image reweights the stakes. The piece teaches its pattern early and lands the charge cleanly. A 0.4 deduction because the decisive tightening—her realization—arrives in exposition rather than dramatized action; we are told she “realized,” not shown her body register the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station is sketched with salty economy—“weathered metal frame,” “hummed with automated systems”—and the atlas page’s frayed edge is tactile enough to serve as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is flawless; the page is handled, flipped, spread on the floor, constraining her posture and attention. The vanished coastline is never physically entered, but its absence is made present through the watermark symbol that steers the final reconfiguration. One hairline slip: “periodically eternal” is asserted rather than grounded in sensory evidence of that cyclicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>The dominant stake—will Elara confront the buried origin of ecological loss—tightens once, when the watermark clicks the atlas page into alignment with her reef data. The cost is conceptual but legible: the coastline was not just erased by water but by human extraction, implicating her own witnessing project. Agency is oblique—she pieces together rather than acts outward—consistent with Accumulative escalation. A 0.3 deduction because the tightening beat is delivered in reflective summary rather than a visible choice that forecloses an option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the torn page literalizes selective memory, and the final image—coastline as original wound—reweights “why paths disappear” into a warning that forgetting is a form of continued extraction. No overt thesis is stated; insight arrives through the object’s charged return. The refrain of “periodically eternal” risks echo territory but is saved by its last-sentence inversion: human blindness, not ocean rhythm, is the eternal recurrence. Ambiguity lingers—no moral balance-sheet—so the resonance feels earned rather than asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is marine-biologist precise—“contours erased by time and rising tides”—yet salted with grief. Tapping rhythms create a percussive motif that graduates from nervous habit to epistemic method, then to funeral drum. Psychic distance holds tight third; no filter-verb bloat. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer reflective rolls contract into staccato realizations, mirroring her cognitive assembly. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained under pressure; elision is minimal and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, no loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and exact—“sentinel against the horizon” stands without clutter. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive. Register stays within a scientist’s diction; no corporate drift. One Clause-packed sentence mid-epiphany could breathe more, but it does not touch the closure beat. Typos, tense, pronoun reference immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of coral grief + obsolete cartography feels inevitable yet fresh; the atlas page as palimpsest of extraction guilt is a non-obvious leap. Risk is taken by letting escalation accumulate through research fragments rather than external jeopardy, and it pays off in conceptual repricing. The “periodically eternal” angle could have slid into pseudo-profundity but is grounded in the specific watermark symbol. No close echoes of famous eco-fiction set-pieces; the piece owns its quiet apocalypse.</comment>
