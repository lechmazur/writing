<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s mute endurance and final piano choice crystallize a believable arc from passive watcher to active keeper of truth. Interiority is sparse but embodied: trembling fingers, bolt heavy in pocket, hesitant notes. The “cost of safety” motive remains abstract—never pressured by an on-scene test—so the shift to hope feels more declared than earned. Still, the micro-choice to play lands as a visible renunciation of silence, satisfying the 9- gate for contradictory impulse in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is clean: bolt-touch → conceptual repricing of silence as fear, piano chord as earned stasis. Causality is accumulative/textural: stained step teaches pattern early, bolt reprise reweights meaning. Cost is legible—“the bolt now… heavy with knowledge”—and final image forecloses pure silence. One minor loop: “silence” is repeated 7× in 70 words, dulling cadence, but does not break lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt light, snow blanket, yellowed keys, rusted bolt—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s hush-biased attention. The fortress functions less as architecture than mood engine: corridors absorb sound, piano bench forces posture. Spatial choreography is crisp: staircase ascent → hidden door → pedestal. Environment never physically constrains choice, so misses 9+ gate, but charges the final image with color temperature that mirrors the frostbitten hope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“price of tranquility vs. chaos”—is signaled early and tightened once: piano chord breaks unpardonable silence, renouncing absolute safety. No credible loss is dramatized (no guard chases, no exile threat), so cost stays conceptual. Escalation is textural: density of silence metaphors increases until pattern snaps into sound. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but lacks a visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of silence-as-fear without sermonizing. Bolt’s transformation from relic to essence-carrier reconfigures the moral calculus: safety bought by self-imprisonment. Final non-literal answer—music as frostbitten hope—reweights prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias guardian or collaborator? Complexity intact, no tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is hush-filtered, synesthetic (cobalt light tastes cold). Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for silence, staccato fragments when fingers hover. No dialogue, so voice carries entire load. One filter-verb cluster (“he noticed… he saw… he understood”) in climax beat costs −0.2, else 8.4.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional tempo; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No loops or synonym churn; “silence” repetition is thematic, not scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“notes… frostbitten hope”—but stays legible. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-action. Clean grammar, strong verbs, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silent-choir bellhop is fresh; bolt-as-linchpin-of-silence is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual alchemy: bolt = fortress = fear = cost. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off. Loses 0.2 for near-echoes of “stillness that absorbs sound” trope from modernist fortress tales.</comment>
