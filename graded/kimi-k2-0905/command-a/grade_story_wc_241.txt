<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and curiosity are vivid, but her decisions remain internal; the notebook write-out is the first concrete micro-choice and it lands too late to test her stated motive under pressure. Interiority is rich yet loops on abstract labels (“clover melancholy,” “theoretically rebellious”) without embodied contradiction in scene. The filial stake is clear, but the story withholds any external test or sacrifice that would foreclose a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final notebook moment reweights the subway-scrawl premise and leaves the next move legible yet unsettled. Causality is soft—accumulative/textural rather than strict because/therefore—but the pattern is taught early and holds. The single-scene orientation is clean; library anchors arrive by ~80 words. Cost is conceptual (inheritance of unanswerable questions) rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not acute.</comment>

<comment>Rainwashed stone, mica lantern light, and scent of old books are selective and POV-filtered; the lantern’s refracted pattern literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable—aisles, window, table—without white-room drift. Weather stays external ornament; it never constrains choice or resource. Micro-setting (notebook, lantern pane) does the heavy lifting, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding her father—signals early; pressure tightens only narratively (“she realized…”) rather than through an on-page obstacle or trade-off. No reversal or resource lost; escalation is atmospheric. The final write-out crystallizes stance but does not foreclose a live option or incur visible price. Sufficient for a quiet lyric arc, yet below the 8.2 threshold where cost would charge the image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “lucid contradictions” emerges through lantern imagery and subway riddles rather than authorial thesis. Subtext operates in silence and refracted light, avoiding final moral. The concept reweights at closure when Elara embraces unanswered questions, offering modest resonance. Complexity is present but not sharp-edged; ambiguity lingers without painful counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with perceptual signature in probability-flavored metaphors and library-filtered attention. Rhythm is controlled, sentences lengthening slightly under reflection, compressing at the final line. No dialogue to test. Diction stays within Elara’s educated lexicon; occasional lyric lift (“clover melancholy”) is earned by prior pattern. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid clutter. One paraphrase loop (“the way he had gambled…”) and one stock phrase (“like a river breaking through a dam”) slightly dull momentum. No scaffolding or synonym churn in peak beats. Copy is polished; pronoun and tense stable. Meets high-band technical bar but not immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Father-professor-gambler + subway-scrawl divination is a fresh synthesis; the lantern-mica refraction as metaphor for probabilistic uncertainty is specific and memorable. Risk level is moderate—quiet interior arc in a single location. The piece avoids stock grief tropes, but the core move (writing to understand) is familiar. Transformation is gentle: story would change if Elara’s method or object were swapped, yet emotional aftertaste is moderate.</comment>
