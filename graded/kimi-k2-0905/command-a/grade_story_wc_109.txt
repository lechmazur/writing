<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The oracle’s obsession is declared (“singular: to draw a map of an endless night”) but is never tested by an external obstacle or a costly choice; interiority stays abstract (“eyes gleamed with quiet intensity”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the mild obsession remains a label. The final smile registers as a static beat rather than an earned stance with price. Because the character neither loses nor renounces anything visible, the arc feels stalled at the level of premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the oracle freezes in a private smile while the last star dies, reweighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—silence and darkness accrue until the night becomes total. Cost is implied (the oracle stands alone in absolute dark), yet the lens is taught late and the price is off-stage rather than viscerally felt. Causality is loose—stories are recounted rather than causally linked to the oracle’s changing options—so the tightening is cadence-based, not consequential. The ending satisfies the lyric requirement but lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push it into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, flaking booklet, and tapering starlight are vividly sketched through sensory selectivity (“weathered stones absorbing the fury,” “pages crackling like dried leaves”). Description is woven into action (oracle opens the booklet, walks to the edge) so setting never stalls momentum. The fort functions as micro-setting—its ambered hush is the container that absorbs silence—charging the final image. While no prop physically constrains choice, the booklet’s self-turning pages give a subtle fantastic edge that reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture darkness forever—is clear early, but pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; the oracle never faces a live fork or visible price. Escalation is an accumulation of static tales whose silences deepen mood yet do not narrow the oracle’s options. The “last star” functions as symbolic clock, not a deadline that forces a decision. Without a beat where failure or loss looms, the conflict remains decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme—night as unending, silence as cartography—emerges through recurring images rather than statement. The final smile and vanished star reconfigure the quest as self-immolation in darkness, offering modest resonance. Yet the oracle’s personal stake (childhood dream) is summarized, not dramatized, so the thematic cost feels second-hand. Ambiguity lingers, but the absence of a concrete emotional price keeps the aftereffect light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to oracle perception; diction is consistent, slightly elevated but plausible for a mystic. Rhythm modulates with sentence length, mirroring the hush without drum-beat monotony. Perceptual signature is present—oracle notices silence, flaking gold, star extinction—though not razor-distinct. No dialogue, so no voice collision; the narrative voice achieves a poised, incantatory texture that supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; figurative language (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) repeats twice but reads as deliberate motif rather than synonym churn. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy is preserved. Occasional abstraction (“weight of centuries”) flirts with generality yet stays within voice. No artifacts touch the closing beat, sustaining momentum to the last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit—mapping night by telling silence—is fresh and specific, synthesizing familiar oracle + darkness tropes into a new cognitive act. The booklet that turns its own pages and the star-extinction clock supply subtle fantastic rules rather than generic props. Risk is quiet—no twist or pyrotechnics—yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Strong conceptual integrity lifts the score into the low 8-band despite low external stakes.</comment>
