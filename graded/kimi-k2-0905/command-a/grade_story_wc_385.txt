<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to understand “why some people echo” is clear, but the interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“reed-blown melancholy”) rather than concrete contradiction. She makes only one micro-choice—kneeling at the pool—and even that is obedient rather than volitional. The seashell warms, but she never actively tests or misuses it; the cost is observational, not paid. Earned Stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pool reweights her premise, showing echoes are deliberate cosmic threads. Cost is present—“quiet resolve” replacing melancholy—but it is felt conceptually, not bodily. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the echo motif intensifies through sensory refrains (“universe hummed”) and charges the final image. Missing early orientation—no concrete anchor of where or how time passes until ~140 words—would trigger −0.3, waived because disorientation pays off in the starlit dissolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Serpentine nexus under starlight” is a macro-setting; its topology never constrains movement or resource. Micro-setting rescue arrives via the seashell: its warming guides her stop and kneel, altering tactics. Sensory economy favors sound and touch—echoed song, “pulse of the cosmos”—but visual domain dominates. The final image reuses the ambient hum, recharging the nexus as emotional backdrop; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why people echo—signaled early and held. Escalation is accumulative: mirrored memories in the pool deepen texture rather than narrow options; no live trade-off or forfeiture appears. Agency is attention-based (gaze into pool) but passive; pressure is observational. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the echo metaphor: human lives as deliberate cosmic reverberations. No explicit thesis; final image of Elara singing “along” lets resonance stand in for moral. Subtext operates in silence—walls “seemed to listen”—rather than explanatory dialogue. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, but insight remains slightly abstract, capping ascent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person floats close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors sonic metaphors (“whispering seashell,” “haunting melody”) and cosmic scale. Syntax is elevated but consistent; no head-hop. Compression in peak beat—“the image shifted”—is clean, though register flirts with profundity: starlight figure speaks in “countless others.” Overall, voice is distinct, rhythm controlled, and elision taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative layering is dense in every sentence (“serpentine nexus,” “fires of desire,” “liquid starlight”) without pattern-teaching or restraint; triggers −0.4. Mixed metaphors—“weave” vs. “fires” vs. “song”—co-exist without clash resolution. Strong info density when action present, but several near-paraphrase loops (“echoed, transformed,” “altered, transformed”). Closure line avoids muddle, saving mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Premise—cosmic nexus where souls resonate—blends New-Age mysticism with Orphic descent, but execution leans on familiar starlight/echo tropes. Specificity lies in Elara’s vocation (“canyon echo singer”), yet canyon never appears, muting freshness. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. Transformation test: swap “echo” for “ripple” and story holds, indicating moderate genericity.</comment>
