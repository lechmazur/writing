<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is palpable in embodied detail (ticking watch, sand-sunk hand), but the interior contradiction never sharpens into an on-page choice that costs him something we can see; the “decision” to stop lying is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the watch hand swallowed by sand reweights his earlier theft and signals renunciation with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood carving thickens the pattern of erasure—yet the single-scene orientation is late (~140 words) and the causality between “sifting wood” and “I will lie no more” remains metaphorical rather than tactical, keeping the change evocative but not fully inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tiles, salt-rot hush, and splintered clock-driftwood are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s guilt; the terrace’s mirror-fracture and the shore’s carved wood literally guide his attention and final gesture, satisfying the 9+ constraint that setting constrain choice, though spatial anchors (distance, tide line) could be tracked more cleanly across the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep burying truth—tightens once when the watch hand is reclaimed by the sand; pressure is textural, not causal, so the escalation reads as accumulating symbolic weight rather than narrowing options, satisfying the lens but leaving the cost more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited erasure emerges organically from the watch, driftwood “lineage,” and the genealogist’s forged trees; the final image of the shore reclaiming the hand offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer, though the metaphoric equivalence of “sea carvings = truth” is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—cobalt glare, sieved hush, metal bite; rhythmic compression (“He clenched it tighter…”) mirrors rising nausea without head-hopping; diction remains within his dusky, guilt-tinged lexicon, and no dialogue is required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional lyrical layering (“sieved hush that muffled even the crash”) is purposeful, but three near-adjacent “as if” similes in the driftwood paragraph soften momentum; no loops or scaffold obscure causality, and the final sinking hand lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The black-market genealogist who forges bloodlines is fresh, and the watch hand as erased inheritance gives a tactile twist to “timepiece”; the driftwood-as-archive idea risks symbolism-for-symbolism’s-sake but is saved by the sand’s reclamation, yielding a memorable, risk-taking image that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
