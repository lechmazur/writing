<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “quietly proactive” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (tending, rearranging, documenting) that externalize her need to graft meaning onto old wounds; the amber pendant functions as both shield and tether, its warmth grounding her contradictory impulses on the page. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final shared silence with Kai reads as Earned Stasis: vulnerability is no longer solitary but co-witnessed, foreclosing isolation at visible emotional cost. Secondary pressure from Kai is gentle yet present; his notebook reprises her icicle obsession, proving mutual witnessing without collapsing into rescue fantasy. Voice distinction is minimal—both speak in same softened register—but internal hierarchy of values is legible: beauty > safety > exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden shifts from private refuge to shared “honeyed hush,” reweighting vulnerability from liability to bridge. Causality is accumulative/textural: each moss stroke and icicle tracing thickens the texture of healing until Kai’s notebook catalyzes a crystallized poise rather than a plot twist. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in the final amber-lit silence—she has let another body inside the perimeter she built to survive viral exposure, a social risk made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned server racks and mineral veils are filtered through Elara’s pattern-seeking gaze; environment literally supplies the parchment on which she drafts new meaning. Micro-setting—the amber pendant—constrains her stance at the entrance beat and charges the final image when its glow merges with sunset. Spatial choreography is clean: Kai keeps respectful distance, notebook offered not thrust. Sensory economy favors touch and filtered light over panoramic catalog, keeping momentum alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can protected vulnerability survive exposure to a second pair of eyes? Pressure tightens once—Kai’s arrival—forcing a binary: retreat or share the garden. Escalation is situational: no external antagonist, but the stakes feel credible because viral shame lingers as ambient threat. Renunciation of total privacy is visible cost; the garden’s meaning is repriced from solitary sanctuary to shared language.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern recurrence (icicle veils, moss embroidery) rather than statement: healing is a slow accretion of attentive acts, not a redemption arc. Subtext operates in gesture—notebook handed without eye contact, both characters staring at ferns—implying that witness, not confession, is the true graft. Final image reframes “honeyed hush” from solitary balm to mutual pledge, resisting moralizing. Complexity preserved: garden will keep growing, shame still lingers, but shared silence now carries different weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is color-attuned (“emerald,” “amber,” “dappled”) and texture-obsessed, matching her need to embroider decay into beauty. Rhythm escalates toward shorter clauses when Kai appears, then exhales into longer, hushed cadences at close. No head-hopping; Kai’s interiority is inferred only through externals. Free indirect style is clean: “the honeyed hush was no longer just a feeling—it was a shared language” reads as her thought, not authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “moss clung…like nature reclaiming its throne” delivers metaphor without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image that recharges pendant and garden motifs. Occasional adjective pairs (“soft and emerald,” “raw, vulnerable”) are purposeful, not modifiers in lieu of stronger nouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-digital ruin as living embroidery hoop. Premise avoids obvious eco-pastoral by keeping technology present as ghost architecture. Risk taken in quiet, near-plotless structure pays off via accumulative texture rather than twist. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ because viral-shame frame is familiar, but specificity of icicle-pattern documentation lifts it above generic healing-in-ruins tale.</comment>
