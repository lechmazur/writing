<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is sketched with appealing cinematic tags (rogue scholar, cloak, dagger) but remains a bundle of traits rather than a psyche: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only asserted (“his heart quickened,” “chaos converging in his chest”). The moment he could reveal hierarchy-of-values—deciphering under threat—gets narrated in convenient competence instead of visible wavering or cost. Interiority resorts to stock movie language (“charm kicking in”) rather than linguist-specific perception. No interior conflict is staged in the present beat; everything is stated, then ratified by Dr. Krane’s instant approval, so the promised rogue vulnerability never complicates the tactic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is present—Elias leaves with seed + new intel, Lexicon now actively fighting back—so one Decisive Change qualifies. Causality is episodic: panel test → seed reveal → meet-up, each step permitted by off-stage planners rather than protagonist initiative. Seed-decoding carries no visible failure risk or resource cost, so tension is prospective, not on-page. Orientation is clean within 120 words and world-rules are self-consistent; thus modest but functional plot integrity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse is densely sensed (hum of trapped insects, jasmine on coat, fogging panes) and supplies spatial hooks for stealth. Details are filtered through Elias’s goal—scanning for codes—so description stays in motion. Condensation on glass later mirrors tactical uncertainty, a subtle atmospheric echo. Setting never constrains choice (e.g., alarmed greenhouse door, territorial beetles) so it remains illustrative rather than instrumental, capping short of 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lexicon infiltration—arrives late via Krane’s declaration, not through on-screen pursuit of a concrete test. Escalation is prospective (“tonight we fight”) without on-page narrowing of options or forfeiture. Agency is limited to accepting an invitation; decoding the seed presents no risk, cost or alternative path foreclosed. The beat qualifies as one informational tightening but lacks visible price, so pressure stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of subversive language vs. monetized thought emerges organically through seed-cipher and whispered codes rather than editorial statement. Final image of “whisper of rebellion” reweights the greenhouse quiet into anticipatory resistance, offering modest resonance. Complexity is slight—no counter-argument about thought taxation’s appeal or Lexicon’s own exclusionary power—so insight sticks to familiar libertarian binary. Still, message remains implicit, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is consistent, third-person limited to Elias with perceptual tics of stealth (listening for drone of wings, noting scripts). Syntax is fluid, rhythms varied; no filter-verb overload. Dialogue is minimal but quip feels scripted (“not as stealthy as you think / neither are your traps”), lacking idiolectal difference between rogue scholar and scientist. Overall texture competent yet generic—no signature diction or syntactic fingerprint that would mark Elias’s linguist mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, mostly free of loops or scaffolding. Occasional inflation: “encroaching dusk…encroaching darkness” is near-repetition; “chaos converging in his chest” is abstract where physiology would bite. Metaphors stay coherent, no register drift. Information density good—single sentences often perform double duty—so momentum carries reader smoothly to exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise marries dystopian thought-tax to guerrilla gardening cryptography—fresh enough to lift story above routine resistance template. Tropes (rogue academic, secret society, femme-entomologist) are recombined with horticultural steganography, giving specificity. Risk level moderate: plot still marches expected thriller beats (infiltrate → meet insider → rally troops). Freshness lies in micro-details (beetle-fronted resistance) rather than structural innovation, securing a solid but not startling originality score.</comment>
