<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “quiet life” and Lira’s faith in his nose are asserted, not embodied; the only micro-choice—turning the phonograph crank—reads as plot lever rather than character test. Interiority stays generic (“curiosity, long dormant, stirred”) and the closing smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse or flaw is dramatized. The leaf’s transformation supplies external wonder but no internal cost, so the arc lands as mild uplift rather than earned stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: leaf → factory → phonograph → perceptual shift, each beat because-of-the-last. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—distance collapses into closeness—yet the cost is only asserted (“we’re not as far apart as we think”) rather than felt; no concrete option is foreclosed. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. Lens holds, but the final image lacks a persistent constraint or price that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Scrapyard textures—“rusted sheets of steel and shattered glass,” “metallic tang of corrosion”—are selective and filtered through Elias’s nose. The factory interior narrows to the workbench, phonograph, and shifting symbols, guiding the final perceptual flip. Micro-setting (the leaf) charges closure by re-veining light. While environment never actively blocks or wounds the protagonist, it constrains attention and thus meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the wasteland still speak?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: wax leaf warms, symbols glow, amber darkens. The tightening is purely perceptual; no concrete resource, relationship, or safety is risked, so cost remains abstract. Agency resides in a single crank-turn; luck delivers the cylinder and the revelation, limiting escalation bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—ruins as medium of connection—emerges through the phonograph’s voice and the re-veined leaf, avoiding explicit sermon. Subtext is thin; Lira’s soot-smudged face and Elias’s smile carry little unspoken tension. The reweighting is conceptual rather than emotional, so resonance is moderate. No tidy moral is stated, but the insight feels gently prefabricated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is olfactory and weathered (“nose once sharp,” “voice rough from disuse”). Syntax is controlled, with purposeful compression in “sun bled into the horizon.” No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction remains consistent. The final uplift edges toward lyric uplift but stays within the established cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and vivid; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates from long descriptive lines to short declaratives at the reveal. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or action. One near-filter verb (“he realized”) is acceptable; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Post-war scrapyard phonograph is fresh, yet the riddle-to-revelation arc is familiar; specificity comes from scent-based POV and wax-vein map. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist. The synthesis feels inevitable but not startling; transformation is more perceptual than moral or structural.</comment>
