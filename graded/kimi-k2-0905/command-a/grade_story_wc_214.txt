<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s quiet pride and spiritual curiosity are asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The lantern-triggered shift from cleaner to cosmic initiate is declared (“she understood”) rather than forced through a costly micro-choice. The final “earned stasis” is credible but thin because the prior interior struggle is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: lantern dimmed, Lira grounded, cost legible in her changed stance. Causal chain is soft—lantern activates station, she follows coordinates, insight arrives without resistance or trade-off—so escalation feels accumulative/textural rather than driven. Orientation is swift; no lens contradiction at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Station and void are sketched with selective, sensory strokes; lantern as micro-setting constrains her hand and final image. “Skeletal frame etched against the infinite void” gives primal elegance without clutter. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single corridor-to-deck move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she answer the lantern’s call?—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: no active obstacle, resource lost, or option foreclosed. The middle beats repeat wonder rather than tighten; cost is aesthetic, not tactical. Needed one concrete renunciation (sleep, duty, fear) to escalate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges via star-sacrifice imagery and her final calm, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext stays in image (dimmed lantern on shelf) rather than sermon. Complexity is modest—no counter-readings offered—yet resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical, stable distance; diction (“primal elegance,” “cosmic janitor”) maintains poetic register without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long breath to short pulse as she grips lantern. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrase (“eternal canvas”) skirts register edge but stays in POV’s awe. High density achieved through verb choice (“etched,” “plummeted,” “rooted”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-janitor + lantern-as-key is fresh, yet plot arc follows familiar mystic-call template. Risk lies in lyric stillness rather than structural twist; specificity of star-tracking tech and stained uniform lifts it above generic space-mysticism. Not transformative, but memorably voiced.</comment>
