<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to grasp the weight of names—remains an abstract wish until the furnace vision forces her to wear that weight; the embodied chill of the iron mouth and the coin’s burn give us one micro-choice that actually costs. Interiority drifts into paraphrased aphorism (“balance between seen and unseen”) and the visions are served as curated summaries, not lived contradiction. Because the decisive turn is told rather than enacted, we feel her acceptance but not the sweaty, throat-tight moment of it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (rain → foundry → coin → furnace) and holds it to a Charged Poise close, so closure is formally valid. Yet the decisive reconfiguration—coin’s face locking to her sign—lands in a single sentence with no prior foreshadowing of that mechanic, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral; the pattern builds atmosphere but doesn’t tighten options. Because the visions are delivered as bundled parables, causality slips into montage, weakening the required “because” linkage to the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Foundry is sketched with wet iron, cold mouth, moonlit glaze—selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s alchemical eye. Weather stays active: rain stops only after she steps out, cueing internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean—coin warms, furnace breathes, floor steadies underfoot—no floating props. Senses skew visual/thermal; a sniff of scorched oil or ringing anvil could have raised this to 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: will Elara brave the furnace to redeem the coin’s fractured intentions? The middle “step inside” beat supplies the single tightening required for short form, trading safety for knowledge. Cost is present—flames surround her—but because the visions preach rather than endanger, the price stays conceptual; we glimpse no chance of real injury or irrevocable loss. Still, agency is hers and no coincidence rescues her, satisfying baseline escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi-as-philosophy emerges organically: the cracked flask on the bench prefigures the later insight that fractures should be gilded, not erased. Theme—names are earned scars—gains texture through the coin’s glowing seams but is mildly undercut by the tidy final smile that resolves regret too cleanly. Subtext is richest in the mirrored image of rain-washed iron and star-lit sky, letting repaired metal echo repaired self. Ending avoids explicit moral, but “story still being written” nudges toward sentiment; resonance built, not blown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at moderate distance, its diction calmly metallic (“damp metal and herbs,” “cold iron mouth”) consistent with an alchemist’s temperament. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens at the furnace—effective modulation. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied. No dialogue, so no voice-drift risk; internal voice holds. Occasional loftiness (“luminous regret,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly lifts register above Elara’s grounded vocation, keeping this just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly propulsive; scaffolding minimal. Strong nouns/verbs outweigh modifiers, though “luminous regret” and “weight of names” flirt with abstraction. One paraphrase loop inside vision paragraph (“of choices, of names, of lives”) but it mirrors oral litany, so lenient. Mixed-metaphor risk in “thread waiting to be pulled” beside “fractured and in need of redemption” only grazes clarity. Closure line breathes cleanly; no artifact touches it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Alchemist+foundry+zodiac coin could slide into YA-template, yet the kintsugi angle on identity redeems the trope with a non-obvious moral calculus: scars as names. Sensory specificities (gold lacquer on cracked flask, iron mouth’s cold breath) keep the mix fresh. Risk level is moderate—vision-quest in industrial relic—executed competently rather than radically. Concept feels personal, not prompt-stitched, but hasn’t pushed into unforgettable territory.</comment>
