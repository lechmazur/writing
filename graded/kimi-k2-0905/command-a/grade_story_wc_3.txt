<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliara’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile seed-planting and steady scholarship, but interiority drifts into generic “haunted ambitions” labels; the mentor-spirit absence is told, not embodied, so the void never complicates her micro-choices on stage. The final peace is asserted rather than tested by a visible renunciation or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ripe fruit re-weights transition from theory to lived truth, with a faint felt cost (“work was far from over”). Causal chain is thin—seed glows because she plants it, visions arrive without prior setup—so the beat feels magical rather than earned. Orientation is swift and clean; only one causal ellipsis keeps it from the 7-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Magnetic arbor is sketched with selective sensory strokes—shimmering air, humming field—that integrate into action (seed pulses in sync). The floating sanctuary never constrains a tactical choice, but the micro-setting of the study desk and pot anchors the crucial plant/vision beat. Enough specificity for 7+; lacks a final image where environment charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understand transition—signalled early; pressure escalates only once when seed sprouts and visions flood in. No narrowing of options or trade-off is dramatized; the tree simply gives the answer. Cost is conceptual (“work continues”) but not viscerally felt, keeping escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge-as-growth emerges organically from seed-to-fruit arc without moralizing. Final image of “peace” is quiet but tidy; ambiguity is limited, no counter-readings complicate the insight. Resonance is pleasant, not haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Eliara; perceptual signature leans scholarly (“cuneiform scripts,” “analogical thinking”) and rhythmic control is steady. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose is clean, occasionally formal but consistent. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length, no scaffold loops; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” type phrasing) fits academic POV. One mixed metaphor—“knowledge flowing like a river” within vision flood—barely blurs clarity. High density maintained; minor poetic overlay in calm beats does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Floating arbor + knowledge-fruit is fresh color on the “scholar seeks lost truth” template; transformation comes via living metaphor rather than dusty tablet. Risk level moderate—no structural experiment—but specificity of seed-glyphs and magnetic soil keeps it from generic fantasy. Could swap mentor-spirit for any lost-parent trope, trimming originality.</comment>
