<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sensory and embodied (“hands trembling slightly,” “surge of connection”), but the contradiction engine never fully ignites; she catalogues buttons and listens to voices without a moment where two equally live options tear her. The final “quiet inspiration” is asserted rather than dramatized via micro-choice, so the renunciation cost is felt only faintly. Still, her occupation-specific attention to preserved moments gives her a distinct perceptual signature that lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of buttons → echo swell → prophecy re-weighting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar falls silent and Elara pockets the bone button, a visible token that the canyon’s rule-set has shifted from fatalistic echo to portable possibility. Cost is legible in the final image—the once-reverberant jar is now inert, its power spent. The orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath the cliffs is more than postcard: its shelving geometry dictates the button-sorting choreography, and the sunlight filtering through dust becomes the echo’s first visible medium. The bone button’s tactile specificity (carved symbols matching jar markings) constrains the final unlock choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves from shelf to bench to threshold without drift. Sensory selection skews visual, but the haptic click of button against glass compensates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes—“unscramble the canyon echo into usable prophecy”—are declared early and tighten once: when the bone button is pressed to glass, the option to walk away is foreclosed. The cost (jar’s silence = echo spent) is legible but not viscerally felt; we are told Elara feels “charged,” not shown a forfeiture that alters her next move. Under Accumulative lens the density increase is sufficient, yet the absence of a live trade-off keeps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframed metaphor of prophecy-as-raw-material, avoiding final-paragraph sermon. The buttons’ shift from detritus to archival mosaic reweights the meaning of “lost time” without explicit statement. Subtext resides in the silence that follows the chorus: wisdom is portable only when the original vessel empties itself. The ending image—wind whispering through an now-echoless canyon—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays consistently anchored in Elara’s perceptual filter: “sunlight filtering through the dust” is what she notices, not omniscient scene-setting. Syntax lengthens under calm sorting, then compresses at the climax (“glass trembled, echo swelling”), mirroring pressure. No dialogue appears, so no voice contamination. The occasional elevated diction (“deliberate grace,” “crystallized final moment”) nudges register slightly above occupational vernacular but remains internally coherent.</comment>

<comment>Prose is largely clean: no filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold-ish loop—“the echo was not just a sound but a fragment...a truth waiting”—is forgiven because it teaches the accreting pattern. Information density is high; single sentences often fuse sensory, symbolic, and motive work (“She arranged them in rows, their shapes and colors forming a mosaic of forgotten lives”). Ear-test rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The hourglass-turner who unscrambles canyon echoes via lost buttons is a fresh synthesis of memory-archivist and prophecy-smith tropes. Transformation test passes: swap names and the button-to-bone-button unlock mechanics still feel particular to this world. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure rather than reversals—but coherence stays high. No close echoes of famous lines; the final wind-whisper re-images a familiar canyon trope without plagiarizing it.</comment>
