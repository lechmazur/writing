<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s interior contradiction—clinging to a lost joy while craving release—is embodied in the crumpled program and the gauntlet drop; the micro-choice to unsnap carries visible cost. The arc from “withdrawn knight” to “storyteller” is signaled early, but the final label “storyteller” is declared rather than demonstrated through a fresh action, blunting the sense of genuine renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the program dissolves into the orchard, Alaric stands taller, and possibility itself is repriced. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density peaks as vine-light and ink fuse; causality is maintained within this lyric logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: bioluminescent vines teach the marionette patterns, constrain Alaric’s reading of reality, and supply the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—gravel crunch, gauntlet clang, ink seepage—each tactile beat maps onto the next without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</degree><comment>Dominant stake—“to capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens once: the vine patterns force Alaric to literalize the allegiance. The unsnapping beat forecloses the path of passive nostalgia, but the cost (armor shed) feels symbolic rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the re-pricing of story itself: puppets without strings equal agency inside endless night. Subtext stays in image—ink under skin, gauntlet hollow-clang—avoiding overt thesis until the final “storyteller” label, which slightly over-articulates the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Alaric’s perceptual filter: armor scars, nightshade scent, paper warmth. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentence during vine storm, then clipped declarative at recognition—without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: a single sentence often layers sensory cue, memory shard, and symbolic charge (“ink seeping into his skin like a tattoo”). Only minor loop: “patterns…patterns…” in adjacent clauses; does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar trope—haunted knight in magical greenhouse—feels fresh via alchemical botany plus marionette semiotics. The fusion of puppetry with plant-light as instruction code is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that reweights the premise.</comment>
