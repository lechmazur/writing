<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” bent is shown through her gentle tending of unlikely plants, but her interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“beauty could thrive even in the most unlikely places”) rather than moment-specific contradiction. The lockmaster arrives as gentle mirror, not pressure source, so her final gesture of surrendering the tooth costs her nothing we can feel; the stance never tightens. Dialogue converges to the same soft register, flattening voice distinction. Still, her tactile gardening micro-moves and pocketed tooth give enough embodied specificity to stay above mid-line.</comment>

<comment>The piece lands a lightweight Charged Poise: the two retain their separate lives but now share a “quivering hush,” a felt reconfiguration rather than a causal change. Cost is only implied—they might meet again—so the closure skirts the visible price required for 9-band entry. Orientation is swift and lens holds accumulative/lyric pattern, but escalation is static; beat structure is observe-observe-observe, observe-observe-resolve, which keeps the tightening gentle rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Moonlit harbor, fire-escape ledge, and the “old rosebush” are sketched with cinematic economy; selective lantern gleams on water mirror internal flickers without over-signalling. Spatial choreography is clean—third-floor descent to pier reads effortlessly. The lockmaster’s tooth and the lantern handle serve as micro-setting objects that finally interlock, earning the 9-quick test. Dock geography stays stable; weather merely decorates rather than constrains, capping just below top tier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elara connect or stay solitary?—is declared early but pressure stays atmospheric, never tightening her options. No concrete loss (time, social risk, plant jeopardy) is hazarded; the rose petal and bitting gauge work as mood cues, not irreversible triggers. The lockmaster’s arrival complicates nothing; their convergence feels pre-ordained, so agency never escalates. One gentle micro-turn—handing over the tooth—changes symbolism, not tactics, yielding only a hush rather than a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “reflecting light into dark corners” is never sermonized; it surfaces through recurrent lantern/moon/tending imagery and culminates in the mirrored tooth-lantern recognition. Subtext is modest but intact—she gifts away the very fragment that first promised private illumination, suggesting connection as its own repricing. The harbor hush lingers as ethical ambiguity: is solitude surrendered or merely shared? The piece avoids tidy moral accounting, letting image do the final work. Still, the conceptual cost is soft, keeping it shy of top resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice sustains a consistent lyric third-person close, weighted toward poetic catalog (“luminous harbor,” “mirror,” “quivering hush”) that suits Elara’s wistful lens. Syntax varies, lines breathe, and no filter-verb clusters gum the immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but tonally aligned; no head-hop or register drift. The slight surplus of abstract qualifiers (“peculiar stillness,” “protected vulnerability”) prevents full texture punch but keeps the read aloud smooth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with only one soft paraphrase pair (“the world held its breath / world seemed to stand still”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple inflation. High information density: each sentence layers light, plant, tooth, or oar detail without stall. Final third is artifact-free, allowing the quiet closure to resonate. Near 9-band but occasional adjective drift (“soft glow,” “gentle breeze”) keeps it just sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combination of moonlit dock gardening and locksmith bitting gauge is fresh, welding horticultural tenderness to clandestine metal precision. The “quivering hush” motif imports cinematic stillness but risks familiar poetic tropes; rose petal countdown nods to Beauty and the Beast without subverting it. Risk level is moderate—lyric quietude over plot—but execution coherent. Specificity of lantern-handle matching tooth saves the concept from pure atmospherics, earning a modest originality bump.</comment>
