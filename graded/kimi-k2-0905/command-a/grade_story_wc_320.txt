<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction—“a strange sense of peace,” “she understood”—without embodied contradiction. The only micro-choice we watch is dial-twisting that re-ignites the shard; the prior false assumption about finite power is told, not dramatized through visible cost or risk. No second character means status crucible is off the table; the arc lands as a tidy epiphany rather than a renunciation with palpable forfeiture. Voice is consistent, but emotional layering thins under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the city revives and silence is redefined, carrying conceptual cost (“promise of the future”). Orientation is secure by line 5; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of refrains (“silence,” “beginning in every ending”) intensifies until cadence flips. The causal spine is thin—twist dial → glow brightens—but causality is not required under this lens. Cost is felt, but the constraint (what Elara can never do again) is not foreclosed on the page, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The gorge-borne city is sketched in three cinematic strokes—crumbling towers, moonlit gorge, leaning shadows—then threaded through action: towers hum, shadows shift, gorge shimmers under shard-light. Micro-setting rules: the tower’s rusted frame dictates where Elara can stand and offers conductive metal for the shard’s discharge. Sensory hierarchy favors sight over other senses, but selection is POV-appropriate for a sky-high technician. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is conceptual: prove silence is fertile, not void. One tightening occurs when the shard dims—Elara realizes the “finite tool” misbelief—yet the reversal is narrated summary, not a choice that costs her an option. Agency is interpretive (tuning) rather than risk-bearing; no resource is spent, deadline missed, or path foreclosed. Pressure is lyric, not tactical; under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies and flips meaning, satisfying minimal escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as generative space—emerges through repeating imagery and the final redefinition rather than moralizing. The shard’s evolution from tool to mirror reweights the premise, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext is modest; abstract phrasing (“song of beginnings”) edges toward pseudo-profundity but stays anchored to the concrete tuning act. Resonance lingers, yet complexity is thin because no competing value is tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent atmospheric cadence; diction tilts poetic but stays within Elara’s technical sensibility (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”). Rhythm modulates—long vowel echoes mimic radio static, tightening during tuning beats. No dialogue to test; perceptual signature is coherent if not idiosyncratic. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy dominates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are dense—almost every sentence carries a figurative vehicle—but the pattern is taught early (“skeletal fingers”) and culminates in the charged reprise, so density penalty is waived. Occasional soft scaffolding: “She smiled faintly, her heart steady” adds no new pressure. Line clarity is high, no contradictory imagery or tense drift. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “silence” motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>“Radio-city suspended over gorge” plus “lunar-perigee-powered relic” yields a fresh visual synthesis; concept risks steampunk-gothic cliché but avoids brass goggles. The silence-as-void inversion is familiar, yet tuning via discarding assumptions gives the arc a slight methodological twist. Emotional specifics stay generic—no personal memory or social stake particularizes Elara. Sufficiently memorable, not radically new.</comment>
