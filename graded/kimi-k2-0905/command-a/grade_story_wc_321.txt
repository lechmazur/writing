<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s “resiliently positive” trait is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory action; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible emotional price, so the interiority stays flat. The moment she hands the hourglass to the transient should crystallize a value hierarchy, yet it reads as courteous plot setup rather than sacrifice. Because no flaw or internal conflict complicates her choice to enter the rift, the earned-change test fails and the closure feels predetermined.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is clean—hourglass map → rift dive → ferry reset—but the midpoint escalation is delivered in explanatory summary (“she felt herself stretched thin”) rather than dramatized beats, softening the cost signal. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: glowing sand confirms timeline merge, and Mara’s collapse supplies visible cost. However, the rift rules are invented on entry and the hourglass mechanics appear only at climax, so the payoff is resonant but not fully earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<comment>“Spectral grotto under starlight” is atmospherically vivid and the shifting wall glyphs provide tactile interaction, letting setting guide Mara’s decoding action. Spatial anchoring drifts once inside the rift—kaleidoscope imagery is generic and ungrounded in bodily position, creating momentary white-room. The hourglass functions as micro-setting and its final charged state re-weights the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the ferry—remains clear; pressure tightens when the transient warns “the timelines will destroy you,” foreclosing the safe option. Yet the actual complication is narrated rather than tested: we are told she is “stretched thin” but see no beat-level tactical sacrifice or reversible loss. The final reset carries conceptual cost, but escalation lacks an on-page fork where Mara must abandon an alternate benefit, keeping the conflict emotionally mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of endurance-through-optimism emerges via recurrence, but the story articulates it overtly (“her resiliently positive spirit unbroken”) in the final paragraph, blunting subtext. Because Mara’s stance never meets a credible counter-argument or ironic reconfiguration, the insight feels pre-decided. The glowing sand image offers a quiet thematic reprise, yet the conceptual repricing is undercut by the explicit moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction favors soft consonants and starlit imagery that suits the spectral tone. Syntax loosens under pressure—“world dissolved into a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds”—but remains coherent. Distinct perceptual signature is moderate; Mara filters the world through nautical pattern-recognition, but interior cadence doesn’t differentiate markedly from the narrator’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, with purposeful paragraph breaks and no scaffold loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “resiliently positive demeanor”) edges toward academic register not grounded in POV lexicon. Mixed metaphors are absent; rhythm modulates effectively across beats. A single paraphrase loop—“she felt herself stretched thin… she pressed on”—reduces immediacy slightly but does not touch closure.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Time-bent ferry rescue is familiar SF material, yet the empty hourglass from a backwards-flowing timeline provides a fresh causal hinge. The “interconnected patterns” concept stays abstract, limiting transformative depth. Risk level is moderate—lyric compression over dramatized beats—but the hourglass payoff feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the non-obvious synthesis test at the low end of the high band.</comment>
