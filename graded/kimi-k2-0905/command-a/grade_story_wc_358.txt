<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s investigative drive is vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“rapidly adapting mind”) rather than dramatized in a visible micro-choice; the patch moment is strong embodiment, yet final renunciation lacks a fresh beat—cost is felt but not acted upon in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: patch → wind funnel → crashed plane → foresight failure; orientation anchors within 120 w, escalation tightens at the collapsed stack; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing (“silence is echo of failure”) and visible cost on Elara’s stance—lens stays causal to end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Container labyrinth is tactile and constrains movement; salt-metal scent, jagged skyline, and flashlight streaks anchor POV bias; spatial choreography is clean as Elara kneels inside the wreck—final image of moonlit shadows reweights the maze as monument to foresight’s limits.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing future disasters—threads every beat; wind-pattern discovery tightens options, forcing realization that engineering escape was impossible; cost is legible in the crushed plane and Elara’s weighted exit; no second reversal, but single deepening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges tacitly: human systems blind to nature’s chaotic vectors; patch and containers recur with accruing weight, final silence reframes earlier hubbub; avoids moralizing, letting image of moonlit maze carry the repricing—subtext in “echo of failure” lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“hazy precision,” “rusted edges catching glow”) matches tonal brief; rhythm tightens under flashlight sweep; no dialogue hence no voice convergence—perceptual signature remains consistent, legible, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or mixed metaphors; occasional elevated fragments (“guts of a giant”) are patterned early and payoff in wreck description; final paragraph drifts toward abstract nouns (“fragility,” “foresight”) slowing cadence—minor artifact keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Convergence of storm, containers, and emergency landing feels non-obvious; investigator POV reverses usual disaster template by foregrounding predictive failure; risk is moderate—lyric container maze freshens port-set crash tale, though core twist (wind tunnel) is discernible early.</comment>
