<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative (“shadow-laced,” “pulse of the world”) but stays performative; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The mirrors expose fears, yet agency is reactive—she watches, then places the fragment. A credible renunciation lands, but the cost is asserted (“shift within her”), not embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s radiance reweights empathy-to-action as social cost. Causal chain is thin—fragments magnetize without prior rule—but the lens (Hybrid→Accumulative) holds. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Lighthouse orchard” and “ice floes” are compressed into one glance yet recur to constrain the final beacon-image. Salt-apple scent, creaking boards, and opaque mirror glass give tactile triangulation. Setting is the chargable object that powers the climax; meets 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend fractured souls—loosed early. Pressure escalates only interpretively: each mirror is a micro-turn, yet no option is foreclosed until the final chime. Cost is conceptual (empathy mapped to light), not tactile; hence mid-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as environmental empathy without sermon. Mirrors reprice “courage as understanding,” culminating in lighthouse beacon—an earned conceptual flip. Subtext stays in images (battlefield mediator) rather than exposition; avoids moralizing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is atmospheric, not idiolectic. Prose textures (“air thick with aged wood and dust”) modulate cadence without drumbeat. No dialogue to test separation; internal voice avoids filter-verb drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are lean, with high noun specificity; no synonym loops. Two stock strings—“shifting ice floes,” “pulse of the world”—slip into template cadence. Figurative muddle absent; closure image remains luminous and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>“Empathy-through-mirrors” is fresh inflection; orchard-lighthouse merges biomes inventively. Premise edges close to crystal-relic trope, but vintage-mirror mechanic rescues it. Not risky enough for bonus, yet specifics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
