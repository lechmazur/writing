<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s underestimated-rebel trait is set up early and pays off in her risky archive heist, but interiority stays generic (“her heart pounding,” “her mind raced”) and the moment she decodes the ledger is summarized, not embodied. The key-as-defiance symbol is strong, yet her competence feels slightly too smooth—no visible misstep that would dramatize the “underestimated” label under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: puddle-map → lagoon dive → key-in-door → broadcast → escape, tightening options each beat. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the citywide data-dump reweights the rule-set with undeniable social cost—satisfying Q2’s cost test. Orientation is clean by 80 words; only minor elasticity is the off-stage enforcers whose arrival is heard, not seen, a permissible compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lagoon surface, submerged door, and archival dust are selectively textured; starlight-on-water returns in the final image, reweighting the stakes. The micro-setting of the brass key in Mara’s wet palm constrains her grip and signals defiance under pressure. No sensory checklist; each detail is filtered through Mara’s goal-directed attention, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“hold the line against tyranny of indifference”—is signaled early and escalates when the ledger broadcast forecloses retreat: Mara becomes hunted transmitter, not mere thief. Cost is visible: she forfeits safety and must vanish into shadows. Pressure tightens once, cleanly under causal lens; enforcers’ off-stage proximity suffices as complicating beat rather than resolving coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of coded freedom emerges through the key, ledger, and starlit broadcast rather than overt statement. Final image—Mara as “ghost in their machine”—reconfigures the premise indivisibly from her choices. No late moralizing; only a half-line of near-tell (“tyranny of indifference would not stand”) is forgivable hiccup amid otherwise implicit resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara with consistent perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax modulates—“the lagoon seemed to resist her” mirrors her emotional drag without filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a rebel-autodidact range; “auric,” “holographic,” and “propaganda” feel earned by her archive immersion. Voice texture is distinctive enough to lift above mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing”-level abstraction appears only in the broadcast moment, justified by stakes. Information density strong; each sentence layers action, object, and atmosphere without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis is the puddle-reflection map—an ingenious, low-tech decryption method that feels inevitable yet surprising. Key-from-defunct-booth and submerged archive twist familiar rebel tropes into tactile specificity. Some phrasings edge toward genre convention (“ghost in their machine,” “stars seemed to wink”), preventing a higher band, but overall angle is memorable.</comment>
