<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—antique pull as tactile anchor, moon-phase belief as worldview—but her “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is declared more than dramatized in micro-choice. General Kael’s stern loyalty is sketched by silhouette, not contradiction; his single nod feels concessionary rather than costly. The earned stasis lands, but only Elara pays visible price. Still, both actors stay consistent and the relationship crucible does shift status.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the drawer pull’s passage crystallizes a new joint stance under the waning moon, cost felt in Kael’s “I do not forgive lightly.” Causal lens holds: Elara’s recycled-mistake rhetoric directly enables Kael’s consent. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One scaffold paraphrase (“tonight is not about victory or defeat… it’s about untethering”) is allowed at this band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Parapet, mist, storm, lantern, and brass pull create a tight micro-setting that constrains movement and staging; the wind literally forces them to lean in, shaping dialogue rhythm. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over vista, matching negotiation focus. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the object does, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking the apology-forgiveness currency—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s refusal forecloses easy absolution. Escalation is situational: storm and pride apply coherent pressure; Elara’s rhetoric is the single agency that reweights options. Cost is legible in Kael’s grudging nod and Elara’s smile that knows the path is fragile. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: cycles of blame can be recycled into tentative coexistence if both sides agree to stand in neutral shadow. The drawer pull’s history and the moon’s waning phase reweight the idea without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s silence and the lantern’s flicker carries the apology he cannot voice. Final image avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in the mist-veiled parapet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature filters every detail through negotiation bias—moon as calendar, brass as wisdom talisman. Syntax is elevated but consistent with her ceremonial mindset; no register drift. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual: Kael’s “neutrality is a luxury” carries entire geopolitics. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with storm gusts; sentences shorten when lantern flickers. Metaphors (“mist clung…like forgotten secrets”) are singular, not stacked. One paraphrase loop noted above; no synonym churn. Information density is high—each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Copy is clean; only the occasional adjective “storm-worn windblown” feels slightly purple but fits voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Moon-phase diplomacy and drawer-pull historiography give fresh angle on familiar peace-parley trope. Situational pressure rather than secret twist drives originality. Specificity of parapet negotiation ritual feels bespoke. Risk is moderate—lyric escalation could have deflated into cliché but holds. Still, premise is recognizable; transformation is more interior than world-rule.</comment>
