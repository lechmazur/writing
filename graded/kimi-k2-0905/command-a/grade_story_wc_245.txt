<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—blind yet mapping—stays vivid in embodied beats like “fingers danced over parchment.” The final renunciation (compass needle still, she carries the stillpoint within) is earned and forecloses external quest. No secondary character means relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices (kneeling, letting silence wash) reveal value hierarchy. Cost is felt: her maps shift from land to heart, a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass stills, reweighting “north” as internal. Accumulative lens holds—density of absorbed languages crystallizes into one note. Cost is legible: “the melody remained, etched into her soul.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum compass function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the hum guides her steps, the ring’s steadying signals the stillpoint. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile & auditory, appropriate to blindness. Spatial choreography clean: trail of notes → clearing → pool. Final image reuses compass in charged reprise, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map her own heart—signaled early. Pressure tightens when melody insists; option to retreat is foreclosed by “quiet blaze of determination.” Accumulative escalation: each absorbed language raises emotional density until distilled into single note. Cost visible: she forfeits external cartography for internal, a trade-off legible in last paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: cartography of emotion beats land. Compass reappears as reweighted symbol of inner north. Final image offers non-literal answer—stillpoint carried within—recharging prior motifs. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—sound & touch prioritized. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for forest hum, fragments at climax (“A single, pure note.”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Diction within plausible blind mapmaker lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: “constellations paused” does world-building and temporal anchoring in four words. Metaphors are consistent (silence as liquid, melody as breadcrumb). One scaffold detected: “quiet blaze of determination” borders cliché but saved by context. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind cartographer + ultrasonic forest + language-absorbing skin feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Stillpoint as internal reservoir reframes fantasy trope. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure. Could swap forest name without breakage, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
