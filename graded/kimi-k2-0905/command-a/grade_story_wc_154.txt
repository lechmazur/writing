<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—condensation traced like tears, wrist numbed from prior deciphering—and her micro-choice to carry the child’s decoded plea into the night crystallizes her value hierarchy. The “shrewdly innocent” trait surfaces once, but never complicates or forecloses a tactical option, so it stays ornamental. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the ache is declared rather than tested under competing pressure. The final determination feels earned because the decoded map materially alters her next step, but the emotional cost is only asserted, not embodied in a visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coral’s steady glow and the imperative “Tell them the ocean still sings” reconfigure her private grief into public voice—cost is felt if not yet paid. Causal chain holds—each deciphered line narrows her moral option space toward action. Orientation is swift: “mist-clad atrium at twilight” anchors who/where/when within 30 words. One shard only, no transition, so default scope met; no amnesia or prop teleport.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory triage is POV-driven—jasmine and damp earth cut through translator’s hyper-attuned nose; generators hum beyond ruined glass—details selected for conflict-zone ear. Micro-setting of the child’s cast and coral fragment function as geography: ridges provide literal cipher surface, glow gives low-light visibility for her task. Spatial choreography is clean—coral on table, cast in hand, doors at her back, step into night—no impossible drift. Environment does not physically constrain, so 9-gate unmet, but atmosphere charges the final threshold image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give voice to the vanished child’s sanctuary—signalled early via “unknot the meaning.” One meaningful tightening: deciphering the final phrase forces her from interpreter to messenger, foreclosing private withdrawal. Cost is conceptual (shared grief now hers to vocalize) but not viscerally dramatized—no loss of safety, tool, or social capital on-page. Pressure escalates through knowledge, not external jeopardy; under Causal lens this suffices, though price could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: memory as salvage, translation as resurrection. Coral and ocean motif tracks from bombed aquarium to final “ocean still sings,” reweighted from relic to living voice—no abstract thesis stated. Subtext is carried in gesture—finger tracing condensation, coral glow syncing with pulse—rather than commentary. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing. Complexity slightly blunted because child’s absence is idealized, not morally contradictory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filters—professional translator notices language smears, war-zone textures, never drifts to child’s POV. Syntax flexes with pressure—long, humid clauses in atrium, clipped imperative at exit—showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests in lyrical but precise diction that avoids purple excess. Filter verbs minimal and justified; metaphor stays within coastal lexicon, sustaining credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “mist-clad atrium” packs scene in two words; each sentence advances either cipher progress or atmospheric charge. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language limited to two sustained metaphors—coral as memory, ocean as voice—that payoff at close. Opening and closing lines carry earmark resonance. Minor micro-scaffold: “a place of safety, a memory...” restates prior information, but does not occlude causality or dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—conflict-zone translator decrypts child’s cast to locate hidden reef—is fresh, avoiding war-zone clichés by centering on language salvage rather than battlefield heroics. Coral fragment as cipher surface offers specific, non-obvious device. Risk of lyrical mode is taken and largely paid off. Echoes of “ocean still sings” could flirt with sentimentality but is grounded in earlier material. Overall, synthesis feels particular, though child-as-martyr figures lightly idealized.</comment>
