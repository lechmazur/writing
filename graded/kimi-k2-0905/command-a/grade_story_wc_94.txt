<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“furiously tranquil gaze”) and the final micro-choice—writing uncensored—pays the cost of shedding anonymity. Yet the contradiction between fleeing censorship and instantly embracing exposure is asserted, not dramatized; no intermediate beat shows the risk of speaking. The map-of-scars motivation is vivid but acts as external prompt rather than emergent flaw that compounds choices. Emotional arc is coherent but leans on epiphanic summary at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timer clicks and storm builds density until the map reweights identity. Closure is a Charged Poise—the first uncensored line—whose cost is felt in the same breath that peace is claimed. Causality is poetic rather than plot-based: envelope arrival is unexplained, but functions as mythic summons accepted by stance, not strategy. Orientation is swift; only the hometown bus schedule’s significance stays abstract, a minor waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory is more than postcard: glass dome refracts lightning onto the protagonist’s shadow, turning architecture into mirror of internal exposure. Darkroom timer and timetable shrink space to tactile objects that constrain pacing—timer governs silence, timetable embodies abandoned routes. Sensory economy favors sound (clicks, thunder) and filtered light, mirroring narrowed perception under pressure. Setting charges the final image: writing begins as dome flashes, fusing place to decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara break lifelong self-censorship?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulative storm and ticking timer; map arrival tightens by forcing confrontation with literal skin-level memories. Agency resides in internal stance shift rather than external obstacle; cost is present but conceptual (loss of protective silence) rather than visceral. Escalation is single-beat yet coherent under lyric lens; would benefit from one intermediate complication testing refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—art born of scar-mapping—emerges via map image and uncensored writing act, never moralized. Subtext operates in envelope’s anonymity and timetable’s obsolete routes, implying escape cycles. Final image reweights earlier “censored poet” label without naming theme. Some abstraction around “cartography of scars” edges toward prompt-echo, but saved by bodily specificity of drawn map.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature favors meteorological and anatomical metaphor (“storm-kissed wonder,” “skin of the world”). Syntax grows more fragmented as tension peaks, mirroring cognitive rarefaction. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Register stays poetic but anchored to observatory tools, avoiding purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm variety and selective metaphor keep momentum; only occasional modifier stacks (“weathered desk, their fingers tracing”) flirt with overwriting. No template cadence or synonym loops. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; closing line couples thunderclap to narrative seal, earning flourish. Minor scaffold: repeated “storm outside seemed to…” construction three times—each serves personification pattern but slightly thins late beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of darkroom timer, bus timetable, and skin-map feels fresh; mundane objects repurposed as existential instruments. “Cartography of scars” concept avoids cliché by anchoring to hand-drawn body map with named wounds. Stormlit observatory above clouds is visually striking yet risks familiar romantic trope; saved by its function as literal glass exposing writer to sky/audience. Timetable-as-relic could drift into nostalgia shorthand, but linkage to obsolete life routes specifies it.</comment>
