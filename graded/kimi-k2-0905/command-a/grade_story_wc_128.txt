<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “shrewd” trait is asserted but never shown in a cargo decision; the locket photo is handled twice but doesn’t force a hard choice. Interiority stays generic (“mind racing,” “felt compelled”) without embodied contradiction. Final meeting is pleasant but no cost or value hierarchy is tested; the friendship simply blooms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is gentle but intact: mis-addressed letter → curiosity → correspondence → meeting. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Elara feels the locket “lighter,” implying cycle completion—but no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. Orientation is clear within 120 words; single transition to library is smooth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Salt-pine breeze and open-roof library are sketched with quick sensory strokes; details are filtered through Elara’s seaside habits. Setting never constrains her choices; the library could be any quiet place. Stars provide mood but do not charge the final image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic (“initiate compassion”) rather than tactical; no external obstacle or internal risk materializes. Pressure plateaus after the envelope is opened; escalation is replaced by epistolary summary. Meeting carries zero jeopardy or trade-off, so the tightening required for 8+ never arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of “compassion as cycle” is stated early and echoed in Clara’s grandmother line, but it remains an asserted thesis. Subtext is absent; every emotional beat is spelled out. Final image of the lighter locket offers a modest reweighting, yet the cost side of the cycle is invisible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Elara with consistent psychic distance. Prose is clean, rhythmically neutral, lacking a distinctive perceptual signature. No dialogue on page; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Voice neither obscures nor elevates the material.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences are clear, concise, and free of loops or scaffold. Occasional soft filler (“mind racing,” “cool night”) but nothing that stalls momentum. Metaphors are restrained and coherent; no artifact touches the closure beat. Efficient, serviceable line work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Premise of “lost letter sparks friendship” is familiar; the cargo-broker angle and seaside micro-setting add light specificity but do not transform the trope. No bold structural or perspectival risk is taken. The execution is competent yet could swap names and places without structural change.</comment>
