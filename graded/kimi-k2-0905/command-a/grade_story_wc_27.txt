<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity and awkward confidence are vividly embodied—she pads through rust and starlight, opera glasses in hand—but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“awkward confidence transform into something steadier”) rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The grandmother backstory is used once for texture, never tested against present choice, so the interior arc feels foregone, not earned. Opera glasses work as charged heirloom, but no micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything with them; the stone circle supplies the decisive jolt, not her own friction. Result: a luminous persona whose final resolve is more announced than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: star-images and hum-density layer toward a Charged Poise ending—the cosmic thread vision reweights her stance with conceptual cost (“she would reignite them, not with weapons…”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no penalty. Causality is lyric, not sequential—pressure accumulates through sensory repetition (skylight slivers, rising hum) rather than because/therefore turns. Closure is valid RR, but the beat of transformation is delivered by the stone circle’s external magic, not a prior constraint she actively tests, so cost feels adjacent rather than personally wrought.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Spaceport repair bay’s rusted hulks, fractured skylights, and half-buried stone circle are tactile, specific, and filter through Lira’s stargazer bias—she notices light angles, star-slit vistas, concrete chill on soles. Opera glasses function as micro-setting proxy: brass tarnish, grandmother aura, literal lens that refracts both vision and meaning. Environment actively constrains the ending: the hum emanates from the embedded circle, forcing her stance shift; the broken roof lets actual stars in, tying macro to micro. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalog, only the creaking bay and pulsing stones needed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is declared early; pressure escalates via sensory accumulation (hum volume, star vibrancy) rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off or visible price is exacted; the stone circle gifts revelation gratis. Agency is receptive (she kneels, peers, accepts cosmic thread) rather than active gambit. Result: a poetic deepening that satisfies the accumulative lens but stays below high-band cost threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: meaning resides in "small acts of courage, quiet moments of connection," not victory speeches. Subtext is carried by the opera glasses—grandmother’s lost art repurposed as lens for collective rebellion—avoiding overt statement. Final image refuses weaponized hope, reweighting the rebellion trope toward tenderness; this conceptual reprice lands cleanly. No moralizing paragraph, only star-whispered implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, diction kept within Lira’s star-minded lexicon—“slivers of daylight,” “shimmering thread woven into the fabric.” Rhythm swells with hum-intensity, sentences lengthen then contract, mirroring thunderous serenity. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Perceptual signature is strong: she sees star-patterns where others see junk, and that bias governs every descriptive choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, loop-free; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (stars as living constellations, hum as sleeping beast). Information density high—each sentence layers setting, object, and emotional charge. Occasional elevated register (“a margin of illumination before dusk fully claimed the sky”) fits the operatic frame, but two abstract intensifiers (“thunderous serenity”) risk sonic overkill yet are pattern-taught early. No artifacts touch closure; final line is imagist and taut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—post-rebellion lull, mystical stone circle, heirloom reveal—are refreshed through sensory inversion: stargazer barefoot on cold concrete, hum as quiet cosmic purr rather than epic roar. Opera glasses repurposed from elite theater to rebel telescope offer specific cultural twist. Risk is moderate; execution is graceful rather than groundbreaking. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not startlingly new.</comment>
