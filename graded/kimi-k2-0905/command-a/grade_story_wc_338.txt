<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” nature are shown through tactile beats (fingering grooves, frame-by-frame video scrubbing) rather than told. Contradictory impulses surface once: scholarly hunger vs. protectively skeptical restraint, but the beat is brief and not revisited under rising pressure. The final descent into the chapel lands as earned renunciation of surface certainty, paid for by days of literal digging; the cost is visible, quiet, and scaled to word count. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; single-POV voice stays coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: misalignment in the stones is discovered because Elara compares footage, therefore she digs, therefore she finds the chapel—each beat tightens options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chapel’s silence reweights the henge from relic to living testament, cost felt in her “heart heavy with reverence.” The price is legible but not irrevocable—scholars will come—so the tightening is meaningful yet not final; this keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault is not backdrop; its scoured layers cue Elara’s tree-ring mindset and justify her micro-excavation tactics. The henge’s misalignment is spatially tracked across two time-stamped video frames, then confirmed by shovel in same coordinates—tight choreography. Fresco glow revival in final line acts as micro-setting mirror of her internal re-enlightenment, charging closure. Environment thus constrains method and final image, meeting 9+ gate, but diction occasionally drifts to tour-guide cadence (“masterpiece of endurance”) which blurs POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the chapel remain silent forever?”—is signaled early and tightens once: discovery of misalignment converts abstract quest into urgent dig. Agency is continuous; every shovel stroke forecloses the option to walk away. Cost accumulates in time, fatigue, and the irreversible exposure of the site to future crowds. Under causal lens the escalation is clean, but the final price is more conceptual than visceral; no tool breaks or physical toll appears on page, capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that silence accrues meaning only when interpreted by an attentive, empathetic listener—no character ever states this; it is shown through Elara’s refusal to leave the quiet vault. The henge-fresco-chapel triad reweights from dead history to living dialogue without moralizing. Final image of revived fresco colors offers conceptual repricing: knowledge literally illuminates the past, but also exposes it to erosion. Subtextual tension between preservation and revelation lingers, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-visual—“rain-scoured,” “grooves,” “frame by frame”—consistent with map-framer’s profession. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for excavation accumulation, clipped fragments for strike moment (“wood, ancient and preserved”). No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on narrative voice; register stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon save for one elevated phrase (“masterpiece of endurance”) that momentarily surfaces. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hop or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphing breathes with discovery beats. High information density: each sentence layers time, tool, or tactile detail. One paraphrase loop detected (“silence she sought to interpret” echoes prior “interpret silence with empathy”)—minor, non-closure touching, −0.2. Metaphors are coherent (vault as tree rings) and do not collide. No scaffold or template cadence in final third; therefore 9+ ban is waived. Closing line lands cleanly without overwritten glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion of map-tearing metaphor with archaeological silence is fresh; no familiar trope dominates. Transformation test passes: swap “map framer” for “acoustic engineer” and the emotional arc collapses—profession-specific attention drives plot. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but coherence remains high. Could use one more idiosyncratic detail (personal ritual, tool quirk) to fully individuate Elara and push into 8.5+ band.</comment>
