<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand on the shell, the heartbeat sync—and her renunciation of safety for orchard-revival carries visible cost. The “gap between knowing and understanding” is lived, not labelled. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 9-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard’s reawakening is legible, the statues’ dust is the price, and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural. Causality is intact—shell → heartbeat → root uprising—though the shell’s rule-set is slightly late-introduced. One fine slip keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The violin, body, and shell function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; the orchard’s tarnished hues return brightened in the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—cool shell against skin, soil tremor underfoot—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible statue positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—orchard’s life vs. mechanical order—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when heartbeat-sync forecloses retreat. Escalation is driven by her agency (shell pressed to chest, bow steady on swaying bridge) with visible cost: statues dissolve, shell light dies. One tightening suffices; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the shell’s reweighting: beauty reawakened through sacrifice, not sermon. The final image of inert shell beside brightened leaves offers resonant non-literal answer. No echo-statements or final-paragraph moralizing; the orchard’s color shift is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—star-wood violin “breathes,” statues “scan,” heartbeat “merges with roots”—and rhythm accelerates under pressure without monotony. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens cleanly to her chest-cavity pulse. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, never clustered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary opening and length, propelling toward the final glowing shell. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and diction never drifts above Elara’s lyrical but grounded lexicon. High information density: each line advances image, beat, or cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The star-wood violin + locust-shell + heartbeat-sync synthesis feels inevitable and fresh; remove any piece and the root-uprising fails. Tarnished-wonder tone and mechanical-statue orchard are not stock templates. Risk—lyric pause mid-uprising—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
