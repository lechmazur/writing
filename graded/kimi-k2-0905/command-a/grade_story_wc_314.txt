<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s harmonizing drive is declared early and remembered but never made to bite; her “secretly sentimental” trait is named twice yet never complicates a choice or costs her anything on the page. The crystal moment is pure affirmation rather than crucible. No contradiction is dramatized; interiority drifts into generic wonder-language (“surge of warmth”) instead of specific, costly micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the crystal+flame image reweights the premise and the starlings reprise, so RR is legible. However, causality is loose—starling “method” is asserted, not demonstrated, and the altar-flame arrives unprompted, undercutting because/therefore linkage. Cost is only vibes; no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection is biased to Elara’s seeker-eye; orchard geography stays coherent and the micro-setting (roots of ancient tree) literally delivers the crystal. Kaleidoscopic waterfall stays backdrop—never constrains choice—so gate for 9+ fails. Still, concise, POV-filtered detail keeps momentum and atmosphere alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic & intuition) is declared, yet pressure never tightens; the crystal is found, not fought for, and the flame poses no risk. No option is narrowed, no price exacted; escalation is purely decorative. Stake remains static, satisfying itself with imagery rather than irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of balance emerges through recurring starling patterns and the crystal-flame fusion, but subtext is undercut by overt thesis lines (“she understood… harmony she sought”). Final paragraph moralizes rather than letting image reconfigure meaning. Complexity is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature favors light, motion, and spiral forms—consistent alchemist-eye. Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no head-hopping or register drift. Syntax is competent but safe; lacks daring compression or sonic pattern that would push higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lucid, and sacrifices neither clarity nor momentum; metaphors stay coherent. However, template cadence creeps in (“She… She… She…” openers; repeated “seemed to” qualifiers) and sentiment drifts toward gently purple uplift rather than knife-sharp specificity. No loop obscures closure, but texture stays politely literary rather than unforgettable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope stack—hidden orchard, wise alchemist, crystal McGuffin—feels refreshed by starling-code concept, yet method remains sketched, not mechanized. Risk is aesthetic rather than narrative; no rule or moral calculus is subverted. A pleasant scent of wonder, but not the shock of new.</comment>
