<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—polymer-chemist lens filters every beat (“molecular bonds,” “structural harmony”). Contradictory impulses (grief vs. lab refuge) collide in the chrysalis beat, embodied in her grip and river-crouch. Micro-choice of climbing out is earned; cost is visible in twilight breath. No secondary character on page, so status bullets N/A; occupation details shape perception and final bridge-metaphor, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: final breath + emergence image reweights separation→connection with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: brother-loss → lab exile → foam insight → bridge choice. Orientation anchored by word 50 (braided ravine, low sun). No teleport, no plot amnesia; chrysalis tracked throughout. Persistent constraint—grief as molecular tension—shapes final image; cost legible in “no longer just a polymer chemist.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ravine is environment-as-crucible: foam patterns narrow her options, rock footing forces crouch→insight. Micro-setting object—chrysalis—constrains grip and metaphor. Sensory hierarchy obeys chemist’s eye: river foam ≈ polymer chains. Final image recharges same twilight ravine, now reweighted. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signaled paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: foam insight forecloses eternal grief-isolation, enables bridge stance. Cost visible in body—breath, steady climb—under causal lens. Agency internal but decisive; no coin-flip resolution. Persistent grief-tension becomes tactical lens for future bonds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from polymer metaphor→life fabric without slogan. Subtext in chrysalis silence: empty shell = both loss and open structure. Final image reconfigures “chemist” identity into living bridge—conceptual repricing. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers in twilight. No echoing thesis line; avoids sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays chemist-tight: diction “symphonically,” “molecular,” no head-hop. Rhythm accelerates at foam-beat via short sensory clauses. Free indirect clean: “she thought of her brother” slides into italic-free memory. No dialogue = no voice convergence; internal cadence mirrors river pulse. Meets 9+ quick minus hairline: one clause edges academic (“conceptual harmony”) but fits POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language sparse, river-to-polymer metaphor consistent, no mixed vehicles. High density: “sun dipped low” = time + color + emotional hue. Strong verbs: “swirl,” “dance,” “cling.” Final line crystallizes without adverbs. No artifact in closure third; read-aloud rhythm breathes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer science + grief ecology rarely seen. Chrysalis as both materials specimen and transformation sign feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk—quiet lyric exit instead of set-piece—heightens resonance. Specificity: braided ravine foam patterns mirror chain entanglement; could not swap setting or metaphor without collapse.</comment>
