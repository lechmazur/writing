<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—her fingers “brushing” the floor, the paper dissolving—yet her interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“inexplicable pull,” “echo the longing in her own heart”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance crystallizes cleanly: she accepts conduit-status, enduring the dissolution of the program and the vanishing guide, a renunciation that forecloses her former silence. Still, the absence of any on-page micro-choice that *risks* tangible loss (time, bodily safety, social credit) keeps the cost more conceptual than visceral. Cap at 6.7 because motivation is legible and coherent but lacks the hairline flaw of embodied cost that would let it reach 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph (“water damage creating images”) and held to the end: the density of water-stains, lantern-flicker, and dissolving paper accruing until the final image reweights silence as gift rather than lack. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ghost vanishes, the program dissolves, Clara stands in resonance—options reconfigured without exposition. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. A −0.3 is applied because the causal chain between “humming melody” and “water ripples in time” drifts toward magical convenience rather than earned physics, slightly dulling the cost edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flooded pit, lantern-light, silt-slick paper, and ankle-deep water are filtered through Clara’s musician senses—she notices “unstruck chords” and reads stains as notation. The opera-house shell functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: the water itself becomes ink, the decaying program becomes score—environment literally composes. Spatial choreography stays clean: she never teleports, the ghost remains stage-left, distance is maintained. The missing 0.1 to reach 8.0 is the absence of a tactile obstacle (cold, submerged cables, rotted music stand) that could have constrained her humming or footing, which would have charged the final image with bodily risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the ghost’s code—threads every beat; escalation is textural: each water-stain reveals more notation, tightening Clara’s attention until she *must* vocalize it. One meaningful deepening occurs when the program vibrates in response to the ghost—knowledge shifts from “possibly random stains” to “deliberate message,” narrowing her options to *sing or fail*. Cost is felt but abstract: the program dissolves, the ghost departs, silence is replaced by resonance—yet no tangible resource is lost. The 7.2 reflects clean pressure under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of a visceral price (bleeding fingertip, voice cracking, lantern snuffed by splash) keeps it below 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “art out of ruin” via concrete returns: water = ink, decay = score, silence = song. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of “lingering resonance” reweights the earlier “hush of unstruck chords” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost’s silence—her outstretched arms conduct, but Clara supplies the sound, implying creation is collaboration across death. The slight abstraction of “gift” keeps it from 8+ band, but the organic emergence from particular images earns solid 7.6.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-limited hovers close to Clara’s musician ear: she hears “unstruck chords,” sees “waterlogged floor,” thinks in metronomic repetitions—“in between spaces” echoed thrice with shifting stress, teaching the pattern. No head-hopping; ghost remains opaque, described only through Clara’s sensory filter. Syntax breathes with the scene—long lyrical sentences for drift, then clipped fragments when the figure appears. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she noticed”) are minimal and voice-motivated. The 8.1 reflects a distinct perceptual signature that modulates under pressure yet never loses clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is selective—water as ink, silence as trapped music—each image returns with reweighted meaning at closure, avoiding purple overload. One paraphrase loop occurs: “in between spaces” appears three times in four sentences; the repetition is purposeful, pattern-taught, but still draws a −0.2 artifact penalty. Information density is high: a single sentence often layers sensory cue, emotional tilt, and plot clue; no scaffolding bloat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Flooded opera-house-as-instrument is fresh, yet “ghost composer leaves final score” is a familiar spine; the transformation comes from the specific method—water damage as notation, musician-as-conduit. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight because the ruin literally *writes* the music. Risk is moderate: lyric repetition, magical causality, but coherence holds. The concept does not retreat into metaphor; it commits to the conceit that decay can finish an unfinished work. Sufficiently particular to earn 7.5, but not radical enough for 8+.</comment>
