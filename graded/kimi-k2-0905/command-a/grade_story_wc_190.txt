<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “teach silence how to comfort” motive is stated early and gently tested by Mira’s agitation, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky micro-choice that costs him anything. His adjustments—steering toward quiet sectors—are smooth, never forcing a trade-off or visible forfeiture, so the renunciation stays conceptual rather than embodied. Mira’s shift is nicely rendered, yet it lands as passenger-side benefit, not crucible pressure on Elias. The result is a warm, serviceable arc that stops short of the felt-cost threshold needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece builds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each hush-drenched locale adds density until the final crystalline stillness reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial’s perfect clarity and Mira’s lighter step together reconfigure meaning without verbal summation, cost legible in the “inner light” glow Elias now guards alone. The pattern is taught early (storm-glass reactions) and paid off in the last image; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: the quiet sectors could sharpen into one forfeited option (time, fuel, social risk) to push this into 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is more than scenery: its sonic geography literally steers the gondola and filters Mira’s recovery. Selective sensory focus—light fracturing into “thousand hues,” jasmine scent at the floating garden—keeps description economical and tethered to Elias’s POV bias toward hush. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating-room syndrome. The micro-setting (storm-glass vial) doubles as setting-as-tool, constraining every course correction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will silence actually heal Mira?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the vial’s indigo swirl forces Elias to pick a quieter sector, narrowing options. Pressure stays situational, accumulating through auditory texture rather than causal reversals; cost is felt but soft (lost time/fare not foregrounded). A single meaningful deepening suffices for this length, yet the absence of any tangible price paid by Elias keeps escalation shy of 7+. Still, the hush-to-clarity cadence cleanly reweights the stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active balm, not absence. The storm-glass mirror-for-the-soul avoids sermon by manifesting first in action (course change) and last in image (pristine clarity). Final line “Silence taught you how to comfort yourself” flirts with thematic echo, but the prior embodied experience earns the utterance, keeping penalty minimal. Subtext in Mira’s closed eyes and Elias’s lone watchfulness lets the reader feel the lingering cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person single POV stays locked to Elias with clean psychic distance; no filter-verb clusters. Perceptual signature—sound-colored vision, liquid metaphors—remains consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse, naturalistic, goal-driven: Elias’s question intentionally breaks hush to test his own thesis. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences in transit, clipped fragments when vial reacts, mirroring calm versus turbulence.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often serves atmosphere, character, and micro-action (“The vial, a gift from a traveler…was both tool and talisman”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent within light/sound physics. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulting hush,” “prismatic towers”) fits the lyric-tinted mode and is taught early. Final line’s “inner light” avoids overwriting by letting the object speak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</answer><comment>The “silent-transit as therapy” premise freshens familiar wounded-traveler terrain by weaponizing acoustics as navigational data. Storm-glass vial repurposes maritime folklore into emotional sonar, an inventive synthesis grounded in tactile cause-and-effect. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Could push higher if Elias faced a counter-temptation to break his own rule, exposing fresh angle on silence-as-commodity.</comment>
