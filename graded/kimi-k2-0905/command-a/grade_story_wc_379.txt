<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara’s “knack for uncovering stories” is asserted rather than shown; the only concrete micro-choice—inserting the locket key—comes gift-wrapped by Mrs. Ellis and carries no visible cost. Interiority drifts into therapeutic gloss (“this felt personal”) instead of embodied contradiction. The ending renunciation (reading the letter aloud) is gentle but not driven by any prior wound or flaw, so the arc feels pre-ordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: locket warmth → curiosity → key reveal → letter → communal sigh. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) rather than a decisive change, but the cost is diffuse—no path is actually foreclosed for Clara. Orientation is clean by sentence four; no lens ambiguity. The mailbox mystery resolves via off-page storytelling rather than earned tactics, keeping it below the 8.0 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dawn courtyard anchors quickly and keeps returning to jasmine scent and cobblestones, grounding every beat. The mailbox is micro-setting as charged object, its lock literally constraining the final move. Spatial choreography stays crisp: bench → mailbox → shadowed doorway → wall. Light and scent evolve with the emotional cadence, adding texture without checklist overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can listening heal?”—is declared late and never tested under pressure; the letter is already forgiving, so Clara’s reading is witness, not agency. No credible loss or tactical change occurs; tension is atmospheric, not consequential. Escalation is a single soft deepening rather than a narrowing of options, satisfying accumulative but not causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the letter’s content and the courtyard’s collective exhale, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in Mrs. Ellis’s ellipses and the unclaimed mail, inviting the reader to infer absences. The locket reprise is present but not re-weighted—its warmth is a cue, not a shifted symbol—so resonance is modest. Final image is quiet, resisting tidy thesis, hence above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person floats cleanly above Clara without head-hop; perceptual signature leans toward antiquarian noticing (“tarnished but its allure undeniable”). Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Mrs. Ellis’s cadence is older, gnomic. Register stays within curator’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with natural rhythm and varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is restrained—only two metaphors, both serviceable. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding (“she realized then that…”) could be carved. No loops, typos, or tense slips; paragraph cuts pass. Closure line is soft but not muddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Premise blends familiar tropes—mystic mailbox, heirloom key, wise elder—without inversion; the locket-key coincidence feels convenient rather than revelatory. Specificity of dawn courtyard and jasmine scent lends local freshness, but plot skeleton is interchangeable with many “lost letter” tales. Emotional specificity (curator who listens) is promising yet under-exploited. Risk level is safe middle; no structural daring.</comment>
