<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli’s gait-reading gift is stated, not dramatized; we never “see” it parse a stride under pressure. The interior contradiction—wanting to prove subtlety yet fearing loneliness—is announced, not embodied. Micro-choice at the lock moment is present but thin; the cost (risk of collapse) is atmospheric, not personal. Mira’s desperation shifts her walk, but Eli’s counter-shift isn’t legible in muscle or breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment> Closure lands as Charged Poise: the passage opens, the duo step into alien light, and the labyrinth’s whisper-rule is reweighted with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—key fits lock, wall recedes—yet the lock’s sudden appearance feels engineered rather than seeded. Map’s self-unfolding is a late rule; no prior beat teaches it can react to bearer motion. Lens is Situational; pressure coheres but the final shift is more scenic than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Container geometry is sketched in motion—“corridors shifting,” “wall stacked impossibly high”—and directly blocks/permits progress, satisfying 9+ gate. Salt-rust air and flickering fluorescents filter through Eli’s maintenance gaze, grounding POV. Spatial choreography holds: map is wedged, key is pocketed, lock is proffered; no impossible placements. Storm’s magnetic pulse remains atmospheric rather than tactile; a missed chance to jar tools or scramble gait-rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“whispers > shouts”—is declared early but only implicitly tested: the labyrinth whispers, thewall yields to a quiet key-turn, yet Eli does not suffer a shouted alternative. Escalation is present (wall rises, storm peaks) but agency is reactive; Mira supplies the lock, Eli merely inserts. No tangible forfeiture (time, injury, social credit) is risked or lost. Pressure tightens situationally yet options never fork between shout-path and whisper-path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the whisper/shout binary; the final image of “whispers carrying farther” reweights earlier container-echoes without moralizing. Subtext is thin—Mira’s taunt carries no hidden plea, Eli’s silence no rebuttal. Zodiac coin and map flirt with symbolism but never return to reprice meaning. Insight stays at bumper-sticker depth; no new emotional aftereffect beyond the stated maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is steady, third-person close to Eli, with metallic cadence (“rhythmic clangs and shuffles”) that suits the yard. Filter verbs are few; perception stays anchored in Eli’s ears and palms. Diction modestly reflects a worker’s lexicon until “calculated spontaneity,” a phrase that lifts above POV license. Dialogue sparse and indistinct; Mira’s diction merges with narration, no regional or class inflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length; opening pair of long clauses breathes, later fragments mirror storm urgency. No synonym loops or template cadences; “walk” recurs but is focal, not filler. One mixed metaphor: “air smelled of salt and rust” is concrete, but “salt and rust” as aroma is slightly off. Final line lands clean without scaffold; momentum carries through the lit passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Core combo—gait-reader + living container maze + geomagnetic storm—feels fresh, not trope-larded. Zodiac coin and self-editing map flirt with fantasy but stay rule-light, avoiding heavy exposition. Premise could collapse into gimmick yet remains anchored to maintenance labor and sensory detail. Whisper thesis risks platitude, but the industrial setting particularizes it; risk taken, clarity kept.</comment>
