<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative—“the texture of time” obsession is particular—but her contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized until the final beat. The shift from discovery to participation is declared, not visibly costed; we see no micro-choice that risks error or burns a bridge. Voice stays consistent, yet the cicada’s agency overshadows hers, muting the crucible effect. Still, the perceptual signature is strong enough to keep her above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cicada reweights time from mystery to lived companion, cost felt in her renunciation of linear chronicling. Causality isAccumulative/Textural—strata of moments stack until pattern breaks in the humming cicada; one tightening suffices. Orientation clean by line 3, no lens drift. The price is oblique—“ready to share its secrets”—so the RR is resonant but not gut-punch; hence 7 not 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grotto as micro-setting is star-lit ceiling, moss stone, tidal pool—selective, tactile, and filters through Elara’s chronicler gaze. Jade cicada serves as portable setting-cum-tool, its carvings literally shifting to constrain her final stance. No spatial drift; celestial tapestry returns in last line, charging the RR. Meets 9+ gate but cap at 8.8 because cicada, not geology, drives the decisive image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“texture of time” discovery—signals at line 5; pressure deepens via cicada’s warming hum that forces renunciation of old method. No external antagonist; tension is epistemic, internal. Escalation is single intensification (stars pulse, cicada re-carves) that reweights her chronicler identity; cost is conceptual loss of linear certainty. Sufficient for length, but price could be sharper on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: truth lives in digression, not straight lines. Subtext carried by cicada’s carved seasons—empire-rise/heart-break strata—rather than authorial comment. No final moralizing; last line offers Charged Poise. Tangential method is asserted but not tested in scene, so theme hovers slightly abstract; keeps it from 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptions; diction—“celestial tapestry,” “tidal-pool chronicler”—is character-specific, not committee voice. Rhythm swells with cardiac cadence in “hum…resonated in her chest,” mirroring content. No dialogue, so register consistency judged in narration only; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct but not yet unforgettable; missing the idiosyncratic syntax that would push 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or synonym churn. Sentence variety strong; paragraph cuts tight. One high-pressure beat—“jade cicada grew warm…melody that resonated”—uses figurative density purposefully and pays off in closure image. Minor elevation toward “celestial tapestry” poeticism acceptable under lyric lens. Clean copy, no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: chronicler who treats time as tidal pool strata, with cicada as palimpsest key. Premise avoids stock mystic-object template by tying insect carapace to concrete seasonal vignettes. Risk is quiet lyric escalation rather than twist—coherence intact. Not fully singular, but synthesis feels organic and memorable.</comment>
