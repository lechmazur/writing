<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal life is vivid—pulse of the arrow-tip syncs with heartbeat, body tilts with planetary inversion—yet her motivations stay anchored in pilot instinct and curiosity. Micro-choices (she steers, presses, steps) map cleanly to stakes, and the final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she remains to become guardian, forfeiting pilot mobility. The “planet’s whispers” line skirts diagnostic cliché but is rescued by immediate sensory reaction. No second character on page; therefore status & relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: arrow fuses, grove erupts, Elara’s role flips from seeker to protector. Causal lattice holds—every hologram burst or river pivot is triggered by object/planet feedback. Orientation crystal by line 5; spatial logic survives gravity flip. One lingering micro-gap: how the arrow physically “mends” is elided, but the reconfiguration cost is legible in her anchored stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Breath and scent shrink distance; floating arches, emerald-lit tunnel, and star-fruit each earn tactile handling. Moss-veined hull doubles as camouflage, constraining flight-path. The orchard river operates as both highway and metronome—its surface “deliberate ripples” direct final approach, thereby charging closure. Micro-setting (arrow) also guides choices, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—planet memory fading—tightens once: echo-dimming ups urgency and forecloses retreat. Elara’s agency steers river, slots arrow, triggers grove revival; luck plays 0% role. Cost is visible—her open-ended guardianship, ship now tethered. Situational lens: pressure mounts environmentally rather than through antagonist, sufficient per short-form guidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through living archive metaphor—planet stores memory in fast-growth flora—without sermon. “Broken becomes whole” reframes resilience from individual to mutual stewardship. Ambiguity lingers: who seeded the stones? unanswered space invites reflection rather than frustration. Final paragraph stays assertive; a hair’s-breadth below the −0.4 moralizing penalty zone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s sensorium; no head-hop. Diction tilts technical only when instrument panels fail; otherwise selects orchard-scented lexicon. Rhythm accelerates through inversion, then lands in long sentence of awed quiet—mirrors emotional arc. Free indirect style clean, no filter-verb clumps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes: short percussive clauses during tilt, lyrical elongation at light bloom. Metaphors organic—“shimmering like stars” specific to fruit cuticles, not filler. One paraphrase hiccup: “the planet’s flora thriving despite its chaotic environment” repeats prior beat; minor −0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold loops, high info-density, clean temporal order.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Core combo—sentient orchard + gravity inversion + memory-storage chlorophyll—yields fresh planetary ecology. Arrow-key trope is antique but reborn as planetary USB, justified by hologram map beat. Risk taken with inversion physics; rules stay internally consistent. Lacks daring structural gamble, keeping it below 8.8 band.</comment>
