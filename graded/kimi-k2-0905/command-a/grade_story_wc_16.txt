<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully reckless” interior contradiction is dramatized in the quill-dip beat and carries into the final image, earning the renunciation of silence. Embodied trembling + micro-choice to write in “language of her heart” give concrete cost. Mentor status shift is legible in single line of dialogue. No label-speak; flaw complicates choice and is accepted, not cured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: broken promise → inkwell quest → apology draft → restored trust. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the path of silence, cost shown in “her heart light for the first time in months.” Orientation anchored by 120-word mark via archive geography + sunlight beams. No teleporting props; inkwell hum cues magic rule early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archive acts as micro-setting: dust, narrow beams, labyrinthine shelves constrain her movement and mirror internal maze. Glass inkwell evolves from myth prop to charged tool that reweights the final image. Sensory economy favors tactile (spines, glass) and auditory (hum) over visual clutter. Spatial choreography clean: she approaches inkwell, dips, writes; Kael placement clear in closing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when she lifts the quill: one chance before paths diverge. Escalation is internal but visible: fear → resolve → ink-flow gamble. Cost legible in vulnerability of non-language inscription and Kael’s still-mixed expression. Coincidence absent; resolution arises from her chosen act, not inkwell magic alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: broken promise → triad of new promises → melody of truth; no explicit moralizing. “Symphonies of truth” reconfigured from abstract myth to lived apology song. Final image of two people walking together under aural metaphor offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids tidy equivalence—she remains flawed, he remains hurt yet hopeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic free-indirect style matches linguist POV: “dust motes danced,” “whirlwind of cautious exuberance.” Diction stays within Elara’s scholarly lexicon without academic detour. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior accessed only through his single spoken line. Filter verbs minimal; repetition (“promise”) is pattern-taught and recharged at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances mood, motive, or milieu. No scaffold loops; paragraph cut test passes. Metaphors coherent (inkwell as key, symphony as trust) and kept to strategic beats rather than every sentence. Final line lands with clean cadence and image-propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of arcane-linguist trope with musical-truth inkwell feels fresh; stakes are relational rather than world-saving. “Interconnected promises” mechanic avoids cliché by anchoring in personal rather than cosmic scale. Transformation test fails if names swapped, but specificity of archive + invented script keeps it memorable. Risk is moderate—quiet restorative magic—but coherence justifies it.</comment>
