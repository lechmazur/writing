<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “grim optimist” interiority is textured through her dice-rolling micro-choices and the chipped-die loss that forces her to renounce retrieval; the contradiction is lived, not labelled. Emotion is embodied in scuffed boots, white knuckles, breath pacing—never abstracted. The final letting-go is earned because the prior beats have dramatized her obsessive clutch; the cost is the mentor’s die itself, gone forever. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted once rather than dramatized in a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the staircase rules reprice when Elara accepts irreversible loss as the price of perpetual motion; the three-spot die re-weights the premise. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of rolls + chalk equations tighten until the chipped die is lost and the remaining three re-casts the quest. No causality breaks; the staircase denies back-tracking without warning, a rule taught by the fallen die’s thunder. Cost is unmistakable: “she couldn’t retrieve it; the staircase would not allow her to retrace her steps.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Infinite staircase functions as micro-setting: its refusal to let Elara descend after the die-loss directly constrains her next move, re-pricing perpetual motion. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—fading chalk, scuffed stone, distant thunder—never touristy. Spatial choreography is clean: die tumbles down, walls pulse, geometry shifts in real time. Final image charges earlier motif: “the walls whispered her name” fuses setting with earned acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of a missed opportunity—tightens when the die-loss forces Elara to convert that desire into letting-go; perpetual motion ideal survives only by embracing impermanence. Escalation is accumulative: each roll thickens the chalk-dust pattern until the seven, then the three, reweight options. Visible price: mentor relic lost, path foreclosed. No external antagonist needed; staircase pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation-chalk and dice images: perpetual motion equals perpetual loss; the ending’s conceptual re-pricing refuses to moralize. Subtext is in the silence after the die-fall—no speech, just footsteps continuing, a quieter answer than any thesis. Final image reweights “boundless confinement” from curse to covenant. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the whispering walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a mathematician’s cadence—measured syntax, equation metaphors—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for theorem-thought, staccato fragments when die slips. “Grim optimist” diction colours every perception; no corporate register drift. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated (“she watched as they landed”). Closure syntax mirrors acceptance: open cadence, no terminal epiphany line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances chalk/roll/stair logic; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physical—dice as relics, staircase as arteries—avoiding purple. “Clatter echoing in vast emptiness” is crisp, not overwritten. Final third is clean: no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Infinite staircase as engine of perpetual-loss motion is a fresh synthesis; dice-pair (flawed/pristine) object duality re-infuses a familiar metaphor. Mathematical proofs pressed into chalk walls particularize the abstract quest. Risk: lyric, low-dialogue ascent could feel chilly, yet embodied beats keep it human. Transformation test passed: swap dice for coins and the emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
