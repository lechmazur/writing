<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied trembling, the tuning fork pressed to her lips—but the “translator of silence” label and “world capsized” summary border on diagnostic speak. Kael appears too late to serve as crucible; their silent exchange is touching yet cost-free. The final renunciation (silence as canvas) is earned by the prior pattern-hunt, but the absence of any tangible price keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the fork’s final vibration reframed as a brush-stroke on silence—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (she forfeits sound forever). Causal lattice holds: Kael’s pattern → joint decoding → fork re-struck; no lucky coincidences. Orientation achieved inside 120 words; single POV stable. Minor slack: the “unshaken marvels” thesis is asserted more than dramatized until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Winterglass panes shimmer like frozen waterfalls—image simultaneously anchors atmosphere and becomes the literal canvas for the heat-map colors. Conservatory’s vegetal life pressing against translucent glass mirrors Elara’s silent search, constraining her to read emotion through temperature rather than vibration. Micro-setting (tuning fork case, stone bench) handled in motion; no static catalogue. Final image of colors blooming on glass recharges the opening description—setting becomes the medium of closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recovering/accepting lost sound—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each failed experiment tightens the trap until the pattern discovery offers a new palette (color-music) in place of sound. Protagonist drives the turn: she chooses to strike the fork not to summon sound but to paint color. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the quest for vibration and embraces silence as medium—visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as absence but as alternate score. Recurrent glass/waterfall imagery shifts from barrier to lens—avoids overt symbol statements. Final image reframes prior desperation into creative agency without moralizing. Slight deduction for the explicit “unshaken marvels” echo in penultimate paragraph; still, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is musicianly—vibration felt in bone, colors as chords. Syntax grows leaner under pressure (“She struck. Colors answered.”) showing rhythmic control. No dialogue contamination; silent signing is described, not quoted, preserving lyric distance. Fork-as-mouthpiece moment is idiosyncratic and memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “frosted ferns,” “veins visible through winterglass” do two jobs—sense data + metaphor. Rhythm varies; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent (glass→waterfall→canvas) and paid off at closure. Minor scaffold: “world had capsized” appears twice—once could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Post-sound apocalypse” risks trope yet is freshened by synesthetic heat-map music and the fork-as-brush twist. Silent linguist ally is a nice inversion of the musician protagonist. Final reconfiguration (silence = canvas) feels inevitable in hindsight. Some conceptual overlap with recent lyrical aphasia stories keeps it shy of 9.</comment>
