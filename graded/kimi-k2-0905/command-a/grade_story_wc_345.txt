<comment>Kael’s shift from restless orchard hand to bell-ringer is legible, but the interior cost is abstract (“restless” tells; we never feel the ache). Elara’s ghostly agency is atmospheric, yet her final fade is foregone, not a renunciation that stings. Secondary cast remain functions—Mira=larvae, Jorin=clapper, Lira=song—so relationship pressure is zero. Still, the collective micro-choices do accumulate to one visible ritual, satisfying short-form scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clean: chalk message → Kael’s memory → scavenger team → bell strike → nebula return; no logistics breaks. Closure is a Decisive Change with sensory cost (sky shimmer, butterfly bloom) that lands on the page. Orientation is secure by line 4. mild −0.3 because the bell’s lost-clapper problem is solved by off-page memory (Jorin “remembered”), not a fresh obstacle; tension plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, bronze butterfly bell, dawn orchard air—each is tactile, not tourism. The bell’s star-etched wings are re-handled during restoration and echo in the nebula’s “waterfall of stars,” giving the final image its glow. Spatial choreography stays crisp: no teleporting tools. Environment does not constrain tactics (arches are scenic, not obstacle), so 9-gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—heal the planet via bell—signaled first paragraph. Escalation is linear, not tightening: each ally finds exactly the piece they need (larvae, clapper, song) without trade-off or reversal. Cost is present but collective and diffuse; no single character forfeits a live option. The nebula’s return feels like reward, not irreversible price, keeping pressure below 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of cooperative restoration emerges through action, not sermon. “Brambled hope” image early / mirrored in blooming orchids at end creates reverb. Final image avoids moralizing; nebula’s light is offered, not explained. One soft −0.2 because “collective effort” is named rather than questioned—no tension between altruism and self-interest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays consistent, no head-hop. Prose leans lyrical—long vowel loops, soft consonants—matching orchard hush. Diction drifts slightly elevated (“brambled hope,” “celestial phenomenon”) but remains in register with mythic tone taught early. Dialogue is absent, so voice test is narrative only; rhythm modulates between hush and bell clang without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; opening line anchors stakes and scent. Two adjacent “the garden” anaphoras create light loop (−0.2). One mixed metaphor—“past and future tangled like vines, and the present was a fragile blossom”—vines ≠ blossom logic, −0.3. Info density high; no scaffold or synonym churn. Line artifacts do not touch closure beat; clarity maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orchard planet + ghost horticulturist + star-bell is fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. “Floating rock arches” feels novel and specific. Transformation test passed: swap setting and bell, story collapses. Risk is moderate—gentle fabulism rather than bold formal experiment—so no bonus. Derivative Premise Guardrail not triggered; premise is non-standard.</comment>
