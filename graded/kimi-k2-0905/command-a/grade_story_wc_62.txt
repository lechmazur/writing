<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—chisel-in-hand, breath-syncing with greenhouse hum—and her contradiction (wanting to “carve grief” yet fearing its impossibility) stays live. However, the decisive shift to seeing grief as “migration” is confessed more than dramatized; the chisel never hesitates or slips, so the cost feels intellectual, not corporeal. Spectral mentor is effectively a second character whose status (dead, once-master) is clear and pressures her, but their dynamic is one-way echo rather than status shift. Still, the earned renunciation—stone becomes testament, not tomb—tracks to prior causality and carries quiet cost in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon→butterfly→chisel pattern tightens rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: final stone hums with “stories it now held,” reconfiguring meaning without tidy payoff. Orientation clean by 120 words; greenhouse, dusk, carver, spectral mentor anchored. Cost is felt—she leaves lighter yet carrying permanent migration—but the tightening beat (decision to etch ribbon pattern) is slightly undersold; more stare than struggle, so the 9+ gate not quite cleared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse glass, fern scent, and butterfly wing-thrum are filtered through a stone-carver’s attention to texture and fracture; environment guides her tactile choices. Micro-setting rule met: the woven ribbon becomes a handheld “site” whose frayed threads mirror marble veins, constraining the final design. Spatial choreography clean—bench, chisel, stone, door tracked without drift. Dusk light shift is used to mark the cadence turn rather than decorative palette. Lacks 9+ only because no environmental detail physically impedes or wounds her; pressure is atmospheric, not instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to give grief a shape—signaled in paragraph two and reweighted from “impossible” to “migration.” One meaningful deepening: ribbon pattern = butterfly flight = carved channel in stone; this conceptual pivot narrows her options to etching motion, not stasis. Cost is conceptual (grief as endless passage) rather than tangible loss of tool, time, or relationships, so legible but not visceral. No external antagonist or reversal, fitting accumulative design; pressure coheres through imagery density, not plot turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: grief as migratory, collective, and iterative rather than monumental. Final image—stone surface “alive with stories”—offers non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext sits in silence between chisel strokes and the spectral mentor’s absent voice; ribbon and butterflies reprice the premise that loss must be fixed. Insight is earned through sensory particulars, not maxims; slight sentimentality in “thundering calm” tag is the only softening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter—glass hums like stone “sings,” butterflies are “fleeting syntax.” No head-hop; spectral mentor kept externalized through memory and reported speech. Syntax mirrors carving rhythm—short clauses when chisel moves, longer accumulating sentences during reflection. Diction remains artisanal (veins, fracture, etch) without thesaurus drift. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on weighted metaphor and sentence music, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; no template runs or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“thundering calm,” “fleeting symphony”—and avoids purple overload. Two minor scaffolding echoes: “across the butterfly migration” and “across the glass panes” create spatial preposition repetition; not severe. Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with clean grammar and tense stability. Closure sentence is crisp, image-driven, no filter clutter. In 9+ range except for the noted echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of graveyard craft, greenhouse ecology, and spectral mentorship feels idiosyncratic; butterfly-as-grief-metaphor refreshes expected stone memento. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulative rather than twisty plot—but coherence justifies the mode. Detail is specific to this carver’s gaze (fern spores on marble, ribbon warp as flight path) and would not transplant intact. Slight proximity to “ancient greenhouse” and “butterfly migration” tropes keeps it shy of 8.5+ originality, but synthesis is thoughtful.</comment>
