<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—spectral endurance vs. the need to intervene—surface in the embodied gesture of offering the coin; the cost is the emotional bleed of absorbing the woman’s despair. Interiority is concrete (“synesthetic currents,” “petals unfurling like secrets”) and tied to action. The micro-choice to hand over the coin reweights both selves, earning a credible renunciation of solitary stasis. Yet the second “version” of Mara remains a near-mirror rather than a fully individuated antagonist, trimming the upper band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s dawn light and the woman’s renewed step reconfigure possibility for both Maras; the cost is Mara’s renewed solitude, felt in the “bittersweet smile.” Causality holds: coin-touch → color shift → emotional transfusion → timeline mend. Orientation is taught early (“the moon hung low…”) and space remains coherent. One soft spot: the mechanism of “echo production” is asserted more than dramatized, a minor ellipsis that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard-garden-fountain micro-complex is tactile and specific: cracked dry basin, moss, night-bloom scent; these details constrain where Mara can stand and where the fracture shimmers. Sensory layering is synesthetic yet filtered through her theatrical ghost-perception. The tarot coin functions as mobile setting-as-prop, its color shifts altering ambient light. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies. The hedge maze never tightens physically around the choice, so environment stops just short of dictating tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“lure possibility from the brink”—is signaled in para 1; pressure tightens when the coin’s colors mirror the woman’s storm, forcing Mara to risk absorption of despair. The single meaningful turn is the coin transfer; it narrows Mara’s option to remain aloof and visibly costs her spectral energy (“warmth spread through her…”). Escalation is accumulative/image-driven rather than causal-chain; stakes stay personal, not cosmic. Cost is legible but externalized in garden light rather than a price that will haunt future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the recyclable nature of performance/self; the orchard stage re-enacts identity until a new script is chosen. Subtext lives in the coin’s color shifts rather than exposition. Nostalgia is the tonal envelope but theme resists moralizing—no “hope wins” statement. The final image of dawn light on the maze offers a non-literal answer: possibility is another encore, not an exit. Complexity is present yet the emotional counter-reading (what if the woman fails again?) is only implied, not weighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush, theatrical, synesthetic—“whispers a symphony, each shadow a memory”—yet stays anchored in Mara’s perception. Patterned diction (“the stage was set…”) is consistent and pays off in the closing line. No dialogue, hence no register clash. Occasional elevated phrasing (“synesthetic currents,” “conceptual repricing”) flirts with exceeding ghost-POV lexicon but remains legible. Rhythm modulates with long vowel cadences that mimic night-bloom opening; no algorithmic repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid but leans on metaphor strings in adjacent sentences (“silver light filtering… shadows… secrets… hues of sound”) creating light density drag. No loops or paraphrase; each sentence adds new sensory layer. Strong verbs (“swaying,” “bleeding,” “shimmering”) and concrete nouns outweigh modifiers. Closure image is clear. One mixed metaphor: “timeline fractured most visibly… air shimmering like heat over a flame” compresses abstract and concrete without teaching the rule, keeping score below 8.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The stage-ghost who senses color-sound and mends alternate selves via tarot-coin-echoes is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes; the orchard-as-theater literalizes the metaphor. Risk is taken with synesthetic lyric mode yet coherence remains. Specific detail (“hand-painted tarot coin,” “dry fountain basin”) prevents abstraction. The encore metaphor could feel meta but is grounded in Mara’s lived loop. Not quite singular enough for the top band because the woman’s fragment reads as generic despair rather than a unique timeline scar.</comment>
