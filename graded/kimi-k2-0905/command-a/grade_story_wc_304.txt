<comment>Elara’s single desire—“to capture one last spark before oblivion”—is declared early and never complicates; interiority stays at a luminous distance, giving no contradictory impulse under pressure. The traveler’s sudden appearance supplies the only micro-turn, yet Elara’s shift from “capture sparks” to “embrace stillness” is gifted rather than earned through visible mis-steps or cost. Her hands tremble once, but body and tool use remain ritualistically gentle, flattening embodied tension. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized: we are told she feels “newfound understanding,” but no prior flaw or obsession is foreclosed with on-page consequence.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald dims, traveler vanishes, and Elara steps forward into an altered stance toward stillness; cost is felt conceptually. Causality, however, is thin—the chip’s power is asserted, not constrained by rules, so the revival beat borders on miracle. Orientation is secure: who/where/when anchored within 60 words. Single continuous scene obeys scope default; one meaningful tightening (infuse → stillness lesson) satisfies escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>“Skyborne grotto,” crystalline walls, and aurora provide a sensory micro-setting that charges the final image; however, spatial choreography is minimal—bodies remain kneel/stand binaries without tactile movement through space. Light and silence are re-filtered through Elara’s attention, achieving POV-biased selection. No props beyond the emerald are handled, so world density is narrow but sufficient for 700-word scope. Setting functions atmospherically rather than tactically; it mirrors mood but never blocks or enables a specific physical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is clear; pressure tightens when the revived traveler reframes the goal to “stillness endures,” forcing Elara to relinquish her method. Yet the reversal is externally authored; Elara’s agency is reception, not a decision that narrows options with visible price. Cost is conceptual (loss of former purpose) but not dramatized—no tool breaks, no relationship severed, no irrevocable act. Escalation is single-turn, adequate for lyric short-form but not viscerally punishing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of stillness-over-spark emerges organically through traveler dialogue and Elara’s final silence, avoiding sermonizing. Subtext resides in the emerald’s dying glow—life that exhausts its source—creating quiet irony. No abstract thesis is stated; meaning is cued by image and cadence. Complexity is modest—one polarity inverted—yet resonance lingers with elegance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: attention to shimmer, breath, hush. Compression is purposeful—“radiant hush” repeats as rhythmic motif, pattern-taught early and reprised at close. Syntax modulates from longer incantatory sentences to fragment-like calm at the end, mirroring stillness theme. Dialogue is minimal and archaic, fitting traveler archetype without flattening; narrative diction stays within Elara’s refined lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and scaffold-free; no loops or synonym churn detected. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Occasional elevated phrasing—“threshold of stillness,” “radiant hush”—is motivated by tone poem mode and does not obscure causality. Two minor adjectival stacks (“shimmering aurora,” “silken shrouds”) are acceptable in compressed aesthetic; they do not stall momentum or muddle the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Beauty-preserving mortician under aurora is a fresh mash-up; the traveler’s counter-argument inverts the revival trope, making stillness the enduring prize. Conceptual risk—quiet ending with no antagonist—pays off through consistent lyric pattern. Specificity is high: emerald chip as life-token that exhausts itself feels inevitable in hindsight. Could edge closer to 9.0 if a sharper personal cost had been exacted from Elara.</comment>
