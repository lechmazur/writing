<comment>Elara’s quiet obsession and scientific lens are credibly sketched; her decision to “experiment” with the dust feels organic to her researcher reflex. Interiority stays concrete—gloves, chill, shimmer—rather than label-laden. Yet her want (“strip away needless drama”) is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes that goal, so change arrives as gentle confirmation, not costly choice. The butterfly materialization is beautiful but externally granted; she is observer, not actor, at the hinge moment.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dust-borne butterfly re-images the entire greenhouse, re-weighting loss into renewal with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density increases until the final cadence shift. Causality is loose but coherent: each sprinkling beat thickens texture, not option tree. The “storm→flood→ruin” anchor is clear by line 3; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse operates as micro-setting: broken glass, brackish soil, damp air constrain movement and echo collapse physics she studies. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile cold and visual shimmer, matching her researcher gaze. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—kneel, stand, watch—no impossible shifts. The butterfly wing dust is handled, not catalogued, so object-as-setting qualifies and charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>Stakes are existential-aesthetic: can meaning be re-grown from ruin? Pressure is situational and accumulative—each dust pattern thickens the texture of possibility rather than narrowing external options. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the butterfly appears as culmination, not cost-based choice. Tightening is present but gentle: pattern recognition → anticipation → wonder; suffices for sub-800-word lyric arc.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges throughparticulars: neutron-star decay ↔ greenhouse decay ↔ butterfly dust regeneration. No character lectures us on impermanence; the image-argument is shown. The final reconfiguration reframes gradualness itself as creative force—an answer without a moral. Ambiguity is handled: we feel awe, not certainty, sustaining aftertaste.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s scientific perceptual filter—shimmer, frame, soil chemistry. Syntax is calm, slightly formal, miriting her deliberate temperament; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Prose is texture-driven rather than plot-driven, a valid choice under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean, each advancing image or pattern. Occasional stacked modifiers (“once-lush sanctuary for exotic plants”) flirt with purple but stay legible. No paraphrase loops; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“dust…a quiet architect”—is forgivable and image-rich.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics + butterfly dust + ruined greenhouse feels fresh, not modular. The premise risks whimsy but commits to scientific tone, earning suspension of disbelief. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric ending instead of dramatic showdown. Specific detail (Amazon fieldwork vial) keeps it from generic eco-allegory.</comment>
