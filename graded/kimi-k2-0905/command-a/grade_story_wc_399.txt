<comment>Elara’s interiority is textured (“strangely honest heart” drives the consecration micro-choice) and the mask/line-walker identity seeds contradiction, yet the beat sequence is mostly ritual enactment rather than a pressured fork with visible cost; the prophet’s arrival is external confirmation, not a crucible that forces her to gamble or renounce. No secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship dynamics and status shifts are absent by scope. The consecration glow is the sole embodied moment; thereafter emotion is stated (“ached,” “solace”) not shown under escalation. Earned stasis is claimed but the price feels off-page—she walks away lighter than the ritual weight implies.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: consecration → parapet awakens → clearings shift is legible and sequential; the prophet’s arrival supplies the promised pivot, landing a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean within 40 words; spatial anchors hold. Stakes are declared early (“echo of wisdom might vanish”) and tighten to personal legacy, but no fork narrows her options—ritual success is never jeopardized—so escalation is ceremonial, not consequential. No object or rule break; causal chain intact, just low-torsion.</comment>

<comment>Silken pavilion, breathing stones, and sand underfoot are viscerally layered; the kinetic parapet reappears with charged glow, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final ritual beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s walker priorities—she notices pulse, grain, whisper cadence. World-rule (“conjured clearings”) is learned through action, not exposition. Minor over-branding: “whisperfield calm” is repeated thrice, risking incantatory stall, but cadence supports tone.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echo—signals early and deepens through parapet renewal, but pressure plateaus: no obstacle, resistance, or trade-off surfaces; success is unopposed. The prophet’s imminence acts as clock yet arrives post-resolution, so time does not force tactical change. Consecration is agency-driven, cost is conceptual (future responsibility), meeting minimal 8-band bar, but without visible loss the escalation feels decorative rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship versus inevitable change emerges through ritual action and final image of fading footprints; no explicit thesis stated. The kinetic parapet as living artifact reprises at closure, reweighting legacy as ongoing pulse—“echo” transmutes from sound to stone energy. Ambiguity is preserved: world will shift, wisdom may still fade. Avoids moralizing; resonance is modest but earned.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close sustains Elara’s perceptual signature—peripheral flickers, mask brush, whisper hum—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax flexes from lyrical elongated phrases to clipped ritual utterance, mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so voice coherence is intra-focal. Diction stays within wanderer-poet register; “consecrate,” “conjured,” “kinetic” feel native to world rather than thesaurus splash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—long sentences for pavilion hush, staccato for dagger reach. Figurative layer is dense (“silken walls rippled with faint hum”) yet consistent; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold pair: “the whispers might vanish forever” is restated almost verbatim late; mild loop, not closure-touching. Opening and closing images (mask adjust / footprints erased) frame effectively. High density, minor loop keeps below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy custodian trope is refreshed by “line walker” half-mask and living stonework; parapet-as-circuit is concrete and specific. Whisperfield as ambient prophecy archive offers quiet world-building not seen in stock chosen-one arcs. Integration of honesty trait into ritual authority rather than moral saintliness avoids cliché. Risk is formal—quiet lyric over dramatic—but coherence justifies the wager.</comment>
