<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-versus-survival contradiction is embodied in the micro-gesture of whittling while blank-faced; the dried bouquet as brother-proxy gives every beat a concrete cue. Interiority stays specific (“the knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation—carving a heart she can never display—earns its cost through the earlier brother-loss anecdote. Still, the performance mask itself is told more than dramatized; we never see her almost slip in public, so the “morally ambiguous” trait feels asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whittled heart pressed to the window reweights the mandate’s silence and makes the cost legible. Causal chain holds: brother’s death → bouquet relic → secret whittling → heart object → pressed against glass = refusal foreclosing exposure. Single-scene orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The one soft spot: the mandate’s enforcement mechanism is off-stage, so the stakes tighten more conceptually than concretely, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Farmhouse/turbine shadow is immediate, tactile, and filters every beat: blades “slice” air that Elara feels as surveillance. The dried bouquet and whittled shavings act as micro-setting that constrain choice—she hides them, then positions them on the sill. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Wind-turbine scale could use one more lived detail (oil smell, low-frequency thrum) to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—private grief vs mandated joy—tightens once: the heart is finished and placed in view, crystallizing risk. Escalation is textural: each wood shaving adds density to the silence until the final object makes refusal tangible. No external enforcer appears, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; cost is felt but not compounded by new obstacle. Sufficient for the length, yet lacks a mid-scene spike that would push 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of happiness as violence; the whittled heart literalizes “lightness in grief” without sermonizing. Final image re-prices the premise: a forbidden emotion carved into physical form, hidden in plain sight. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing wood to glass) rather than statement. One minor echo: “remade hush” borders on prompt-speak, blunting resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; syntax mirrors her mechanical restraint (“movements deliberate yet mechanical”). Free-indirect line “the knife cuts, the wood yields” carries rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Turbine drone and wood-scrape supply sonic texture in lieu of speech; register never drifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrase (“conceptual void she had mastered”) nudges toward abstraction but occurs outside the closure beat. Strong sentence variety and paragraph cuts that advance stakes. One mixed moment: “morally ambiguous figure” is tell-phrasing that could be shown through riskier action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Happiness mandate is familiar dystopic turf, but the whittling of contraband emotion into a palm-sized heart gives it fresh tactile spin. Turbine shadow as surveillance metaphor feels inevitable yet not overused. Story’s risk is quietness—no chase, no snitch neighbor—trusting image to carry rebellion; this restraint is admirable but limits wow-factor. Specificity of brother’s bouquet and wood species could push it past 8+.</comment>
