<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s desire to redeem the family name is clear, but interiority slips into paraphrase (“he wanted to be heard”) rather than embodied contradiction. The lattice as inherited guilt is evocative, yet the turn away from “hush” to “truth” is declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something tangible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias rejects the ancestral silence and claims a new identity, visible in the final hover. Causal chain is thin—journal discovery alone pivots motive—so the price feels conceptual rather than earned through escalating beats; still, the lens (Causal) holds and orientation is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Copper-lit ore veins and salt-rotted stone create tactile prison atmosphere; the lattice functions as micro-setting that guides descent and final refusal. Reef and lighthouse remain backdrop—never actively constrain escape—so environment stops short of charging the ultimate image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom via truth before bodies surface—is signaled early. Yet pressure plateaus after journal reveal; no intermediate beat tightens the ticking clock or raises physical risk. Escalation is present but single-stage, capping tension at functional rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of inherited credibility versus self-authored truth emerges through lattice and lighthouse silence; final renunciation reweights “cry wolf” legacy without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the guards’ vanished bodies carried personal consequence for Elias beyond abstract guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s sensorium; diction (“copperlight repose,” “thread the labyrinth”) is consistent and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward poetic template but remains legible; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent arc; sentences vary and cut cleanly. One paraphrase loop (“he wanted… he wanted”) and a filter stack (“he thought of… he realized…”) slightly dull the climax; metaphors stay coherent. No artifacts touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Inverting the boy-who-cried-wolf into a parable about choosing audible truth over family silence feels fresh; lighthouse-as-confessional-prison and guilt-mining ore are specific syntheses. Risk is moderate—mythic overlay could veer familiar—but particulars keep it memorable.</comment>
