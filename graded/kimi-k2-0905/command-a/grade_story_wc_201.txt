<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and body-centric, but the “mathematics of mercy” remains an abstract label; no concrete equation or test is attempted, so motivation never modulates under pressure. The mask-strap drop registers as symbol-only release rather than a micro-choice that costs her something new. Still, trauma responses are embodied well, and her senses sharpen present-tense tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the strap’s splash is a CR image that reweights the premise—pain stays, but purpose is re-priced. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the forest’s intensifying glow substitutes for escalating stakes, satisfying the lens. Time and space anchor within 120 words; orientation test waived because disorientation pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is not postcard scenery: the glowing roots literally guide her footing, and the humming bark pulses against her spine, constraining every step. Micro-setting succeeds: the pewter strap acts as portable setting/object that charges the final image when it sinks. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her enhanced proprioception, filtering noise into relevant tactical data.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—“find the formula for mercy”—is declared early but never tested by an external obstacle; pressure is atmospheric, not optional-costly. The forest’s intensifying light provides a single cadence shift that reweights stakes from search to acceptance, satisfying accumulative escalation. No visible price is paid (no wound, forfeiture, or foreclosed path), so the tightening stays lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy reinterpreted as integration of pain rather than erasure. The returning ultraviolet light and sinking strap reweight the premise without moralizing. Abstract prompt phrase “mathematics of mercy” is thankfully never translated into literal math, avoiding thesis-speak; instead the final image offers conceptual repricing that invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains rhythmic pulse and ultraviolet diction throughout; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are few and justified by heightened proprioception. Syntax mirrors her sensory overload—long clauses breathe, then tighten into short fragments at the strap release. Distinct perceptual signature achieved without experimental clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned early (“trees hummed”) and paid off at climax. One paraphrase loop around “pain into purpose” is minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sensory verbs stay specific. Final sentence lands with imagistic snap, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Enhanced-interrogation survivor seeks mercy-equation inside a sentient ultraviolet forest—fresh synthesis of cyber-trauma and eco-psyche. The proprioceptive sense as both gift and scar feels non-obvious and drives bodily stakes. Risky lyric structure holds; restraint avoids tech-thriller clichés. Not quite unforgettable, but angle is genuinely new.</comment>
