<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trembling certainty” embodies the dare/renunciation axis—but the punch’s hold on her is asserted more than dramatized; we see her raise it, not feel the cold brass sear her palm or alter her pulse. The blank ticket moment is the only visible cost, and it lands cleanly, so the arc satisfies the 9- gate, yet the absence of a second beat where the punch actually hurts or brands her keeps it just shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: punch → arrows → gates → blank ticket → punch, each step a because/therefore that narrows her option to ‘map’ toward ‘embrace un-mappable.’ The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the ticket’s emptiness reweights all prior mapped routes as obsolete. Cost is legible in the final image—she stands ticketed but destination-less—but the price is still more conceptual than corporeal, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the phantom punch is a tactile tool whose shifting symbols constrain every onward step; the starlit vault’s mist curls round ankles like a living thing, turning weather into antagonist. The brass coldness returns in the final breath, charging the exit image. Few broad landscapes are needed—this is a story of palm, metal, and breath—so economy wins over panoramic excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she map or leap?—tightens once, at midnight, when the cracks arrow her away from the safety of charts. The punch-ticket act is the visible price, foreclosing her old identity in a single click. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word terrain; no secondary reversal is required, yet the lack of an external cost (lost blood, broken compass) keeps it just below the high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as shields against chaos, abandoned when the world itself starts drawing arrows. No moral is stated; the blank ticket’s silence reprices every prior line she ever inked. The only near-misfire is the fortress mirrors’ therapy-adjacent phrasing (“truths she had buried”), but the images are concrete enough to escape heavy Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; diction—“cartography of doubt,” “brass cold to the touch”—is precise, rhythmic, and biased toward her vocation. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. The lyric cadence of mist and starlight is patterned early and paid off in the closing constellation realignment, meeting the 9- gate for voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences switch length to mirror breathless walk versus crystalline pedestal moment; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Only micro-slip: “as though it had been waiting for her all along” appears twice—once for punch, once for gates—an echo not quite justified by motif necessity. Otherwise density is high and metaphors stay physically coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ‘phantom ticket punch that demands self-punching’ is a fresh synthesis of铁路-gothic and cartography-magic; the blank ticket as passport to unmapped life reframes a familiar metaphor. Risk is taken—fortress of mirrors could have slid into cliché—but the specificity of her past cartographic errors reflected back keeps it transformed. Not quite 9 because the core conceit still nods to well-trodden ‘mystical object tests protagonist’ trope, albeit with new varnish.</comment>
