<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eira’s interiority is vivid—her storm of guilt over the failed barrier anchors every step into the vortex. The contradictory impulses (guard vs. confess) act simultaneously; the “I failed” whisper is the earned hinge. Cost is felt: her cloak is tugged, her boots sink, her warlike serenity cracks—embodied, not labeled. One micro-slip: “warlike serenity” is repeated rather than re-seen under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the plant roots stabilize the lake while Eira’s confession reweights her self-image. Causal lens holds throughout—each circle is a because/therefore step toward surrender. The seed’s glow and the vortex’s calm are the visible price. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop—it narrows her path, dictates the surrender rhythm, and ultimately houses the plant that rewrites the rules. Micro-setting triumph: the seed’s pulse against palm becomes the axis of choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—scent of rot then crisp air mirrors internal thaw. One minor over-tell: “otherworldly glow” could be shown through Eira’s retina rather than adjective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—tightens exactly once: the seed forces confession, foreclosing lifelong self-erasure. Escalation is situational pressure, not multiple reversals; sufficient at this length. The price (public self-accusation) is on-page and alters her stance forever. No secondary stake clutters the frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: seed = buried truth, vortex = self-confrontation, plant = confession devouring chaos. No moralizing; final line’s “quiet resolve” is a charged poise that reweights the opening “warlike serenity.” Subtext lives in gesture—tighter seed grip equals rising shame. Minor echo: “what mirrors don’t show” is named twice; once would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Eira’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“moss-covered ground,” “flesh-eating plant seed”—is concrete, non-generic. Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences as vortex tightens, then exhales in clean final line. Filter verbs minimal; one near-flaw: “she sensed” could drop for immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold, high density: each sentence moves setting, body, or stake. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. Final sentence lands with tactile crispness and conceptual reprice. One near-repeat: “swirling orchard” appears twice; second could be pruned to “spiral of trunks.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Seed-as-mirror is fresh; druid-plus-flesh-plant remixes tropes but feels inevitable here. Risk taken in lyric surrender structure pays off. Not quite 8.5 because “cursed lake” and “chaos vortex” flirt with generic placeholders; a sharper proper noun or regional detail could push higher.</comment>
