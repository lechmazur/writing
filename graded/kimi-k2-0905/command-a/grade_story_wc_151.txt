<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s “carefully inventive” trait is shown through tactile decoding and the clipboard-as-shield, but interiority lapses into abstract labels (“sense of futuristic nostalgia”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels performed, not cost-bearing; no flaw compounds or forecloses a path. Still, micro-choices (kneeling, trembling hands) align with motive and the pacing of discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chalk coordinates → mailbox → letter → call-to-action chain is legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn light reconfigures Lyra’s stance, cost felt in “echoes of the past remained.” The mailbox beat lands on-page, but the letter’s “masterpiece” content is summarized, blunting the decisive change punch. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 6; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Golden arcade’s pillars, dew-muted chalk, and watermark envelope are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lyra’s decoder gaze. The clipboard micro-setting functions as tool-shield, constraining her stance at the mailbox. Dawn light evolves from “soft ethereal glow” to “full light,” mirroring knowledge shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning before the letter mails”—tightens when chalk coordinates reveal live mailbox deadline. Agency drives escalation: Lyra deciphers, kneels, traces, opens. Cost is conceptual (world moved on, past echo remains) rather than visceral; no tangible loss alters later tactics. Coincidence limited to finding unmailed letter, which complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: physicality of mail vs. speed of digital, preservation vs. progress. Final image of dew-muted chalk reweights earlier drawings as fragile archives. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “echoes.” Subtext resides in chalk-as-code and watermark symbol, not exposition. Insight earned through tactile discovery, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays stable; perceptual signature sharp (“clipboard now a shield against the growing light”). Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Time was running out” accelerate heartbeat. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Diction remains within Lyra’s lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Rhythm mirrors dawn swell without monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and propulsion strong; information dual-loaded (“golden arcade shimmered with soft, ethereal glow” sets scene + stakes). One paraphrase loop: “echoes of the past remained” restates prior nostalgia; −0.2. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Chalk-code as dead-drop method feels fresh; juxtaposition of children’s play with clandestine message is non-obvious. Premise isn’t template-bound, yet transformation test shows arc could survive with different relic-comm device. Specificity of watermark symbol and dawn timing adds memorable angle. Risk modest but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
