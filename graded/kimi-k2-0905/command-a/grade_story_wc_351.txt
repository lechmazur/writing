<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “helix-minded” label is vivid but never dramatized in a contradictory choice; the memory-imprint act is reported rather than performed under stress, so the cost feels abstract. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she understood her purpose”) instead of embodied contradiction. The renunciation at the end is declared, not foreclosed by prior micro-choices, keeping the arc functional but not crucible-tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror becomes a portal that reweights her mission, and the cost is the surrender of her private memories to public ghosts—felt in the final image. Causal chain is thin: synaptic-plasticity method is introduced late and never constrained, so the decisive act reads as convenient rather than inevitable. Orientation is clear by word 80; one soft transition (memory paragraph) is handled with a spatial cue, satisfying the two-shard default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Canyon is sketched with selective lunar detail; the mirror’s jagged edge and moon-glitter serve as micro-setting that ultimately charges the final image. Weather and terrain stay consistent, but no environmental feature ever blocks or enables a specific action—description is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sensory hierarchy favors visual gloss; a single tactile moment (fingers on shard) keeps it above generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams via memory transfer—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: she risks mind-fracture, but the risk is stated, not tested on-page; no intermediate complication narrows options. The final reconfiguration is earned conceptually, yet the absence of a visible price during the act keeps the escalation just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory as civic duty emerges through the mirror’s transformation rather than authorial assertion. Subtext operates in the shift from private nostalgia to custodial responsibility, but the piece leans on one overt line (“she was...guardian of the dreams”) that slightly dilutes resonance. Final image of closer stars supplies quiet repricing without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s spirit if not its full punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays stable and filtered through Elara’s engineer-perceiver: “synaptic plasticity,” “fractured relic,” etc. Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence for memory vines, shorter clauses at the shard setting—without losing clarity. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction remains within her plausible lexicon. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to come alive”) is minor enough to keep high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but leans on abstract intensifiers (“quaking reverie,” “profound transformation”) that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Information density is high—each paragraph advances premise or image. One mixed metaphor (“memories entangled like vines in her mind” alongside “shards of glass”) creates momentary visual blur, not fatal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Archaeologist of abandoned dreams” is a fresh vocational hook; coupling it with memory-imprint via broken periscope gives a novel ritual. Concept risks familiar “save humanity’s lost hopes” uplift, but the engineer’s materialist method keeps it from pure sentiment. Final star-image is quiet rather than boldly transformative, so the piece stops just short of true risk-distinction bonus.</comment>
