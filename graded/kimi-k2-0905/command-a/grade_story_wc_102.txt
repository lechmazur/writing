<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush—her trembling hands, breath slowing, the pendant’s weight “anchoring her to the moment”—but the internal contradiction promised in the 9+ gate (competing impulses acted in-scene) never arrives. She moves from wonder to wonder without a micro-choice that visibly costs her; the moment she might refuse or cling is skipped. The earned change (she leaves “ready to heal the world”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels imported rather than paid on-page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant in Kwan Yin’s palm reimages prior guilt into forward mission, light “enveloping her” with felt warmth. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each wisteria spark adds density until the beam reweights her stance. No persistent constraint or price is shown (she keeps the pendant, no physical or social toll), so the cost is only atmospheric, not tactical. The lens holds—twilight bloom as accretive pattern—but the beat stops just short of undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s iron ribs, scented wisteria, and “skeletal ribcage” metaphor are viscerally selective and mirror Elara’s exposed-nerve mood. Micro-setting works: the pendant’s hollow and the alcove statue physically constrain the final placement, charging the image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Economy is strong; every descriptor either guides her knee or frames the light beam. Could reach 9+ if the setting later constrained her tactics (e.g., rusted ladder snaps, forcing a renunciation), but it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“to find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and narrows to the pendant’s cradle. Escalation is textural: each spark thickens the air until the single beam forces a stance crystallization. No visible price is extracted (no cut hand, no bye-bye to former self on-page), so cost is present but soft. Agency is present—she kneels, places, accepts light—but the tightening deepens mood more than options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stored/unspent love as karmic debt paid by receptivity, not penance. No moralizing sentence articulates the thesis; the final glow is the answer. Subtext is carried in objects—pendant, hollow palm—rather than commentary. Ambiguity is preserved: she may still fail to spend this love. The tear’s migration from temple dream to viaduct iron re-prices “unused” as portable, not buried, a quiet conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices lens flare, scent shift, iron temperature. Syntax lengthens and softens with breath, mirroring twilight diffusion. No head-hop; unreliability never claimed. Diction—“camera obscura artist,” “Kwan Yin’s tear”—is specific yet within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: short sentences under sparks, longer cadence during memory flood. Distinctive texture without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Density is high: a single sentence often layers scent, memory, and motion. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. One mixed-metor risk—“skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria”—reads as intentional body/flower fusion, not slippage. Closing line is crisp and propels: “her steps lighter, her heart fuller,” avoiding explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Past-life + compassion talisman is familiar, but the “pilgrim of sparks” trope is freshly literalized as magnetized wisteria nodes guiding footfall. Transformation test passes: the viaduct’s specific iron scent and camera-obscura framing could not swap into another tale without collapse. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence stays high. No close echoes of iconic scenes.</comment>
