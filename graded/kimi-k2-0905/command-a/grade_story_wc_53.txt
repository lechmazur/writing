<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s regret and her “negotiation with her own ghost” are viscerally embodied in the static crackle of the camera wheel; the contradictory impulses—cling to fragments vs. step forward—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final micro-choice (standing, wheel in hand) is causally keyed to the voiced plea, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority occasionally drifts toward therapeutic self-tagging (“regret clung like a second skin”), keeping the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lagoon’s renewed shimmer plus Mara’s forward step reconfigure meaning with undeniable emotional cost. The causal chain (wheel → voice → stand) is tight; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fragments thickens until the final cadence shift. One scaffold loop (“fractured stillness” twice in four sentences) slightly dulls the final image, preventing 9+.</comment>

<comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds is never generic; its water-currents “danced to rhythms no one could hear” and the soft mud at the edge literally guides Mara’s boot placement. The camera wheel’s cracked lens gleam is reused as a compass-hum, satisfying micro-setting use. Spatial choreography is pristine; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she reassemble a self worth inhabiting?”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each fragment collected adds density until the wheel-voice tightens the cord. The cost is felt when she realizes the ghost is “guide” not enemy; option space narrows to forward motion. No causal reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—broken gears, cracked lens, fractured stillness—rather than exposition. Final “fractured stillness” reweighted as “beginning” supplies conceptual repricing without moralizing. One hairline slip: “rebuild what’s broken” edges toward thesis-statement, preventing 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric carries a distinct perceptual signature: ears strain for “rhythms no one could hear,” eyes track “faint gleam” amid mud. Syntax modulates—long breathless clauses for lagoon shimmer, staccato fragments when static voice hits. No head-hopping; compression (“She began to walk…”) is taught early and paid off in final step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Minor scaffold: “fractured stillness” repeated within 60 words; one paraphrase loop on “lagoon’s currents” / “currents that danced.” No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Information density is high—“the object was peculiar, its gears half-buried, its lens cracked but still gleaming” does triple duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic memory-scavenger trope is refreshed by the cloud-top lagoon and the camera-wheel-as-oracle device. The “ghost” reframed as inner guide feels inevitable yet not clichéd. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure could have collapsed into vagueness, but specificity of sensory filter saves it. Hairline deduction for near-familiar scavenger archetype.</comment>
