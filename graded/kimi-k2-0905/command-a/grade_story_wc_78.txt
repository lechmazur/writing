<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leeward’s interiority is lyrically voiced but stays observational; he never makes a risky micro-choice that costs him anything. The “restlessness” is declared, not dramatized through bodily tension or tool handling. His final peace feels shipped in rather than earned by visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last swirl of clouds and the hush of sea re-weight the premise with felt aesthetic cost. Causality is loose-lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. The Orientation Test is waived; driftwood and blue-hour cues anchor by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard is tactile—gnarled branches creak like cellos, driftwood gives under bare feet—and the micro-setting (driftwood xylophone) literally constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a tide prophet notices salt-hum, wind direction, resonant wood. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the swaying deck.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes are abstract—restore cosmic dissonance—so pressure feels aesthetic rather than tactical. Escalation is accumulative: successive notes thicken cloud fractals, but the protagonist is never cornered or forced to trade one thing away. Cost is present only as atmospheric sublimity, not as forfeited option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: turning obstacle into instrument is shown via the driftwood xylophone and fractal clouds, never preached. The final image reframes restlessness as “restless euphony,” a resonant re-configuration that avoids moralizing. Subtext remains slightly diffuse because stakes are purely cosmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Leeward’s sea-tuned perception; diction is salted, rhythmic, syntactically varied. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Compressed elisions (“sketched resonance”) are taught by context and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, metaphor-rich yet uncluttered; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers sound, sight, motion. A few adjectival swells (“breathtaking pattern”) flirt with overwrite but occur post-climax and do not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard + cloud-fractal music is a fresh synthesis; tide-prophet using driftwood xylophone feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is taken with purely aesthetic stakes, but coherence holds. The trope of prophet-who-heals-chaos is familiar, yet the marine acoustic twist reframes it.</comment>
