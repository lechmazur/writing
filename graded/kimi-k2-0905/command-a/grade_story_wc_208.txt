<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s artisan-observer identity is vivid in the opening beat, but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure; her decision to slot the slide is credible yet emotionally flat because interiority lapses into thematic paraphrase (“scaffold complexity with simplicity”) instead of embodied contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned stasis at the end (accepting custodianship) carries modest cost but feels more conceptual than personally lacerating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: slide discovery → compulsion → arch passage → paired-slide epiphany → custodian vow, each beat a therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (storm-arch); closure lands with conceptual repricing (map of ideas) and visible cost—Mara forfeits sole authorship to become conduit. One minor lapse: the GPS failure is mentioned after the fact, not shown constraining initial navigation, blunting the stakes beat fractionally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-arch, chamber, and slide function as micro-setting; the wind’s cessation cues the hidden passage, literally altering her available moves. Salt scent and stone carvings are filtered through sculptor’s tactile bias; the final pedestal reprises the slide’s pattern, linking body-tool-environment. Weather shift from chaos to hush operates as causal gate, not backdrop; could edge higher if slide’s glass edges physically cut or constrain her grip under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem past knowledge through art—surfaces early; pressure tightens when the slide’s glow reveals the passage, forcing a literal step into inherited responsibility. Agency is present (she slots the slide), but escalation is single-stage; the cost is conceptual rather than a forfeited object or bodily risk. Coincidence is avoided; the storm’s hush feels like responsive ritual, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the slide’s re-envisioning of driftwood into lineage; the map-as-idea reframes art as intergenerational collaboration, avoiding preachiness. Subtext whispers in the hush of wind and mirrored patterns; the ending’s conceptual repricing invites reflection without moralizing. A trace of thematic echo in the final paragraph (“scaffold complexity”) nicks the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sculptor sensorium—calloused hands, pattern-seeing eyes; diction favoring “etch,” “grain,” “carve” sustains artisanal texture. Rhythm swells and contracts with storm tempo; no head-hopping. One register creep: “conceptual repricing”-type phrasing sneaks into narration, barely above her plausible lexicon, but brief enough to hold the 8-line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-dense; sentences open varied, no template cadence. One paraphrase loop—“patterns seemed to dance / forming images of people, places, and events she couldn’t comprehend”—subtracts fractionally. Metaphors stay physically coherent (storm-as-plotter). No artifact touches closure; the final line’s turbine-hum reprise is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing lantern-slide nostalgia with climate-gothic archaeology feels fresh; driftwood sculptor as knowledge-keeper reconfigures maker tropes. The slide’s double-activation ritual is foreshadowed by mirrored carvings, so reveal feels inevitable in hindsight. Concept doesn’t transcend its parts, but synthesis is specific and memorable.</comment>
