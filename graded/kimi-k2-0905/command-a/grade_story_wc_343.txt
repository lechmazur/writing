<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—finger on the dog-ear, breath catching, notebook clutched—yet her internal contradiction (isolation vs need for connection) is only stated, never dramatized. The final beat of “smiled, isolation melting” is declared, not earned; no visible cost attaches to her decision to follow the beam. Still, micro-choices (tracing symbols, muttering Latin, trembling hands) track a believable arc from observer to actor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each symbol decoded literally opens the next physical path (board → beam → hatch → map). Closure is a clean Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the map shimmers with the same light as the orbs, making the before/after legible and charging “Persevera” with earned cost—the mentor vanished pursuing this exact light. Only nit: the hatch has never been noticed before, a mild teleporting-prop bump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass hull, amber twilight, starling murmurations, and the crystalline orbs are all sensory, selective, and filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. The hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains every beat—she kneels, traces, mutters—until it literally beams direction; airship ribs and engine hum remain tactiley present. Final image of murmurations forming a compass rose reweights the setting itself into a living map. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 30.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find stranded luminance before the unknown claims her like it claimed Thorne”—tightens once: the board’s beam forecloses the option to keep studying from safety, forcing descent into cold darkness. Cost is visible: isolation crystallized in the ladder descent, pulsating light replacing engine hum, map ink shimmering with same trapped light she sought. Agency is continuous; each decoding act narrows her next physical move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of pursuit-as-isolation emerges through the starling shape-shifting into compass rose—community forming guidance she lacked. “Persevera” reweights from mentor’s motto to her own lived price without sermon. Subtext is in gesture (trembling hands, breath catch) rather than declaration; ambiguity remains whether the map will rescue or consume her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays anchored in Elara’s perceptual filters—brass gleam, dog-ear fray, engine hum—without leakage. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She smiled, her sociable isolation melting away”) mirroring breathless ascent. No dialogue to fault; free indirect style cleanly toggles between lyrical exposition and sensorimotor action. Latinate whisper (“lumen via, lux perennis”) feels authentic to her phrasebook ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long amber twilight sentences contract into single-line beam commands. Information density high: one sentence can layer engine hum, starling echo, and symbolic pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; “stranded luminance” never repeated without new physical correlate. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Minor purple flicker—“ethereal glow ... suspended in crystalline orbs”—but forgiven as it lands at climax where image reweights theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines antique airship, living starling compass, and hopscotch-cipher into a fresh speculative cocktail; the board-as-sextant feels inevitable in hindsight. Star murmuration forming compass rose is a risk image that pays off by literalizing theme. Loses top tenth because “stranded luminance as crystalline orbs” edges toward familiar videogame loot; still, its integration with ink-shimmering map keeps it from cliché.</comment>
