<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—breath, chill, trembling hands—but the “deep sorrow” she decodes from the prism is relayed as an external fact rather than a contradiction she must metabolize. The moment she “understood that emotions absorbed by objects were not just data” is declared, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that costs her anything. Still, her perceptual filters (frost map, quartz hum) individuate her and sustain a credible mystic stance. The arc lands as earned stasis, but the price feels conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s “truthful lie” reweights every prior refraction of light. Causal chain holds—because she chooses to read grief in glass, her theory is proven yet morally complicated. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of frost/light imagery intensifies until the final rainbow reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the heavier air itself, a rare CR that needs no bodily wound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quartz arbor’s diffuse glow and muting mist are not backdrop but tools that amplify her ritual; the prism’s facets act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Frost on a car window is recalled as an emotional Rosetta stone—an elegant, POV-specific filter. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hands hover, prism turns, rainbows pool at her feet. The arbor’s hush literally thickens, forcing her attention inward—setting-as-constraint that satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb feeling”—is signaled early and tightens when the absorbed grief threatens her composure. One meaningful deepening: blank silence → whispered sorrow → ache in her own heart. Agency remains hers: she could abandon the prism but cradles it instead, accepting the moral cost of knowledge. The price (conceptual heaviness, future burden) is visible in the arbor’s newly weighted air.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the idea that beauty can be complicit in pain is crystallized in the rainbow cast by grief-laden glass. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of heavier air reconfigures value silently. Subtext operates through sensory contradiction—cold quartz vs. warm grief, bright rainbow vs. shadow sorrow. The truthful-lie motif is organic, not a prompt echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual grammar: “the shifted hush,” “faint hum,” “language of frost.” Syntax lengthens under meditative pressure, then fractures into shorter beats when grief hits. No filter-verb clutter; “she realized” is the single necessary tell. Voice never drifts into editorial; even the arbor’s “heavier air” is sensed through her skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned—light, frost, breath—so density feels earned. No mixed metaphors; quartz, mist, and rainbow keep physical logic intact. Only micro-loop: “the prism… the object… the prism” within 30 words (−0.2). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with her inhalations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar mystic-empath trope is refreshed by frost-map methodology and the notion of “truthful lies” in cut glass. The prism-as-grief-vessel is not new, yet the specific linkage to winter storm pattern-reading gives it idiosyncratic spin. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but internal coherence and sensory specificity lift it above template. Transformation test passes: swap quartz arbor for generic grove and the frost lens collapses.</comment>
