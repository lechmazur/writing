<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “gently systematic” trait is shown through wire-wrapping action, but interiority drifts into generic stewardship language (“bridge between worlds”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the six-month death sentence is accepted with identical serenity, flattening stakes. The final diary entry voices theme instead of revealing a last, costly micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each copper-wrapped branch adds visual density and pattern recognition that culminates in the glowing pillars. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias’s earned stasis beneath the oak—where the reconfigured orchard is left as gift, cost legible in “not mine to keep.” Orientation is clean; stakes tighten once when copper reveals hollow carved pillars, foreclosing pure horticulture and forcing architectural guardianship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper-wrapped oak arches are vividly particularized, constrain Elias’s movements, and mirror the closing labyrinth image. Sensory detail is selective (visual haptics of wire hum) rather than encyclopedic. The pillars’ interior carvings supply micro-setting that charges the final image when they “glow,” meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—leaving a living legacy before death—is signaled early but remains abstract; no visible resource (time, strength, wire) is lost or depleted on-page. Tightening occurs only once: discovery of hollow pillars shifts task from garden tending to civilization revival, yet no further trade-off is dramatized. Cost is felt conceptually at closure but never materialized in a beat that forecloses an option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges through living architecture rather than sermon, but the diary’s final articulated wish (“remind them of the respect we owe”) edges into explicit moralizing, damping resonance. The orchard-as-temple is a fresh synthesis, yet the civilization backstory stays schematic, limiting thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady, with perceptual signature in wire tension and arboreal mimicry. Prose rhythm modulates between calm long sentences and shorter observation bursts, mirroring methodical caretaker temperament. No dialogue, so voice remains interior; occasional elevated phrasing (“brazen calm”) is consistent with Elias’s self-conception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lean scaffolding; information density high—“copper wire, once wrapped around oak branches to guide their growth, now served as a reminder” triple-functions as tool, history, and map. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; final paragraph repetition of “orchard whispered” is purposeful cadence, not artifact. Occasional filter (“seemed to hum”) is voice-motivated, not clustered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Living stone pillars + copper-wired arbor-architecture offers fresh mythic botanic engineering, but the “diary holds civilization secrets” trope is familiar. Specificity of wire-guided oak arches rescues premise from abstraction; transformation would collapse without these exact botanical-mechanical details. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than spectacle—but not bold enough to earn bonus.</comment>
