<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guardian’s silence is used as an active instrument: shutter-weaving and mirror-tilt reframe the stranger’s self-perception without a spoken word, embodying the “teach darkness stars” motive. Interiority is minimal yet consistent—stillness as practiced discipline, not vacancy. The stranger’s change is credibly sourced in these micro-interventions, not therapy-speak. Cost is present: the guardian’s labor leaves them alone again, a cyclical service that forecloses personal connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: shutter patterns and mirror glints layer until the stranger’s reflection literally re-weights self-image—Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (the guardian’s perpetual solitude). Causality is lyric rather than plot-based, taught early and held. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the completed constellation of shutters coincides with the stranger’s final exhale, narrowing possibility from despair to release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock planks, rain-slick and mirroring night sky, double as physical stage and metaphoric threshold; the dental mirror micro-setting literally reframes the setting inside the stranger’s eye. Weather and surface condition guide footing, pace, and risk of slipping—quiet tactile constraints. Guardian’s body is barely sketched yet present in “stepped back,” “tilted mirror,” enough to track spatially. Final image of stars in mirror fuses setting and interior state, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the stranger relinquish the half-spoken secret. Escalation is textural: each shutter adjustment tightens ambient symbolism until mirror-reflection forces confrontation. No external antagonist; pressure is situational—stillness vs. disclosure. Cost is the stranger’s vulnerability and the guardian’s absorbed sorrow; guardian’s endurance forecloses reciprocal comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern-language: shutters = artificial constellations, mirror = self-as-starfield. No explicit moral; final image re-prices “darkness” from void to sky-holding. Subtext operates in silence and reflective glints; implication > declaration. Complexity preserved: guardian remains anonymous, stranger’s future uncertain, teaching is cyclical service not victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate drifts closer to guardian without slipping into head-hop; perceptual signature is selective attention to reflected light and creaking wood. Syntax is calm, spiraling, long sentences that breathe with the slow reveal. No dialogue beyond stranger’s whispered question—voice remains unobtrusive instrument rather than spoken exchange. Compression in “spiralingly calm” is earned by repetition of spiral motifs; diction stays within guardian’s quiet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for guardian’s stillness, shorter fragments when stranger speaks. Figurative language is spare—only “pebbles into a stream” simile—avoiding purple clutter. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Final paragraph’s mirror-star linkage is crisp, no mixed metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope—mystical helper at waterside—transformed via non-verbal craft: shutter-weaving as constellation-building, dental mirror as therapeutic lens. Risk taken in refusing spoken resolution; payoff is quiet yet legible. Integration feels inevitable because mirror and shutters seed early and return charged. Specificity of cobalt dock, rain sheen, and dental tool keeps it from generic anywhere.</comment>
