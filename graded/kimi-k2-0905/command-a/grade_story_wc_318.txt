<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Eli’s mournful eagerness is embodied in every pull of the cord and cracked note; the leaf-blower-as-conductor conceit stays particular to him, not generic. Internal contradiction is present—he knows the task impossible yet keeps pulling—but the “household” he wants to heal never materializes on-stage, so the emotional cost is projected outward rather than enfleshed. Still, his micro-choices (warming handle, fluid steps, final release) track a credible arc of exhaustion-to-hope. The flaw is off-page stakes; the strength is embodied, non-label interiority under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tunnel exhales warm laughter, proving the symphony reweighted silence itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gust layers density until cadence shifts at the crescendo. Orientation is taught early (“echo chamber tunnel stretched endlessly”) and anchors hold. Cost is legible in the cool handle and Eli’s heaving chest; no因果 leaps break the chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its walls modulate sound, amplify off-key wind, and finally warm the echoes—environment directly constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Eli notices handle warmth, vibration, dust motes—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: center-stage pull cord, swirling fragments, exit step. Micro-setting (handle) doubles as charged object, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each escalating gust that macerates stillness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tunnel’s echo warms, foreclosing the option to quit before laughter returns. Agency is cumulative/textural: Eli’s endurance, not a single decision, pays the price. Cost is felt in cracked voice and warm handle; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of noise into comfort: mechanical whine becomes lullaby, silence becomes disease. No character articulates the thesis; the final warm exhale reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—handle warmth = emotional investment, off-key wind = flawed love. The laugh-tentative, plural—avoids tidy triumph, leaving plausible ambiguity about how far the healing reaches.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Eli’s perceptual filter: “worn smooth…felt alive,” “jagged, imperfect,” mirror his cracked interior. Syntax stretches and compresses with breath-like cadence; no drumbeat patterns. Diction stays within plausibly Eli’s—no academic register intrudes. Patterned repetition (“mourfully eager,” “off-key wind”) is taught early and pays off in final charged image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled—mechanical whine blending with lullaby is intentional, not self-contradictory. No loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif of breath/wind. One minor over-modifier cluster (“strange harmony that felt both broken and whole”) but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The leaf-blower-as-conductor trope is fresh, fully committed, and inseparable from plot mechanics—without it the entire symphony collapses. Tunnel-as-echo-chamber reverses expected silence-into-terror into silence-into-healing, a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk—the off-key lullaby—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of handle warmth and cracked voice prevents generic substitution; transformation test fails if any element is swapped.</comment>
