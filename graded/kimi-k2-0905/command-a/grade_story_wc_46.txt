<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to give light while fearing fire—remains embodied in the tactile ritual of polishing; the moment she lifts the glowing glass, we see the earned cost of that vow on her scarred hands. Yet the “pearl of stillness” functions more as lyrical label than crucible: no alternate path is ever risked, so the final stance feels like confirmation rather than renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the grotto’s moonlit glass becomes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her childhood rule—light without fire—into a portable gift she can now carry to the village. The single shard of memory (mother’s line about cracks) is anchored to present polishing strokes, satisfying BRR; causality is purely Accumulative/Textural, but the final image crystallizes options with felt cost, so lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Serpentine walls and luminous moss are never tourist scenery; they channel moonlight onto the glass, literally supplying the final beam that reconfigures the stake. Mist functions as both cocoon and amplifier, constraining visibility so the glass’s first glow becomes the only available light source, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver starlight without fire—tightens once: the glass must achieve mirror-brightness or her vow collapses. Pressure is textural rather than causal (density of polish, color intensifying), but the final beam forecloses the option to retreat back to fire, and the price (years of scarred trial) is recalled on-page, satisfying cost legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the cracked-to-luminous trajectory: brokenness as hidden reflector of cosmic light. Subtext stays in gesture—fingers tracing edges, breath syncing with strokes—avoiding overt thesis; final moonlit sliver offers resonant reconfiguration rather than moral, though the mother’s proverb comes close to an echo (-0.3).</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering every detail through Lira’s synesthetic bias (salt-scent = childhood cliff, glass weight = memory mass). Rhythmic control peaks in the polishing sequence—short clauses mimic circular strokes—without syntactic monotony; perceptual signature is consistent and paid off in the final image of cloak-mist following her upslope.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer sentences during memory, staccato polish-strokes during work. One scaffold “the glass… the glass…” repetition is minor; no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Information density strong—each sentence layers weight, color, breath—but occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “zephyr bloom”) nudges register slightly above Lira’s experiential lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar wounded-craftswoman arc is refreshed by astral-light-without-fire constraint and gem-polish mechanics specific to sea-glass micro-structure. Grotto-as-optical-device is a fresh inflection that fuses setting and theme. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding stock fire-spurning tropes.</comment>
