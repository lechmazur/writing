<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically embodied—“coat patched with stories,” “pockets lined with verses”—and his dreamer-persona choice to paint poems on the library wall is a costly micro-act that forecloses vagrancy. The monthly molting trait is announced but never allowed to complicate present action or risk, so it stays ornamental. Clara’s quiet-steel voice is distinct, yet her grandfather’s letters function as external prompt rather than crucible; she doesn’t face a forced choice under pressure. Closure earns its charge because Elias’s renunciation of endless shedding is legible in the final rooftop beat, but the cost is more conceptual than corporeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts this self and pins his hope to the library walls, a visible forfeiture of perpetual escape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each poem painted adds density until the “glow” reweights the stake. Causality is loose (letters, tin, friendship arrive without trigger) but coherence is achieved through pattern: every fragment literally sticks to the walls. Cost is felt in the final image—“the library glowed”—a conceptual repricing that makes anarchy bearable art.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is kept tactile: creaking gate, sagging shelves, rooftop scar-map view. Selective sensory economy—dust smell, dented tin, moonlit paint—mirrors the patched-coat aesthetic. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. For 9+ the setting would need to actively constrain a final choice; instead it serves as canvas rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty-from-anarchy—signals early and tightens through each poem-painted beat; the library’s growing glow literalizes the abstraction. Escalation is textural: density of verses on walls replaces rising causal threat. A visible price (Elias abandons perpetual reinvention) appears only in the final paragraph; earlier stakes feel conceptual rather than visceral. Sufficient for 8-band but lacks a mid-scene foreclosure that would punch higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patched coats, dented tins, painted walls—repair as art—without any thesis statement. The luminous-fracture motif recurs meaningfully: light pours through cracks in both city and people. Final rooftop image answers the thematic question non-literally: patching is rebuilding. Avoids sentimentality; complexity remains in the ongoing decay outside the library walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent poetic register—“map of scars,” “forgotten hymn”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature is biased toward the visual and tactile, apt for a poet who paints. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Clara’s diction is plainer, creating clean contrast when she speaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence layers image or emotional charge. Figurative language is patterned (“blooming resistance,” “luminous fracture”) and repaid at closure. One paraphrase loop—“library glowed with a newfound vitality” echoes prior “glow”—but too minor to penalize. Line breaks breathe with emotional cadence; no scaffold clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The vagrant-poet who literally molts personas monthly is fresh, yet the war-letters-inside-tin reveal is familiar. Synthesis—poems as literal patches on walls—feels inevitable and specific. Risk is moderate; premise could tip into allegory but stays anchored in sensory detail. Would benefit from one more surprise that only the molting rule could enable.</comment>
