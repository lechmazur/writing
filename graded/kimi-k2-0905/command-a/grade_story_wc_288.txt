<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is atmospheric but leans on abstract labels (“brittle determination,” “sense that she was meant for more”) rather than embodied contradiction. The core shift—from scholar to embodied conduit—arrives as visionary download rather than a micro-choice she actively hazards under pressure; cost is declared, not dramatized. Her lineage and solitude are vivid, yet the orb-hand beat summarizes transformation instead of staging a charged, resistible decision. Voice remains consistent and particular, enough to satisfy the 9- gate for character-driven lyric mode.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal-Accumulative hybrid: every beat is a because-therefore linkage (“sundial opens door therefore orb accesses lineage”) that tightens knowledge and narrows option space. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elena’s body becomes the library’s tuning fork, costing her unbounded solitude—felt cost in the final image (“light pulsating in sync with her heartbeat”). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) established within 50 words; no teleporting props or logic leaks. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length; the orb transfer is irreversible and legible.</comment>

<comment>Tidal library above clouds is more than postcard: its shifting shelves physically redirect Elena’s path, forcing her to decode hum-directions—choice-constraining environment. Brass sundial serves as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its atomic reflection aligning with carvings to unlock door—specific tactile interaction. Sensory triage favors scent of parchment and metallic tang, both filtered through scholar’s priorities. Setting charges the final image: shelves rearrange to acknowledge orb-merged Elena, proving the environment registers her new state. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms or impossible geography.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signaled early and tested once: orb meld irrevocably ends solitude, converting her into co-habited vessel. Tightening occurs at door-unlock: failure risk (hum could reject her) is implied but not dramatized on-page; escalation is more knowledge-deepening than option-narrowing. Cost is conceptual—loss of autonomous self—but acknowledged only in final sentence. Sufficient for 600-word bandwidth, yet lacks visible tactical price mid-sequence; keeps score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of coexistence emerges through image of shared heartbeat; no explicit thesis stated, avoiding moralizing. “Brittle awakenings” motif starts abstract but gains substance when orb-light echoes earlier “brittle light,” reweighting isolation as porous inter-dependence. Subtext resides in bodily fusion rather than declaration. Could reach higher if earlier beats foreshadowed symbiosis cost more concretely; as is, resonance is present but slightly airy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains steady perceptual signature—Elena filters world through relic scholarship, noticing etchings, hum frequencies, twin-sun reflections. Sentence rhythm swells then compresses during orb-contact, mirroring sensory flood. No dialogue, so voice coherence rides on diction control: avoidances of cliché, Latinate clutter, and template cadence throughout. Filter verbs are minimal and justified; no head-hop or register drift. Distinctive enough to meet 9- gate minus the hairline abstraction in peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected. Figurative language sparse and precise (“clouds swirled like a restless sea”)—single metaphor, cleanly handled. Information density high: each sentence advances setting, motive, or mythos without padding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line crystallizes image with cadence shift. Clean grammar, varied paragraph lengths, no tense drift. Minor alliteration is pattern-taught and pays off orally.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.5</question>
<comment>Floating tidal-library-as-memory-codex remixes familiar tropes (Sky-library, living archive) but grounds them in stone-circle acoustics and atomic brass tech, yielding fresh texture. Synthesis feels inevitable post-orb fusion. Risk taken with visionary over event-driven climax, yet coherence holds. No close-quoted famous scenes; concept commits fully without retreat. Slight deduction for abstract “hum” mechanic that could feel generically mystic, though saved by material detail of brass alignment.</comment>
