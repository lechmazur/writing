<comment>Elara’s “brightly attentive” trait earns its keep: it surfaces in micro-choices (spotting the 7-multiples, decoding the song, lying to her boss) and feeds the final, costly decision to risk exposure. Interiority stays concrete—headset-adjust, eye-scan rhythms—never slipping into diagnostic labels. The only soft spot is the climactic leap from “coordinates” to “they were taken,” a cognitive jump that feels slightly under-cued by prior choices, trimming the top band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: patch discovery → number pattern → song sync → Limbo folder → lie → offline hack → Mara audio → coordinate revelation → decision to expose. Each because/therefore tightens options until archive lockout forces the lie and offline gambit. Closure lands on-page: she steps out with memorized coordinates and the patch, a visible forfeiture of safety. The orientation anchor arrives inside 120 words (headset, archive, cold case), so no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The social-network archive is more than wallpaper: its forgotten corners, metadata, and security lockouts directly constrain her moves and supply the Limbo folder. Sensory selection skews visual-digital—timestamps, IDs, headset HUD—mirroring her technician gaze. The frayed patch provides tactile counter-texture and re-appears in the exit image, passing the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Could have used one auditory or thermal detail to widen the bandwidth, hence shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Echo-7—signals early and escalates through archive lockout, lie, and personal risk. The meaningful tightening is the system purge that denies access, forcing her to lie and go offline; this narrows options and raises visible cost. Stakes stay coherent; coincidence is absent. The price (job security, possibly career) is legible but could be sharper if we felt one concrete consequence (security badge revoked, supervisor email) before she walks out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—“absence leaves a pattern the living must decode”—emerges through recurrence of numbers, song echo, and archive voids, never sermonized. The final image of Elara carrying the patch into the corridor reweights the opening “sensed absence” as active responsibility. Subtext in Dr. Mara’s clipped transmission carries the cosmic dread without exposition. No tidy moral, only the charge of an unanswered plea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, tech-adjacent, faintly noir: “digital expanse,” “metadata,” “frayed fabric”—all suit a corporate archivist. Rhythm tightens under pressure: short clauses mirror lockout urgency; longer sentences return during song analysis. No head-hopping, psychic distance steady. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“Access denied. Data purged.”) and carries subtext of corporate cover-up. Slight cadence repetition in “she realized… she decided…” but not enough to dull propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose stays lean: every sentence advances discovery or texture; no filler, no loops. Figurative control tight—metaphors are spare (“void left by the missing crew”) and don’t clot under pressure. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; final line offers resonant callback. One micro-register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for the POV, but it’s brief and isolated, so −0.2, still within high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “deleted-file afterlife” hook is fresh, and linking it to a deep-space abduction via numerological breadcrumbs feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Corporate-archive setting tech is specific rather than generic cyberspace. Song-rhythm encryption is a clever subversion of usual hacker tropes. Risk is taken—entire conflict is desk-bound—yet tension never flags, proving quiet stakes can carry. Only the patch-as-talisman leans familiar, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>
