<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s spatial gift is asserted but never exercised; the “physics of letting go” is told twice yet never dramatized as an internal contradiction. The offered mushroom is accepted without visible cost or prior micro-choice, so the final stance feels gifted rather than earned. Interiority drifts into thematic label-speak (“she understood something her father had tried to teach her”) at the exact beat where embodied conflict is required.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing—the mushroom reweights “boundaries are bridges”—but the lack of any prior tactical use of permeability means the cost is conceptual only, not felt. Causality is loose: footprints appear, figure declaims, gift accepted; no because/therefore linkage tightens options. Orientation is clean by 120 words; however, the mid-scene arrival of the stranger dissolves pressure rather than escalating it, so the lens slips from situational to declarative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Farm is evocatively lit and anchored early; the glowing mushrooms constrain visibility and supply the final charged object. Spatial choreography stays legible as Elara tracks footprints; no impossible positions. Yet the setting never actively obstructs or enables her choices—she could reach the same clearing in daylight—so environment informs mood more than tactics, capping entry to 8-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unauthorized entry—deflates once the intruder proves benevolent; tension shifts to abstract theme without new external risk. No meaningful tightening: options do not narrow, no tool or stamina is lost, no legal or social cost surfaces. Agency is receptive (accept mushroom) rather than decisive, so escalation is affective, not causal, under the situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries is coherent but announced openly by the stranger and Elara’s father; subtext yields to thesis. Mushroom recurrence supplies a reprise yet never changes meaning before the final offer, so resonance is mild. Ending avoids moralizing, yet the insight feels imported rather than wrested from experience, keeping the score mid-tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature leans on light/dark imagery without drifting into generic fantasy voice. Syntax stays controlled, with rhythmic variation that modulates with the glow’s intensity. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior diction occasionally elevates toward the declarative (“revolutionize the way she saw the world”) but remains within plausible late-night reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and vivid, with strong verb choices (“pulsed softly,” “cutting through the bioluminescent haze”). No looped phrasing or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor over-writing in descriptive stacking (“sprawling labyrinth of glowing fungi, pulsed softly, casting an ethereal light”) but momentum recovers quickly. Closure line avoids cadence monotony and ends on an active image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent mushroom farm as security perimeter is fresh; “familiar strangers” and “physics of letting go” avoid cliché yet feel slightly prompt-derivative. Synthesis is specific to this setting and stakes, not easily transplantable. Risk is moderate—lyric encounter rather than action—but coherence stays high, earning upper-mid originality.</comment>
