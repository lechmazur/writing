<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s grief-tinged duty is sketched with tactile micro-choices (hand brushing pouch, steadying voice) that embody her mentor’s creed. The interior contradiction—obey mission control vs honor dead mentor—activates only late; prior beats are largely observational, so the renunciation feels more declared than dramatized. Still, the final clench of the sand grain gives a visible, scaled cost that satisfies the 600-word threshold.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is lean: chemical message → decode → stay to dawn → final shot. Orientation is clear by line 5; no spatial drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she forecloses retreat, sand grain in fist, sunrise on metal—cost is imaged, not exposited. The beat would sharpen if the chemical trigger altered her tactics mid-documentation rather than merely confirming what she already wants.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Regolith crunch, visor fog, drone hover, and low-g choreography are woven through action, not catalogued. Summit slope, module contour, and shifting light angles track cleanly and constrain camera placement and departure timing. The sand grain serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minus: lunar night chemistry that reveals text at sunrise is asserted without prior world-rule seeding, slightly denting credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve historical trace vs corporate erasure—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the timed message forces her to risk being stranded. That single escalation is sufficient for length, but the jeopardy is more moral than physical; the on-page price is the photograph itself and the symbolic sand-grain squeeze—felt, yet not acute enough for 8+ bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence vs stewardship emerges through the hourglass relic, footprints, and sunrise erasure without sermon. The final image reweights prior material: the grain—once a memento—becomes covenant. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers whether one photo can truly “outlast the dawn.” No thematic echo penalties apply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s professional perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under melancholy, shortens during discovery—voice modulates with pressure. Lexicon remains within lunar-inspector register; no corporate drift. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pause”) is minor and does not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary openings and length. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer (“shadows danced,” “universe whispered”) is restrained and patterned early, so it reads as voice rather than decoration. One mixed vehicle—“dawning hush” literalized as both time and emotional mood—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Apollo-site preservation timed to imminent terraforming is a fresh lunar angle; the hourglass grain as covenant object is specific and memorable. Tropes (lone inspector, mentor’s ghost) are personalized through chemical-message mechanic and sunrise deadline. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution competent but not boundary-shattering.</comment>
