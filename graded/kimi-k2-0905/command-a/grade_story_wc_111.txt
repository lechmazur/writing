<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured through gnarled-hand work, patient ritual, and the marble-cupping gesture; his pragmatic streak silently overrides futility with each deliberate polish. The contradiction between “withered” body and precise motion embodies conflict without label-speak. A single sustained POV keeps interior access consistent; the final renunciation—he places the last marble, accepting imperfection—carries visible cost. Micro-choices (polish, place, pause) are legible and scale to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: marbles accrue symbolic weight via daily ritual; cadence shift lands in the charged poise of the final gleam at sunset with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words: Elias, garden maze, present afternoon. Closure reweights premise: cracks become beauty’s source; no outline sequencing. One transition (weeks pass) is legible and taught by ritual repetition. Cost is visible—he forecloses the fantasy of perfect restoration and accepts perpetual mending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze, weathered hands, cracked marbles, and shifting light act as micro-settings that constrain motion and focus attention; the maze literally funnels Elias to center for final poise. Selective sensory layering—tactile vine grit, glass glow, dusk chill—mirrors internal stance without catalogue. Spatial choreography holds: marbles travel from vine pocket → workbench → maze heart. Atmosphere evolves from stubborn labor to luminous acceptance, charging the resonant final image. Tool/object integration passes 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove self-worth to garden via visible repair ritual; secondary—fear of futility. Escalation is textural: each marble placed heightens ambient color/aliveness, tightening Elias’s perceived reciprocity. No external antagonist; pressure is existential and cumulative. Final placement crystallizes stance, foreclosing perfectionism with on-page conceptual cost—he concedes partnership, not conquest. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mended deception emerges through concrete ritual rather than thesis: cracks reframed as radiance. Theme refrains from moralizing; final whisper of leaves offers charged poise, not lesson. Motif (marbles) reweights at closure without late symbolism dump. Complexity preserved: beauty and decay coexist; no tidy redemption. Emotional aftereffect lingers as bittersweet acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, close third aligns with patient vine-dresser perception: synesthetic glow, seasonal patience, tactile precision. Rhythm slows to ritual cadence; compressed diction under pressure (“he polished, placed, breathed”) mirrors method. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Diction stays rooted in horticultural lexicon; elevated metaphors (“fragment of the garden’s soul”) are brief and patterned early. Perceptual signature holds throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with deliberate paragraph breaths; sentences vary length to mimic pruning pauses. Figurative control disciplined—only two sustained metaphors, both taught early and paid off. Zero filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Information dense: one sentence often sets scene + emotional tilt. Minor nominalization “collection” repeats; not severe enough to dull closure image. Final line (“garden…gratitude”) lands clean and concise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantified luck as off-stage world rule, but story focuses on manual, anti-metric patience; marbles as micro-monuments to repaired imperfection. Conceptual risk of “blooming withering” tone pays off in final image—reader feels simultaneous gain/loss. Not a template plot; garden trope inverted—gardener is pruned by garden’s recognition. Specific horticultural actions avoid generic nature writing. Transformation test fails with synonym swap, suggesting room for more idiosyncratic detail, hence no 9+.</comment>
