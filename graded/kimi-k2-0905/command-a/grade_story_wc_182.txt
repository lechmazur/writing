<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly asserted but only shown once (bypassing traps); interiority is generic (“her mind already racing”) and emotions are labeled, not embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; the final bargain is clever but won too easily, so cost is intellectual, not felt. Kael is pure plot furniture—zero status friction or micro-choices—so relationship crucible bullet is N/A. Competence swamps struggle; no flaw complicates the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: diary → chrono-blossom → doorway → bargain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s linguistic trade re-weights access to reality-altering knowledge. Cost is present but abstract (“balance of time”)—not viscerally felt—so barely passes 9+ cost proof. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by word 50; no penalty. One shard, single POV, defaults met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore is vivid (“shelves shifting imperceptibly,” “books that snapped like jaws”) and constrains movement, supplying traps and resources. Garden’s temporal glow feeds the final image. Selective sensory triangulation (moss-leather spines, ticking petals) keeps economy. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. Environment mirrors internal state (labyrinth = puzzle mindset) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library access—signaled early. Escalation is situational: labyrinth resists, traps narrow options; chrono-blossom pick is one visible tightening with on-page cost (garden shifts, doorway appears). Stakes remain abstract (“reshape reality”) without concrete loss or forfeiture. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates. No secondary stake or moral calculus, so depth plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge vs. equilibrium emerges through bargain, not statement. Final image (mountain’s whispered approval) offers quiet resonance—library lessons as “symphony” re-weights earlier auditory motif. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (will balance hold?). No recurring image shifts meaning; chrono-blossom is prop, not motif.Insight is intellectual rather than gut-punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains consistent perceptual filter (linguist notices “script only she could read”). Syntax is controlled, lightly Latinate without register drift. No dialogue to judge; free indirect style clean. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“air hummed with whispers”) are purposeful, patterned early. Voice modulates slightly under pressure (shorter clauses during trap sequence). No head-hopping or lens slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; few scaffolding loops. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal energy,” “conceptual repricing”) fits linguist POV. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop: “shifting corridors” / “shifting walls” within 40 words −0.2. Peak beat (plucking blossom) is crisp, uncluttered. Copy clean; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Living mountain bookstore” is fresh fold of two familiar tropes; chrono-blossom time-key is clever but under-exploited. Guardian-bargain twist avoids fight scene, yet terms feel generic (“balance of time”). Transformation test: swap botanist for cartographer and story still works—library quest dominates. Risk is moderate; no structural innovation. Specificity of moss-script and clock-petals keeps it from template drift.</comment>
