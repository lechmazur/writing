<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is sketched as “lonely visionary” but interiority drifts into generic cosmic awe (“gleamed with determination,” “heart pounding”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows him risking anything tangible until the final activation; prior “tireless deciphering” is summarized. The variant-allegiance fork is declared externally by radio voice, not wrestled with via visible dilemma or sensory cost. Closure earns a stoic smile, yet the price (sanity, relationships) is asserted, not dramatized on this page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: radio signal → portico activation → visionary transformation. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; storm & altitude anchor hold. Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—symbols etched, dawn reframed—visible cost is the portico’s fracture and Elias’s tacit exile in new light. However escalation is单一的：中间段落用“weeks of deciphering”滑过，radio beats未产生递进选项，压力峰值仅靠命令句“Unfold it”推动，因此不具9+的持久约束力度。</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Observatory is vivid—cobalt portico shimmer, antenna jury-rig, storm-lit peak—details filter through Elias’s tuner-vision. Weather and altitude remain present, narrowing to his hand on cool glass at climax. Mountain geography is stable; no spatial contradictions. Environment constrains final image: the portico’s etched symbols and parted clouds refract the new dawn, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape a new dawn”—is declared early; pressure escalates only once when voice orders “Unfold it.” Prior tension is atmospheric (storm, visions) rather than option-narrowing; protagonist does not sacrifice or forfeit anything on page until final activate-and-smile. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Lacks a mid-story tightening that forecloses a live path, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical destruction/renewal emerges through portico and storm imagery; no explicit moralizing. The “ancient shadows / new dawn” dichotomy is returned in etched symbols and unfamiliar sunrise, giving non-literal reweighting. Ambiguity remains—will humanity thrive?—without forced profundity. Could be sharper if earlier beats linked personal loss to cosmic wager.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains rhythmic, slightly elevated diction fitting obsessive seer. Sensory selectivity (radio static, glass hum, lightning glare) stays in Elias’s perceptual register; no filter-verb glut. No dialogue, so voice carries full load without contamination. Minor template cadence (“He saw… He saw…”) in vision paragraph dulls propulsion but does not corrupt closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Most sentences advance image or knowledge; density is high. Metaphors are coherent (portico as bridge, storm as birth). Paraphrase loops minimal—only mild echo of “new dawn.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. A few elevated phrases (“lyrically prophetic,” “gritty whimsy”) feel prompt-sourced but don’t muddle causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Crystal-portal & mystic-radio tropes are familiar; freshness lies in storm-peak observatory as birthing chamber and the visionary’s quiet smile at an unreadable sunrise. Synthesis not yet inevitable—swap portico for orb, little else changes. Risk level moderate; structure stays safe-linear. Specific detail (cobalt glass shards, etched symbols) helps, but core combo remains recognizable New-Age apocalypse.</comment>
