<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her pulse-linked sundial, the ache in her chest while reading the captain’s confession—yet the “architecture of lies” motive stays abstract; we never see one specific lie she means to dismantle. The salvaging micro-choices are present and legible, but the final uplift feels slightly under-costed: she stands “tall,” journal in hand, without an on-page forfeiture or newly closed path. Voice remains coherent and individual; the contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs. fear of what it costs) are hinted but not crystallized in a single pressured moment. Still, the embodied emotion and tool-attention lift this above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sundial reconfigures its markings, Elara physically possesses the journal, and the canal’s “alive with possibility” serves as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—she now carries an accountable truth. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvage layer (debris, chest, journal, sundial glow) deepens pattern and reweights stake without relying on coincidence. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and never slips. One tightening beat—the chest opening—suffices to narrow options. Cost is present yet muted: no tangible loss beyond prior existential weight, keeping this just under the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Damp-earth air, star-mirror water, moss-erased barge names—environmental details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s legend-seeker gaze. The canal evolves from decay to “alive with possibility,” mirroring internal shift without emblematic overstatement. Micro-setting (the rotting barge hull) literally constrains her salvaging motion and supplies the chest; the sundial operates as charged tool-as-setting. No physics or idiom errors; spatial choreography is clean. Meets the 9-band gate by charging the final image, but lacks the razor-edge constraint that would push higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing hidden truth—signals early and tightens once: chest opening forces a go-forward with the journal. Agency is present; Elara’s salvaging decision drives the reversal. Cost is conceptual (burden of captain’s guilt and wider deceit) but not viscerally felt—no tool breakage, social risk, or time loss on page. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; canal decay and radio silence heighten ambient tension. Sufficient for this length, yet the absence of a palpable price keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of contested truth emerges organically from captain’s confession and sundial re-pricing; no final moralizing. Journal’s “revelation of a lie that cost him everything” reweights earlier legend-chasing without abstract statement. Subtextual silence of the morning radio subtly echoes societal complicity in erasure. The ending image invites reflection: personal clarity vs. societal decay. Complexity is honored; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid—“brass surface etched with intricate patterns that seemed to whisper secrets of time”—without filter-verb bloat. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for canal description, clipped clauses during salvage. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction remains within POV lexicon. Slight lyrical uniformity in sentence openers keeps this from 9.0, but texture is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often paints scent, light, and metaphor simultaneously—“surface a mirror reflecting the faint glow of the stars above.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; scaffold is minimal. Metaphors stay coherent (whispering brass, canal as past-present seam). Opening line anchors stakes; final line crystallizes recharged possibility. A few intensifiers (“seemed to whisper,” “faint hum”) could be trimmed, but none clutter closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sundial-as-truth-key and derelict canal salvage refresh familiar relic-hunt tropes through sensory specificity and accumulative texture. The “architecture of lies” angle offers fresh moral geometry: personal complicity in collective forgetting. Risk is present but moderate—quiet lyric escalation rather than dramatic twist—yet coherence stays intact. Transformation test passes: Elara’s specific gaze and canal decay are inseparable from premise. Not wildly audacious, but particularized enough to feel memorable.</comment>
