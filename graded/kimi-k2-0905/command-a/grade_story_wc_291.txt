<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s face-blindness and methodical temperament are vividly dramatized—her grip on the lancing tool, the deliberate charcoal strokes—yet the quarry encounter remains a single, low-interaction beat; the figure’s anonymity is accepted too easily, muting visible flaw-driven error and cost. Interior contradiction is strong (“shield” of blindness vs need to see), but the moment of potential mistake (misreading the silhouette) is skipped, so the final stance feels more confirmed than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry portrait crystallizes Elara’s stance—“bridged the gap, one stroke at a time”—with felt conceptual cost (she leaves with only an image, no hard evidence). Causal chain is lean but intact: ribbon clue → silhouette confrontation → artistic re-visioning; the missing police file motivates but never becomes a loophole. Orientation is clean by line 5; the mosaic of mist, ribbon, and tool tightens rather than fragments the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist, gravel breath, and charcoal dust are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered; the quarry’s jagged edges literally guide her retreat and later soften under her drawing, satisfying the 9+ constraint that environment constrains choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots crunch, distance to silhouette measured by heartbeat—while sensory hierarchy narrows to pallid light and frayed silk under stress. No occupational overload, yet the smith-forged lance inherits credible weight.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy for Lila via art—is signaled early; the tightening beat is the silhouette offering a matching ribbon, forcing Elara to test her method against live menace. Cost is present (solitude, archival erasure, possible stalker) but remains conceptual rather than visceral; the price is “lighter heart,” not irreversible loss, keeping the entry just shy of 8.8. Agency is inventive: she forecloses pursuit in favor of portraiture, a credible artist’s renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-vision emerges through recurring ribbon threads and the final charcoal beam, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the raised ribbon is both invitation and threat, read only through Elara’s synesthetic intuition. The portrait’s softening of stone into light offers a resonant non-literal answer, resisting moral summary; ambiguity lingers—has she connected or merely comforted herself?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, painterly, with rhythmic alternation of long breathy sentences and hammered fragments (“She stepped back…crunching on gravel”). Perceptual signature—pattern recognition without faces—remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but cadenced to her silence, sustaining psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“Her breath visible…chill air”) and one metaphor mix (“clockwork mechanism” vs later organic thread) nudge downward. Density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work—while opening/final lines frame the beam-in-mist image with echoing precision. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving cold cases via art is a fresh synthesis; the quarry becomes both canvas and chasm, the ribbon a tangible synaptic bridge. Risk lies in renouncing pursuit for aesthetics, a stance that could feel evasive yet is justified by her established methodical empathy. Specificity of smith-forged lance and charcoal-over-mist technique prevents template drift; transformation test passes—swap elements and the whole crumbles.</comment>
