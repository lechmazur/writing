<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “idealism” stays thematic; only one micro-choice—planting the sapling—shows risk, and it’s swallowed by summary. Her dusky-steady voice is vivid, but interiority leans on abstract labels (“weight of it all”) instead of body. The Earned Stasis lands because she repeats the choice aloud, yet the causal path that proves she could leave is never sketched, so the cost feels asserted not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “I’ll stay” reweights every seed and carving with permanent self-exile. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—root patterns, tokens, and wall stories layer until the doppelgänger crystallizes the debt. Orientation is met inside 120 words; the single off-page jump (“years ago”) is legitimately ellided. Cost is felt in the final breath, satisfying the 9+ cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop—root-etched tarot pattern physically blocks her shovel, turning geography into antagonist. Half-lit glow tracks psychic descent; light refusal mirrors her refusal to exit. Sensory triage (earth/decay/roots) stays selective and POV-filtered. The burned card functions as micro-setting that charges closure when held up like a shield, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend souls vs. reclaim own freedom—signals early and tightens once: the root-pattern warning forces her to confront the bill. Agency is present but soft; she declares endurance rather than tests an alternative path. Cost is conceptual (eternal binding) rather than tactile; at this length that suffices under Accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inversion: meaning-making as currency spent recklessly, paid not with object but with life-term. Subtext lives in gesture—roots locking like shackles—avoiding thesis statement until the final whisper. The refusal to moralize (“destinies aren’t meant to be bartered after all”) lands as Conceptual Repricing. Minor echo of “patch holes in the soul” edges toward prompt-speak but is embedded early enough to avoid penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; diction stays within Elara’s lyrical-reverent register. Syntax flexes—long breathless clauses for orchard sprawl, abrupt fragments under confrontation. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor rooted in body (“voice … blackened”). Dialogue is minimal but voice-internal, so naturalism not tested. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads root tangles as tarot warning; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer job-double duty (action + atmosphere). Overwriting threatens in first third—three consecutive “roots/snaked/veins” metaphors—but pattern teaches orchard-as-body and pays off in root-pattern confrontation. No loops or scaffold; minor tautology “bones like ancient veins” could trim. Final line cadence lands cleanly, no artifact interference at closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard tarot economy feels fresh synthesis of necropolis + arbor + cartomancy, not stock image. Bartered destiny framed as artisanal labor (carving stories, planting seeds) flips usual Faustian deal. Doppelgänger test doubles the moral calculus without moralizing. Risk is structural—lyric accretion instead of event cascade—but coherence holds, earning the high-band adjustment.</comment>
