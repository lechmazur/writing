<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrical and consistent, his astonishment quietly embodied in how he studies light and wind. Yet his contradictory impulses—yearning to retreat vs. rising guardianship—are stated more than dramatized; we never feel him physically wrestle with the decision to sing. The final endurance is credible, but the cost is atmospheric rather than viscerally personal. Voice stays individual, no safety-hedging, though micro-choices under pressure could cut deeper.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a luminous Earned Stasis: the ghosts dissolve, the oasis stirs, Elias’s guardian identity crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each fragment he gathers (symbol, melody, water) layers density until the final song releases the covenant’s weight. Orientation anchors within 120 words, no lens ambiguity. The stained-glass box reappears in the last line, charging the image with prior pattern—meets 9+ test for Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>The skeletal greenhouse, cracked cottage, and hidden well are tactile, lived-in, and directly enable the ritual beats. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but stays selective; wind and temperature guide attention under drought urgency. Micro-setting (box as cooling shade) constrains Elias’s pacing and ultimately carries the final image. Environment could tighten one more non-visual sense at climax to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the covenant to free the ghosts—surfaces early. Pressure deepens through accumulative discoveries rather than narrowing options; the only decisive turn is the final song, so escalation is textual, not reversible. Cost is felt as atmospheric weight, visible on the page when lights dissolve into leaf-rustle. Sufficient tightening for 600-word lyric arc, though a mid-story micro-reversal could have sharpened 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme of giving voice to silence emerges through ritual action, never sermons. The shifting meaning of “unspoken” (ghosts → land → Elias himself) is reweighted in the final image without tidy moral. Subtext resides in gesture—Elias cradling the box like a hymnal—rather than assertion. Quiet ending satisfies the 9+ quick test, but a hair more ambiguity could push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s astonished perception, syntax elongating like drought light, then compressing at song climax. No head-hopping, diction within recluse lexicon, perceptual signature intact. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. A riskier rhythmic fracture at ritual peak could have earned 9-, but current control is confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor apparent. Sentence rhythm modulates from languid observation to staccato ritual cadence. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (ghosts as flickers) sustained without clutter. High information density; every sentence advances image or mythic logic—approaching 9.0 clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Post-apiculturist wasteland guardian is fresh, but covenant-with-ghosts is familiar folklore dressed in drought glass. Specificity of beekeeping ruins and stained-glass reliquary lifts the concept above template. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not startlingly unforeseen. Sufficient risk for length, but lacks a radical formal or moral twist to breach 8.8.</comment>
