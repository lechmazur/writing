<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s guilt and her need to quiet the firmware are cleanly dramatized through the act of writing letters-as-child; the micro-choice to forge those replies is concrete, costly, and irreversible. Interiority stays embodied (“hands no longer steady but free”) rather than diagnostic. The contradiction between self-punishing isolation and the therapeutic outreach she denies herself is present but could be sharpened earlier; still, the final renunciation carries visible cost and is earned by prior causal beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: guilt → firmware amplification → letter discovery → forged replies → silence. The discovery-of-letters beat is a clear decisive turn that narrows options; the final meteor hush is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the laboratory…”) so the Orientation Test is waived. No causal gaps; every beat either raises the psychic volume or offers the one path Elara can bear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Laboratory, amber, and tattoo gun are rendered through sensory selectivity (“golden glow a stark contrast to the metallic sheen”) and constrain the final choice: the amber’s glow foreshadows the eventual stillness, the tattoos are the medium of penance. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; no white-room syndrome. The “folding time” rule is taught early and stays consistent. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the internal shift, so 9-band not quite reached.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s guilt-roar—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when letters force confrontation. Escalation is psychological: each forged reply increases the risk of self-exposure while reducing the internal din. Cost is legible: the final silence arrives with emptied hands and a new fragility (“hands no longer steady”). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and culminates in Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—redemption through listening rather than silencing—emerges from the image sequence: trapped insect → trapped self → released insect/self. No overt thesis statement; the final “meteor hush” reweights all prior machine hums. Subtext is carried in gesture (sealing the last letter) rather than declaration. The ambiguity of whether the firmware is truly quiet or merely drowned by newfound quietude adds productive resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains stable psychic distance and a tactile, slightly fevered register (“laboratory of lost sounds,” “folding of time”). Syntax modulates: longer cadences for dread, short clauses at the hush. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly Elara-bound. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction stays within plausible range for a tattooist who reads stars.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly clean: strong verbs, no paraphrase loops, punctuation correct. A few soft modifiers (“tirelessly,” “relentless”) could be trimmed; one mixed metaphor (“constellation tattooist… hush the dissonance”) is minor. Rhythm breathes with scene pace. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final sentence lands with imagistic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-gothic firmware with constellation tattooing is fresh; the baby-cry mistranslation misdeed is a sharp, non-obvious catalyst. The amber insect as objective correlative for frozen guilt is not new, but its linkage to the final stillness feels inevitable here. Risk—lyric.accumulative rather than linear plot—pays off because closure is legible. Conceptual integrity holds: magic-tech rules stay internally consistent.</comment>
