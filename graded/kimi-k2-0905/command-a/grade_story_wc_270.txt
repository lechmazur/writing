<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s insurgent-grandmother identity is stated, but we see only one micro-choice—pressing the embryo to the kite. The rest is summary of her history and intent. Interiority is generic (“her mind humming,” “heart lighter”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the decisive act is not preceded by visible stakes or a competing impulse, the change feels declared, not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: kite-script → decode → embryo-touch → unsealing-light. Orientation is clear by 80 words; closure is a Decisive Change charged by the glowing cracked embryo and the plants’ hush. Cost is present yet thin—no forfeiture or persistent constraint is shown on-page. The lens holds, but the price is more implied than felt, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Steam, bubbling, and amber-gold light are filtered through Mara’s urgency; the springs function as rebirth crucible rather than postcard. Spatial choreography stays clean across the guard confrontation. The kite-tail script gains micro-setting status by guiding the final act, satisfying the 9+ gate. Some sensory phrasing drifts toward template (“light like molten lava”), keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore culture via embryo—signals early. One meaningful tightening: guard blocks path, then steps aside, but the reversal is external and frictionless. Escalation is primarily atmospheric (steam, light) rather than option-narrowing; no credible loss alters tactics. Closure lands with visible spectacle yet minimal personal cost, meeting the word-scale threshold but not the 8.8 charge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Theme of “tradition must evolve” emerges through embryo and plant chorus, avoiding explicit moral. The kite-script reprise at the end reweights the motif effectively. Subtext is light—guard’s hesitation could carry regime fragility but is undeveloped. Final sentence is a touch explanatory, trimming top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara with perceptual signature (“plants whispering,” “fabric brittle”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during unsealing. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice sustains texture. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant light”) momentarily drifts from Mara’s idiom, holding below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Prose is largely clean, high-density; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop: “rebirth…rebirth” concept echoed in adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphor risk: “steam rose like ghosts…molten lava” in same breath. No artifact touches closure; rhythm supports ascent. Tightening the echoed noun and aligning heat imagery would lift to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Insurgent-grandmother telepathically seed-talking via volcanic kite-code feels genuinely fresh. The synthesis of plant-sentience with cultural-restoration embryo is specific, not grafted. Risk is present but modest; still, the combination and grounded hot-spring crucible make the piece memorable and non-interchangeable.</comment>
