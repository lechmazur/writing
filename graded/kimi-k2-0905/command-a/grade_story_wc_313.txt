<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet resolve and “precisely humane” vocation ground every step; his decision to stage the exhibit is a visible micro-choice that costs him solitude. Interiority stays concrete—boots sinking, glass cool against palm—never drifting into label-speak. The flaw: no contradictory impulse is shown in scene; he moves from guardian to curator without friction or self-doubt on the page, so the change feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the framed label in the town hall crystallizes a new communal stance toward memory, cost paid in Elias’s overnight labor and the town’s exposed grief. Causal linkage holds—each photograph found tightens his obligation until the exhibit becomes inevitable. One soft spot: the “trail of photographs” appears as a fait accompli rather than a choice-triggered discovery, blunting the final tightening beat by a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The reservoir’s mirror-surface and star-pricked ridgeway are sensuously anchored, filtering through Elias’s warden gaze—he notices damp earth, crickets, label edges. Micro-setting works: the sapphire label’s texture alters his grip and later the town’s gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment never actively constrains choices, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere braids tightly with emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—town’s amnesia versus reclamation—is signaled early and tightens when each photograph forces Elias closer to public exposure. One meaningful reversal: private night vigil becomes communal daylight reckoning, cost paid in his vulnerability to crowd emotion. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-turn, fitting Accumulative lens; pressure stays legible. A sharper price—say, an elder’s anger or official pushback—would have pushed the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as living water that must be deliberately released, not dammed. The liqueur label’s reprise—first found, then framed—reweights “L’Oubliée” from quaint relic to civic covenant, achieving resonance without moralizing. No late thematic echo line; image carries the idea. Subtext in the silent wind chime and mirrored hush invites the reader to feel omission as presence, lingering after the last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature: “precisely humane,” “glassy surface,” “pinholes in a dark cloth”—diction calibrated to a watchman’s measured gaze. Rhythm pulses: long twilight sentences contract into staccato morning beats when townspeople gather, mirroring emotional crescendo. No dialogue to test voice separation, yet narration never slips into committee-speak. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, varied: “boots sank slightly,” “stars beginning to prick,” strong verbs over modifiers. One paraphrase loop—“the town began to resurface, not just physically but emotionally”—costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or artifact clusters; closure image remains crisp. High density achieved: each sentence layers action, sensory cue, and emotional tilt without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “forgotten town reclaimed by curator” premise is refreshed through liqueur label and photograph trail—concrete, specific, non-obvious vectors of memory. Risk is moderate: quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic flood-rescue, but coherence holds. Transformation test passes; Elias’s warden identity is inseparable from reservoir geography. Could edge higher with a sharper twist—say, discovering the label maker still living in exile—but current synthesis feels earned, not borrowed.</comment>
