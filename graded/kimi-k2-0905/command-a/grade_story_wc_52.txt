<comment>Elara’s grief-driven motive is vivid; her carving micro-choices (tracing, pausing, sipping) embody contradictory impulses without resorting to therapy-speak. The final renunciation—accepting impermanence by finishing the lion—carries visible cost, but the interiority drifts into thematic echo (“here and gone” restatement) near the close, muting the full sting of earned contradiction.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass of the chisel thickens emotional density until the finished lion crystallizes a before/after stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reweighted by the carved object itself, with felt cost in the tapering rain. A micro ambiguity: the “here and gone” refrain is stated more than dramatized in the final beat, a hairline slip that keeps it just shy of 9-territory.</comment>

<comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank are handled tactilely; the loft’s drip rhythm and steam light actively narrow Elara’s attention, constraining her timing (“while the kettle boils”). Micro-setting succeeds, but wider geography (city, season) is absent—acceptable at this length. No environment details distort closure, so no cap applied.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—convert grief into artifact—tightens once: the lion’s mane complexity forces a tactile trade-off between perfect recall and accepting imperfection. The cost is legible in her bleeding fingertips and the kettle’s waning whistle, but escalation is single-tier; no secondary pressure tests her resolve. Sufficient for this compressed frame, but a second constraint would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through concrete particulars—wood grain, evaporating steam, tapering rain—not authorial commentary. The final image (closed-eye lion) offers a non-literal answer: surrender to transience is the only containment. Avoids overt moralizing; the one “here and gone” echo in last paragraph grazes thematic-statement territory but does not break resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“rust-hued peace,” “rain-beaded”) is specific yet consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses during reflection, clipped fragments during carving. No dialogue to test voice distinction; no POV slippage. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits outside her lexis, but isolated.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—steam “distorting” light works—kept below saturation threshold. One strained metaphor: “time itself had crystallized” edges toward abstraction, but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so artifact penalty minor. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Widow-wood-grief is familiar, yet synthesis feels specific: lion tamer’s ethos refracted through carving a sleeping lion whose closed eyes reject spectacle. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric instead of circus drama—but coherence justifies the choice. No close echoes of famous scenes; premise not radically transformed, hence mid-7 band.</comment>
