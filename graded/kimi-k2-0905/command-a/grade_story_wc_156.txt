<comment>Elara’s interiority remains vivid and embodied—her fingers “trace,” she “hums,” she “conducts”—but the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity is told more than dramatized; the moment she “nodded” is summary, not a micro-choice we witness under pressure, so the cost feels soft rather than carved on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mural’s awakening and the coin-figure’s step-out create a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her prior certainty. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore; the garden’s hum and her harmonic response accumulate until the final image crystallizes meaning. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate disorientation (shifting mural, talking coin) pays off in the charged final image. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the “cage” of certainty is named, yet we do not feel its bars snap, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies awaken the mural, metallic flowers supply the hum that she conducts, the etched nickel vibrates in her palm—each constrains her tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no floating white-room moments. Micro-setting (coin, wall, her body as antenna) functions as extension of garden, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened when the obsidian-eyed woman demands the trade. One meaningful deepening: the mural’s figures step out only after Elara cedes control, foreclosing her old method. Cost is conceptual (loss of former self-concept) rather than tactile; a visible forfeiture (tool dropped, coin spent) would have sharpened the price.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: restoration is reciprocal, not unilateral. Final image—garden as tapestry of stories—reweights earlier “restoring what is lost” into “being restored by the lost.” No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Ambiguity lingers: is she now caretaker or captive? Complexity embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—colors “explode,” lines “hum,” coin “winks.” No head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: long lyrical sentences swell during harmonic convergence, then snap to short declaratives at “You have done it.” Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within artistic lexicon. Voice remains singular, not committee.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense; metaphor strings serve the garden’s synesthesia without overcrowding. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated cadence (“nested awakenings,” “bewitch the soul”) edges toward thesaurus-lite but stays motivated by the lyric concept. Closing image earns its flourish; no artifact touches the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—a mural that awakens via sound-coin resonance—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Hobo nickel as animist key, garden as tuned instrument, restorer as antenna: synthesis is specific, not modular. Risk taken: lyric causality over plot mechanics, and it pays off. Could not swap garden for generic forest; acoustic magic is baked into every beat.</comment>
