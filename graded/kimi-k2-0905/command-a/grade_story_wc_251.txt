<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “hear unspoken words” gift is asserted, never dramatized with cost or contradiction; interiority drifts into abstraction (“forests of second thoughts”) without embodied stakes. The chess-coach identity is ornamental—no chess detail informs tactics or metaphor. Motivation stays static; no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. Closure is a scenic wide shot, not a paid-for renunciation, so change feels un-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—town pausing before glowing windows—visible cost is the coach’s solitary vigil, but causality is thin: grotto inspiration → organize displays is summarized, not shown in linked beats. Orientation holds; library/grotto spatial logic stays coherent. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “amplified quiet” and cadence tightens at final hush. Still, the decisive tightening beat (displays going live) is off-stage, blunting because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt library and mist are anchored early; magnetic grotto returns twice, starlight charging the final image. Sensory triad (sight/sound/breath) is selective, filtered through Elias’s hush-obsessed attention. Micro-setting—chessboard abandoned mid-game—mirrors internal stall, constraining choice. Environment never actively obstructs or resource-strips, so stakes remain atmospheric rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is declared, but on-page pressure is limited to townspeople pausing; no credible loss or forfeiture alters Elias’s tactics. Escalation is a single summarized intensification: displays glow, people stop. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence is absent, yet agency is observational, not interventionist. Cost is aesthetic (lonely watcher) not practical, keeping tension in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance to haste emerges through recurring “hush” and window tableaux rather than thesis statements. Subtext resides in unplayed chess pieces and unheard whispers—nice indirection. Final image reweights prior motifs but stops short of conceptual repricing; ambiguity feels purposeful yet not electric. Avoids moralizing, but lacks a jagged after-image to linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—cobalt, mist, star-whispers—syntax lengthens and softens to mimic hush. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Free-indirect bursts (“as if the very walls were holding their breath”) risk lyric overkill but remain consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments absent—appropriate to single-minded mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“amplified quiet” repeated with small variation) but not scaffold-heavy. Metaphors stay coherent—grotto as cradle—no mixed vehicles. Information density dips in mid-paragraph backstory capsule; could compress “he had always been attuned…” block. No artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence breathes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fusion of chess-coach + unspoken-words + window-tableau rebellion is fresh, yet chess layer remains superficial—missed opportunity for strategic imagery or checkmate metaphor. Grotto-under-library is evocative, not radically new. Risk level moderate: quiet insurrection via shop-window art is gentle rather than bold, but specificity of “synchronized displays” gives local flavor. Transformation test: swap coach to poet, story still functions—indicating partial freshness.</comment>
