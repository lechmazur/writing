<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is serviceable—she acts, touches, decides—but emotions stay at label level (“felt a shift within herself”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the garage-sale plan is clever yet executed in montage, so we see no micro-choice that costs her. The urn fragment warms her once, then becomes a map; the emotional stake of holding eternity in her palm is asserted, not embodied. Closure is mild stasis rather than earned renunciation; the chronometer stabilizes and she “feels belonging,” but no prior flaw or obsession is visibly paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: broken capsule → fragment → Thaddeus → weaver → fix. One meaningful tightening occurs when the urn fragment guides them to the hidden chamber, narrowing options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with faint conceptual cost—time regains rhythm and Elara gains purpose—yet the cost is reported (“she felt”) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity; structure is default single-scene with accumulative texture, pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emerald silo, weathered metal, whispering pines give quick, efficient anchoring. The body-as-setting appears when Elara touches the fragment and the silo hums through her, a tactile micro-setting that constrains her next move. Garage-sale montage is sketched, not choreographed; spatial clarity weakens amid the crowd. Final image of the urn on her desk re-uses the object as micro-setting, but the chamber description is generic “ancient artifacts,” lacking sensory specificity that would charge the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time itself slipping—is signaled early via flickering chronometer. Escalation is single-thread: fragment → hidden chamber → temporal weaver activation; each step forecloses retreat. Agency sits with Elara (she devises the garage-sale trap, activates the weaver), but price is conceptual rather than visceral—no personal loss is shown. The tightening is coherent under causal lens yet remains intellectual; tension never becomes bodily or social.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of temporal weaving emerges through object and action rather than sermon, but the concept stays abstract—“texture of time passing” is named by Thaddeus, not dramatized. The urn’s return on the desk offers modest resonance, yet its pattern does not evolve in meaning. Final image gestures toward quiet acceptance rather than re-pricing any belief. Subtext is thin; silence and gesture are not mined for irony or tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays stable inside Elara; no head-hop. Narrative diction is neutral-fantasy (“borrowed-time timekeeper,” “temporal weaving”) with mild syntactic variety; rhythm does not compress under stress. Dialogue from Thaddeus is expository, not subtextual, and converges toward Elara’s diction. Perceptual signature is limited—she notices gears and patterns but not in a way that individuates her beyond job label.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse; “whispering pines” is stock, but no metaphor storm clogs the climax. Sentences advance; paragraph cut test passed. A few filler tags (“it seemed”) dilute immediacy but do not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm is adequate, not musical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusing time-keeper myth with garage-sale cryptography feels fresh; the temporal-weaver device is a familiar trope but acceptably re-contextualized. Eldermere and emerald silo are crisp micro-details. The urn fragment’s reprise supplies a small inevitable echo. Risk level is moderate; the concept doesn’t retreat, yet it doesn’t push into stranger territory either.</comment>
