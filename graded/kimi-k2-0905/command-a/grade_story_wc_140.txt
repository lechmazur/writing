<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The wanderer’s “nameless” identity and death-certificate glitch are evocative labels, but interiority stays abstract: we never see a contradictory impulse acted out in real time. Emotion is summarized (“their heart quickened”) rather than embodied through sensory or behavioral tells. The final stance—guardian of the forgotten—is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly forecloses an alternate path. The concept is strong, yet the character remains a silhouette rather than a pressured individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged fragment adds density until the archive container reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”the texture of memories was… the act of remembering”—but the cost is more asserted than felt; no prior option is visibly closed off. Tides and label appear early, satisfying orientation; causality between items is associative rather than consequential. One meaningful tightening occurs, yet the escalation is poetic accretion, not narrowing choice.</comment>

<comment>Port-container maze is vividly evoked through rust, crane-hum, salt air; spatial choreography stays consistent as the wanderer moves. Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV—sound of lullabies on wind, feel of frayed labels—though tactile interaction with containers is brief. Tide rhythm supplies live environmental pressure, revealed objects (mudflat watch, letter) integrate with action. Setting never constrains a final tactical choice, so capped below 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased histories—signaled early; pressure grows through each discovered fragment. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the archive discovery deepens thematic weight but does not force a decision or risk. Agency is cumulative attention rather than a crucible choice; cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Escalation is steady texture, not tightened constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges via salvaged objects rather than exposition. The poison label’s reprise (“For the forgotten”) reweights the premise at closure, achieving CR. Subtext rests in silence of vanished people; no moral is stated. Complexity is present but slightly thinned by the wanderer’s overt concluding insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice remains stable, with salt-stained diction and rhythmic sentence variety. Perceptual signature—pattern-seeing, echo-hearing—filters every description. No dialogue to test, but narrative idiom stays consistent. Filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy (“they realized then”) yet pattern holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm modulates with tidal cadence. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only atmospheric work. No scaffolding, but occasional abstract nouns (“existence a glitch,” “texture of memories”) substitute for concrete image. Closure line is crisp, earning its lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Death-certificate survivor navigating a secret container-archive is fresh; accumulative mosaic structure suits erased-history theme without feeling gimmicked. Poison-label motif returns with reweighted meaning, fulfilling the transformation test. Risk is present but safe; could push further into tactile consequences. Specificity of port relics keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
