<comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are shown in concrete micro-choices—hesitating at the narrow passage, steadying herself with the compass—so her final embrace of “mutiny” feels earned. The father-loss motive is efficiently cued and transmuted into the compass-whisper without overt backstory dump. Interiority stays embodied, never drifts into therapeutic self-labeling. The only limit: secondary pressures (father, city, relic myth) stay off-stage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; still, the single-POV contradiction pulses under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: compass quiver → needle locks upward → hidden passage → shard → chamber contraction/expansion. The “lonely church organ” motif is seeded early as ambient legend and paid off as audible code that reweights the shard, satisfying closure with conceptual cost (she now carries the mutiny map inside her). Orientation anchors who/where by word 60, well under the 120-word trigger. One soft spot: the spatial-mutiny rule is asserted more than demonstrated until the final dilation; still, the because-therefore spine stays intact.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting dominance: the compass needle, stone arch symbols, and contracting chamber walls function as the immediate environment that constrains every move. Sensory triage matches panic—air “thick,” shoulders “brush” stone—then widens to aurora glow once threat flips to wonder. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body positions. For 9+ gate, the chamber reconfiguration directly charges the final image, but the city-scale geography remains impressionistic; hence 8.0, not 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key, survive confinement—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when walls begin to close. The reversal (contracting chamber) is physically manifest and forces her to “embrace mutiny,” paying a visible cost (claustrophobic panic vs. expanded space). Agency sits squarely on her shoulder: she chooses to push through the narrow throat and later to accept the spatial rewrite. Cost is legible; still, the mutiny concept stays slightly abstract, keeping the score just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fear reshaped into agency” emerges through the chamber’s literal expansion rather than exposition. The organ-code and compass-map recur and re-price meaning at closure without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: her trembling fingers on the arch symbols mirror the quivering needle—both are deciphering tools. Final image of compass pointing starside crystallizes a Charged Poise that invites reflection on freedom-through-mutiny, avoiding tidy thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains a lyrical, night-lit register—whisper, reverberation, shard-glow—without purple drift. Syntax compresses under stress (“She squeezed… shoulders brushing”) then elongates during wonder, mirroring emotional respiration. Perceptual signature is sharp: Elara notices distance by breath-scent and stone temperature, never tourist catalog. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the lone POV stays modest (no organ-exposition dump) and reliably interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean: varied sentence openings, no template cadence, high information density (“compass needle quivering as if alive” does two jobs: animate object + foreshadow). Minor scaffold: “the nexus was a place of paradoxes—vast yet suffocating” states what the scene already shows; a −0.2 loop. Metaphors stay coherent (needle/organ both vibrate through stone). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final-line star-point uplifts rhythm without forced uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “spatial mutiny” hook offers fresh leverage on classic lost-relic quest; the idea that rebellion can be against physics itself is non-obvious. Execution grounds abstraction in tactile body-horror of shrinking walls, preventing concept-stunt feel. Compass-as-map and organ-as-code feel particular to this piece, not looted tropes. Risk is moderate—lyric accretive structure, not twist—but coherence stays high; hence mid-7 rather than 8-band reserved for bolder formal gambits.</comment>
