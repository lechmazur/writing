<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is palpable in early image work, but her “strategically creative” trait is asserted, not dramatized; the pivot from passive mourning to active reel-hunt is announced rather than shown through micro-choice. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“steely longing”) that short-circuits contradiction under pressure. The earned shift—playing a “new song”—lands as symbol without prior tactical ingenuity visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the ticking clock and still compasses reweight meaning with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—reel appears on first mention, projector works instantly, film world spits her back without obstacle—yet the final image crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices at this length, but the reel’s deus-ex delivery keeps the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Tidal arbor above the clouds” is sketched with selective sensory strokes; floating islands and flickering compasses create texture without catalog. The piano bench, broken clock, and projector function as micro-settings that constrain touch and memory. Final beam of sunlight on the keys charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara can renegotiate fate—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only narratively: “air carried a weight” rather than through tangible obstacles or forfeits. The reel journey risks nothing tangible; no option is foreclosed, no price paid until the symbolic clock restart. Sufficient for short-form, but scarcity of on-page cost caps the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaiming agency through art emerges via image, not sermon: music as refuge becomes music as forward motion. The clock’s restart and compasses’ stillness reconfigure grief into acceptance without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—is the encore for her or for fate?—yielding quiet resonance. No late thesis statement; one decorative “surprise fate” phrase avoided final-paragraph placement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction stays pianistic—“gnarled,” “weathered,” “bleeding fingers”—without purple drift. Rhythm swells and subsides with scene tempo; no scaffold loops. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. One filter-verb cluster (“she often wondered”) is minor; no 9-bar because no peak-stress syntactic compression is attempted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold (“she watched intently, searching”) barely registers. Clean grammar, precise tense, and vivid noun choice throughout. Closure line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Floating arboreal station, film-reel destiny splice, and pianist-seer merge into a fresh surrealist triad; tropes are transformed through tactile detail. Conceptual risk—stepping into celluloid memory—pays off in final image. Not radically novel, but specificity of piano-as-lens and clock-as-heart keeps it from template drift. No close echoes of iconic scenes.</comment>
