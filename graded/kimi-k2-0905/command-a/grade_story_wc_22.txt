<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but generic; “weight of centuries” and “spark of possibility” are label-level abstractions. One micro-choice—placing pods—never complicates under pressure; no contradiction or visible cost. Motivation stays static; renunciation is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft-edged Charged Poise: garden may spread, cost is only hoped-for. Causality is weak; birds’ “map” is ornamental, never tested or failed. No tightening narrows options; stakes declared but never challenged on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory triage favors scent and color; jetty’s decay vs. bloom is vivid, selective. “Narrow vastness” re-appears as charged micro-setting in final image. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden vs. battlefield—remains abstract; no live obstacle or resource limit appears. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; no option is foreclosed. Cost is postponed to an imagined future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-decay emerges through recurring bloom/decay imagery. Final line reweights “narrow vastness” with gentle irony. Avoids explicit moral, but insight stays at proverb level rather than earned paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains twilight cadence; diction stays within coachman’s mythic register. Elision of因果 links is deliberate but taught early. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no head-hop or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is steady; sentences vary in length and hinge. Occasional stacked metaphors (“twilight’s embrace”, “whisper that carried centuries”) risk purple tint but match tone. No loops or scaffold; clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-reef dead-language gardener-coachman is fresh synthesis; bird-call cartography is under-used. Risk taken in lyric stasis rather than plot turn, so modest bonus. Concept stays memorable despite low causal exploitation.</comment>
