<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “inadvertently profound” trait is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or visible cost; the sanctifying speech is the only micro-choice and it reads as rehearsed wisdom rather than pressured revelation. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“felt a difference”) instead of embodied contradiction, so the final stance feels assumed, not earned. No persistent flaw or price attaches to his new calling, keeping the arc thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the shard reweights perception and forecloses Elias’s former detachment, with a faint but legible conceptual cost (“the houses… whispering stories he was now ready to hear”). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each displaced object accrues meaning until the final hush crystallizes. However, the middle lacks a tightening beat that narrows options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so the cost feels diffuse rather than acute.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The bay’s dawn light and scattered detritus are filtered through Elias’s selective attention, supplying tactile anchors (rusted key, broken shell) that double as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; objects are picked up, arranged, and re-seen without drift. While the environment does not actively constrain choice, the final image of “houses whispering” is charged by the orris-root glow, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-to-image linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stake—uncovering why houses feel alive—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external or internal force blocks Elias, so pressure is ambient, not tactical. The only escalation is a cadence shift: objects glow after sanctification, reweighting perception. Without a narrowing choice or forfeiture, the tightening is lyrical, not consequential, keeping tension at moderate simmer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—displaced memory seeking voice—emerges through the shard’s hush and the photograph’s reawakened laughter, avoiding overt statement. The final image reconfigures Elias’s relation to the built world without moralizing. Yet the insight floats on atmosphere rather than painful particularity, so resonance is gentle, not haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush”) creates a distinctive lyrical cadence that matches the hushed-blaze tone. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated phrasing (“time seemed to pause”) edges toward template lyricism but remains consistent with the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sensory detail is selective. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent, though “streetlights daydream” and “hushed blaze” flirt with mixed registers; they do not obscure causality. Closure line breathes effectively, earning its pause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The “normality noticer” and “shard of hush” offer fresh conceptual angles; treating memory as displaced beach trash re-visions the ghost-story trope. Yet the plot arc is a straight accumulation without surprising reversals, so the synthesis feels inevitable rather than revelatory. Specificity of orris root and dawn bay keeps it from generic magical realism.</comment>
