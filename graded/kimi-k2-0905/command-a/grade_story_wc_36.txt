<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory micro-choices; the crystal-orb trauma is recounted rather than lived, so her risk-taking at the flute feels pre-announced. Interiority drifts into catalog adjectives (“her heart pounding,” “trembling hands”) that don’t sharpen under pressure. The final step into the new world is passive—music “guides her” rather than a conscious, costly decision—so no earned renunciation or visible flaw compounds. Competence outweighs struggle; the lens stays situational, yet stance crystallization is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the flute’s note dissolves the canyon into iridescent elsewhere, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Causality is loose—driftwood markers appear only at point-of-need and the orb backstory is summoned to motivate without on-page traction—yet the pattern is legibly accumulative/textural under the hush-to-shatter cadence. Orientation clears by ~100 words; the lens holds, but escalation is single-shot rather than tightening. The cost is felt imagistically, satisfying the 9− gate, yet the beat remains solitary so the score caps at low-7.</comment>

<comment>The canyon hush is atmospherically vivid, its “avalanchingly quiet” density teaching the accumulative pattern early; driftwood and alcove scale are micro-settings that constrain path. Thunder rumbles exteriorize pressure without ever breaking the POV-filtered silence, a nice sensory inversion. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment enters the final image as charged price—the colored sky replaces the canyon—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve flute to prevent new rupture—is signaled early and met; pressure tightens once when canyon silence thickens to “tangible” at lift. Agency is passive—music does the weaving—so cost is imagistic, not tactical; no option narrows. Escalation is single crest, sufficient for short form under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves, satisfying Situational guardrail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of learning-through-failure emerges from recalled orb shatter rather than tested dilemma here; the new world promises future insight, so resonance is prospective, not earned reconfiguration. Image of sky-tapestry reweights prior canyon palette, giving non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. Concept stays implicit; no thematic echoing line cheapens closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable, syntactically controlled, with nice sonic repeats (“echoed softly… avalanchingly quiet”). Perceptual signature is generic epic-fantasy rather than individuated; filter verbs minimal, but metaphors are stock (“sky seemed to crackle”). No dialogue; therefore voice distinction and dialogue tests N/A. Compression is purposeful; elisions teach the hush pattern; no artifacts intrude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary openings and length. Information density high—each line moves atmosphere or motive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; metaphors remain coherent. Occasional elevated register (“gilded reed flute,” “tapestry of colors”) fits mythic tone and stays consistent; closure image unmarred by muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar portal-device + guilt-driven quest, but canyon-hush inversion gives fresh sensory hook; “avalanchingly quiet” coins a crisp oxymoron. Driftwood-as-signposts notion feels organic to place. Flute-as-key is trope-recycled yet justified by keeper profession. Synthesis suffices for short form; not groundbreaking but avoids checklist ornament.</comment>
