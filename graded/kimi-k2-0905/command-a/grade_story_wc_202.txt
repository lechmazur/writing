<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—emotions are named (“promise,” “weight”) rather than embodied in gesture or physiology. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; she glides from beat to beat without micro-choices that cost her anything. The childhood lighthouse memory is recalled, not dramatized, so it tilts the present stance but doesn’t force a visible trade-off. Closure is a quiet lyric fade; the “anchor” is asserted, not tested, so the renunciation feels foreshadowed rather than paid for in blood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (market, painting, tower) layers density rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors who/where by word 70; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lens fragment’s glow extinguishes, reweighting the stake from search to stewardship; cost is conceptual (stories now live in her, responsibility perpetual). No teleporting props; map reveal is seeded by spiral symbol. One cap: the tower arrival is summarized not dramatized, softening the final tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rooftop market is sketched with copper/sage scent and rope choreography; spatial planes stay consistent as Lila descends. Lens fragment functions as micro-setting—its pulsing light literally illuminates the hidden doorway, constraining her next move. Weather and city spires are filtered through her lighthouse nostalgia, never tourist catalog. Final image of dawn on spires mirrors internal reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor slip: tower interior sketched in two lines, less tactile than market.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepened by each artifact found. Pressure is textural: density of murals, stories “thick in the air,” rather than narrowing options. No credible loss (time, money, danger) is dramatized; escalation is cumulative awe, not risk. Closure reweights meaning but not tactics; hence mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through recurring “anchor” imagery: lighthouse lens → map → murals, each reframing remembrance as active tether, not nostalgia. Subtext in the spiral-triangle symbol links worlds without exposition. Final image of market awakening while Lila carries silent stories offers resonant non-moral answer: history survives only in custodial quiet. No echo-line or overt thesis; avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lila’s perception; no head-hop. Syntax leans poetic (“air hummed with copper”) yet remains within her translator idiom. Perceptual signature is light-centric: everything noticed by how it catches or withholds illumination. No dialogue to judge; interior rhythms escalate in shorter clauses at tower entry, then exhale into longer cadence at dawn, mirroring emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Occasional stacked modifiers (“elusively tangible edge”) verge on purple but stay just inside voice. One paraphrase loop: “stories…forgotten…overlooked” restated three times in 60 words; −0.2. No typos or tense slips. High information density: each sentence layers scent, symbol, motion. Closure line (“ready for the next world, the next story”) is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Floating alchemist market + lighthouse shard + painting cipher splice fantasy with archival mystery; combination feels fresh yet inevitable. Spiral-triangle symbol repurposes generic occult trope into memory key. Risk: lyric summary over scene at tower could feel gimmicky, but textural design is taught early and holds. Transformation test fails only in replaceable city-spire backdrop; core triad is inseparable.</comment>
