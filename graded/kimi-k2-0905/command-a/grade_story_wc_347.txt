<question>1</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradictions (duty vs. hatred of isolation) are voiced early and embodied when she palms the nut; her sprint-into-alcove save shows genuine risk. Yet her “reluctant caretaker” angle is told more than tested—no on-page moment where she almost abandons the traveler or the orchard, so renunciation cost feels light.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: nut-impressions → map → rescue → bud breakthrough. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the bud is fragile, the birds still wheel, orchard still cursed—Earned Stasis achieved. Orientation within 120 words (who/where/when) lands cleanly; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Cliff-salt wind and mechanical-bird whir anchor early; the nut’s “offhandedly exact” lines give tactile specificity. Final bud emerging through poisoned soil reweights the setting into hopeful frailty—meets 9+ quick test. Sparse but selective; economy favors momentum over breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep stranger alive before frost—tightens when map is assembled; failure cost is mechanical-bird mauling. One meaningful turn: she elects to expose herself to birds rather than hide. Price legible: frost bite, heart pound, orchard still cursed—options narrowed, not reset.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Themes of caretaking vs. agency and graceless beauty emerge through image (rusted birds, smooth nut) rather than statement. No final-paragraph moralizing. Resonant reprise: nut’s precision vs. bud’s fragility reweights “graceless beauty” without naming it—quiet but effective.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is soil-under-fingernails tactile, not tourist-catalog. Rhythm modulates: long clause for orchard gloom, staccato for dash through labyrinth. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon (“gnarled,” “whispered”).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>High density—“jagged paths winding between stone pillars weathered by centuries of wind and salt” does three jobs in one breath. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor template cadence in “mechanical birds… mechanical eyes… mechanical gears” (−0.2); otherwise propulsive and clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-blueprint + nut-key + graceless-mechanical-birds synthesizes fresh myth that feels inevitable in hindsight. Details (nut leaves impressions without touch) are specific to this world. Risk: cursed-orchard trope, but transformed through caretaker-map mechanic rather than spell-casting. No close echoes.</comment>
