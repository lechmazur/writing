<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is shown through refusal of violence and reliance on compassion, but the interiority leans on label-speak (“her pacifist nature had once been seen as a weakness”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The single on-page decision—inserting Kwan Yin’s Tear into the core—alignes with motive, yet the cost is more metaphysical than felt; no tactile sacrifice or irreversible loss is dramatized. The emotional shift toward “ghostly resolve” is asserted, not performed, so the arc is visible but not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: because she performs shadow-work stitching, the portal opens; therefore she crosses. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—golden dimension mirrors her healed stance—priced by the ship’s recycled solitude continuing. Orientation is clear by word 60; the lens is Causal, held to the end. One soft spot: the “locked dimension” rule is declared, not dramatized, so the seal/unseal feels slightly convenient, keeping it under 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ship interior is sketched with salvage-metal texture and engine hum; the new world gets golden light and living soil, enough to distinguish moods. Micro-setting works: the tear-as-object functions as steering key, so it earns the 9+ gate for Q3. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Sensory palette is safe—visual dominant, faint hum—never constrains a tactical choice, so it stays solid rather than vivid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the dimension or humanity ends—is signaled early. Escalation is one-phase: stitching severs the seal, narrowing option from “locked” to “open.” The price is conceptual—she accepts custodianship of a ruined paradise—but no tangible resource (fuel, time, bodily safety) is lost on-page, so cost is legible but not visceral. Agency is hers; coincidence absent; sufficient for 7.5, not the 8.8 tier that demands a felt toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of compassionate reconstruction emerges through stitching-as-mending without explicit sermon. The golden ruins reprice the premise: salvation is not pristine but patched, aligning lived detail to idea. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the tear’s glow is image not assertion. Complexity allowed: ruins imply prior failures of compassion, resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual signature anchored in tool-belt weight and photo-shimmer memory. Syntax varies: long lyrical cadence for void, shorter clauses at portal threshold. No dialogue to test; interior diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. One micro drift: “otherworldly resonance” edges abstract, but pattern holds. Voice is coherent, not yet unforgettable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“gravity of sorrow”) recur but are coherent, not stacked. High density: each sentence advances image or motive. Minor scaffold: “faint, otherworldly resonance” is filler-adjective pairing; does not tangle causality. Closure line is clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of pacifist last-human with embroidery-as-portal-tech feels fresh; tear relic avoids standard MacGuffin by doubling as compassion meter. Ruined paradise subverts golden dimension trope. Risk is moderate—cosmic stakes via domestic stitch—executed cleanly. Not quite paradigm-shift level but memorable enough for upper 7s.</comment>
