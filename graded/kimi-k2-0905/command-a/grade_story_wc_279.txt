<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid, poetic, and consistent with her whimsical, socially-attuned persona; embodied emotion (“lilac unease in her chest”) and micro-choices (inserting flake, whispering question) show contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance—enduring the hush—earns its cost via prior grotto-story revelation, satisfying Earned Stasis. Flaws: chalk-artist skill never alters tactics; no secondary character to test status; competence slightly outweighs visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tile dissolves into sand, reweighting meaning rather than resolving plot, with felt conceptual cost (“lilac unease remained, but…a guide”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification via mandala, mist, hush. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) achieved within 60 words. Minor slack: flake’s rule-set never constrains later tactics; causality is thematic, not physical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, tiles, mandala-sand function as micro-setting that constrains perception and choice; flake-as-tool literally rewrites the pattern and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (coolness against skin, emergent hush) is filtered through Elara’s artistic bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Reaches 9-band gate: environment guides final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—find meaning in the unlearning—tightens when the mandala reveals the silenced people’s self-chosen hush, foreclosing easy answers. Escalation is pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual (she must carry the unease as guide). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, sufficient for 600-word frame. Could use a sharper tangible loss to enter 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence chosen to escape truth becomes hollow, yet meaning is not restored but re-created by witnessing that hush. Subtext operates through image (hand silhouette, dissolving flake) rather than assertion. Final image reweights premise—unease as guide—without moralizing. Resists binaries; ambiguity lingers. Avoids thematic echo penalty; no character spells out “meaning must be created.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-accumulative voice: rhythmic, painterly diction (“mist clung…like a reluctant lover”) consistent with artist POV. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“seemed to hum”). No dialogue, hence no convergence issue. Patterned repetition of “interjected,” “emergent hush” is taught early and paid off in closure. Psychic distance modulates with pressure. Micro-pressurised syntax under final beat. Minor: occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) but stays within poetic licence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High信息密度; most sentences perform double duty (atmosphere + interiority). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent within grotto logic. No adjacent paraphrase loops. Scaffold-free. One mixed metaphor (“reluctant lover” + “emergent hush”) but does not blunt closure. Proofing clean. Minor −0.2 for decorative alliteration in “lilac unease” used thrice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chalk artist + mandala + tile-as-key is fresh; “emergent hush” as collective self-silencing avoids zombie tropes. Transformation test passed—swap artist medium and the thematic machinery collapses. Risky lyric structure paid off by coherent closure. Slight proximity to “silence as monster” motif but subverted by making it chosen, not imposed. Could push further into 8.5+ with sharper socio-political specificity.</comment>
