<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid in the memory-flood, but the pivot from panic to serene discovery feels abrupt; no embodied contradiction plays out in-scene. “Lonesome splendor” is named repeatedly rather than shown through idiosyncratic reaction. The final stance shift is stated, not dramatized with a micro-choice that costs her anything visible. Oxygen stakes evaporate once visions start, undermining credibility of her stress response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—cave-in → vial → memories → exit—but the decisive change (she simply walks out) is elided; we never see the mechanism that re-opens the temple, so cost is asserted, not felt. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Lens holds as causal, yet the magical escape hatch is a late, un-telegraphed rule change. Closure image is pretty but does not reweight prior stakes because the life-or-death pressure has already been defused.</comment>

<comment>Deep-sea temple is atmospherically rich, lightless and pressurized; carvings, crystals, and “gathered hush” give sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography stays consistent as walls shift. Environment directly enables the memory-trip, satisfying 9+ gate. However, the oxygen timer—crucial to early specificity—is abandoned once visions begin, blunting environmental constraint at climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape before oxygen ends—is announced early, but pressure collapses once visions start; no live clock affects later tactics. Agency is passive: memories happen to her, then the temple happens to open. Tightening occurs only in the first third; after that, stakes evaporate. Cost is therefore conceptual rather than visceral, and not legible on-page at exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “harness the ephemeral” emerges organically through memory-crystals and the vial’s glow; no overt thesis statement. Final image of sharing secrets with the world offers quiet resonance, though it leans abstract. Subtextual tension between solitude and connection is hinted but not fully mined. Avoids moralizing, letting motif of fleeting beauty stay implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, with patterned, elevated diction (“lonesome splendor,” “ethereal glow”) that suits temple awe. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under pressure, longer lyrical sweeps during visions. No dialogue to test naturalism. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature leans marine-biologist—she notes carvings, symbols, crystals—yet voice occasionally drifts toward poetic omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with vivid image density; no scaffold loops or template cadence. Metaphors (“temple holding its breath”) are apt but slightly plentiful in crisis beats, nudging overwriting. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored. Occasional elevated register (“unsnarl,” “conceptual repricing” cognates) feels slightly above Maya’s likely idiom, but not disruptive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Undersea memory-temple is fresh, but plot beats—trapped archaeologist, magical object, visionary escape—are familiar. Crystallizing fleeting moments into physical gems is a nice inflection. Risk is moderate: lyric compression over causal grit. Synthesis feels personal, yet not radically unforeseeable; transformation test shows arc could transplant to another lost ruin with minor edits.</comment>
