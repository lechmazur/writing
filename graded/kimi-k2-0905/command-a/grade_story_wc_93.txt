<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s precognitive curse is dramatized through ritualized micro-choices (rock placement, dust scatter) rather than label-speak; his interiority stays anchored to bodily tension and auroral shimmer. Interior contradiction is light—he fears yet craves clarity—but choices visibly foreclose the option to keep the sequence unchanged, paying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Flaws complicate rather than decorate: the same sight that guides him erodes certainty, shown when the pattern re-forms at the end. The ending “smile” is a shade tidy, trimming the full emotional cost of living inside eternal pattern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A single causal spine—curse-vision → rock math → dust ignition—drives every beat; no teleporting props or knowledge. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world feels friction-less because Kael now senses the weave, a conceptual cost that re-prices normal effort. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from auroral color cadence to final pattern shift, each image tightening density rather than forcing external turns. Cost is palpable on-page: “the world felt different, as though friction itself had disappeared” makes the perceptual price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Tidal bluff” is handled as tool and hazard: Kael crouches, balances, scatters dust onto exact ledges; geography limits pace and placement. Aurora is not backdrop but spectral metronome—color shifts cue each escalation, climaxing in the kaleidoscope that re-patterns the rocks. Eels surface only where reflux and reflection allow, making waterline proximity a live constraint. Because environment dictates method and final image, the 9-band gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract—cosmic pattern vs. personal sanity—but the text makes them visceral by tying each auroral intensification to Kael’s rising heart rate and trembling hands. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last rock locks the sequence, eliminating the option to retreat; escalation is thus knowledge-density rather than external peril. Cost is visible: frictionless world re-orients his gait and future choices. The threat remains intellectual, so the visceral ceiling is mid-8s, cleanly hit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image relay: eels = mutable threads, rocks = fixed integers, dust = fossil light; the closing re-combination reweights their relation without moral statement. No thesis lines—only the final “pattern had shifted” lets the reader feel knowledge as both gift and cage. Ambiguity is productive: sacred patterns promise unity yet demand endless pursuit, a tension left unresolved. The emotional after-effect is quiet awe rather than explanation, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight in Kael’s diction—verbs like “slippery charges,” “jagged edges kissed”—auroral colors filtered through his herder-eye. No head-hopping; perceptual signature selects matte rocks against shimmering water, foregrounding matte/mathematics tension. Rhythm accelerates into short paratactic clauses during dust scatter, mirroring pulse without syntactic monotony. Minor “borrowed dawn” echo flirts with poetic template but is earned by auroral setup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries dual load: “colors shifting from pale green to deep violet” paints sky and signals approaching climax. Metaphors are coherent—aurora as fabric, eels as moving stitches—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each rock placement adds new numerical or color data. Final line “he would chase them until the tides run dry” provides cadence without overwriting, cleanly capping propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fortune-telling fisherman with aurora-powered arithmetic—a fresh synthesis that scales cosmology to bodily ritual. The mathematical rock sequence feels inevitable in hindsight yet unforeseen at opening, meeting the transformation test. Risk in compressed lyric voice pays off: pattern-overload as sensory beauty rather than info-dump. Only fractional deduction for recognizable “reluctant seer” archetype, even though re-tooled through eel choreography.</comment>
