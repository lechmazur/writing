<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrical and consistent; his “positively wistful” nature is shown through tactile ritual (humming into jars) rather than label. The final shard-to-ear gesture crystallizes a credible renunciation—he forfeits perfect capture for living resonance—yet the causality between jammed gears and internal shift is lightly sketched, muting the cost’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loft feels “emptier, yet fuller,” reweighting the premise that remembering is redemption. The music box’s autonomous spill is the decisive trigger; Elias’s dropped jar makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of capture, pattern breaks, cadence shift—without late convenience. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The loft’s cracked beams and sand-filtered light are filtered through Elias’s prizing attention; the music box serves as micro-setting that finally constrains choice when it refuses capture. Sensory selection favors sound over visual catalog, mirroring his vocation. The dunes outside evolve from burial site to launch horizon, charging the final image with forward motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias bottle memory without killing it—tightens when the box plays unprompted, forcing renunciation of perfect preservation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from hunter to listener. Cost is legible in the shattered jar and forfeited control. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: translation between generations requires relinquishing ownership of the past. The music box’s refusal acts as the thematic pivot—redemption lies in release, not capture. Final image of wind carrying whispers offers resonant non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext operates through gesture (pressing glass to ear) rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“penny poet,” “sweeten the silence”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, breathy sentences during capture, staccato shards when the box erupts. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Psychic distance compresses credibly under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop (“emptier, yet fuller”) is purposeful resonance, not artifact. Figurative language clusters only after the box plays, when heightened texture is earned. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) fits the poet narrator without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sound-capture-as-preservation is fresh, but the music-box automaton and sand-buried relic tilt toward familiar tropes. Specificity of Elias’s coat “patched with stories” and grandmother’s laughter in a buried jar rescues the concept from abstraction. Final renunciation feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk is moderate; reward is emotional clarity.</comment>
