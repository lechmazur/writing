<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s fear of enclosure is shown through tactile beats—tightened grip, ragged breath—but the interior contradiction never loops back to complicate her vault choice; the liminal vision of Voss supplies emotional payoff yet lands as external gift rather than wrested change. The final calm is asserted more than embodied, so the cost feels implied rather than viscerally paid. Still, her flaws steer every spatial decision, keeping her recognizably individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: mentor debt → return → fleck → phase jump → knowledge → acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she renounces full mastery of the invisible, paying with permanent ontological uncertainty, signaled by the codex’s dimming. The cost is legible, yet the vault→liminality shift is narrated more than dramatized, softening the decisive change beat. Compression is strategic, but the late rule of “phase transition” is asserted, not seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The facility breathes with tidal lungs, silt crusting every surface; the headlamp’s dying cone narrows perception to immediate bulkheads, turning architecture into active antagonist. Micro-setting is met: the fleck’s glow and the liminal cable-threads physically constrain Elena’s final stance. One orientation wobble—vault spatial layout is skipped—but water levels are tracked cleanly. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to her claustrophobic filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—retrieve codex to see the unseen—tightens when walls literally close and water rises, forcing a speed trade-off. Phase jump is the single meaningful turn that reweights the mission from recovery to acceptance of invisible limits. Cost is conceptual (she gives up control), visible on-page as fleck dims. Escalation is linear but coherent under causal lens; no secondary reversal is needed at this length.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of respectful unknowing emerges through image, not slogan: cables as ancient veins, fleck as warning lamp. Final reconfiguration—choosing to leave part of reality unmapped—avains mechanical summary and lands via the hush-of-waves image. No thematic echo penalties; the concept stays implicit. Some symbolic freight (tidal breath = her panic) edges close to overt but remains anchored in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter: headlamp cone, salt taste, narrowing tunnel. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under stress, syntax shortening. “Crashing hush” refrain risks ornament but is justified as tidal heartbeat. No dialogue to test, so voice distinctness rests on sensory selectivity, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is sonically tuned—silt, pulse, hush—without metaphor pile-up. One scaffold loop: “crashing hush” repeated four times; each use advances beat, so only −0.2. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high; every sentence advances goal or pressure. Final image is clean, no artifact intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines claustrophobia, medieval fleck, and eldritch cable horror into one compressed arc; synthesis feels inevitable rather than stitched. The invisible-tracking fleck is treated as warning, not gadget—an inversion of typical MacGuffin. Risk is taken in liminal dissolve, paid off by thematic reprice. Not radically new parts, but the recombination is specific and memorable.</comment>
