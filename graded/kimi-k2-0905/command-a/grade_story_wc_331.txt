<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “sanely eccentric” label is asserted, not embodied; her rearranging books is the only micro-choice, and it carries no visible cost or contradiction. The scarf warms but never forces a trade-off, so the final “guardian” stance feels bestowed rather than earned. Interiority stays generic (“heart pounding,” “surge of warmth”) and never fractures under pressure. For 700 words we need at least one irreversible, costly micro-decision; the piece gives none.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doorway seals behind her, the scarf is whole, and she accepts guardianship—cost is the loss of the analog realm she just saved. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each geometric rearrangement thickens atmosphere until reality folds. However, the Orientation Test docks −0.3: “scientific poetry library” and “odd-hour” are clear, but calendar-time and spatial anchors (where are the patrons standing?) remain vague past 120 words and the payoff at closure doesn’t retroactively justify that disorientation. One minor teleport: the scarf floats free without a prior beat showing it loosened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library’s scent-shift and shelf-bending supply real-time feedback that constrains her next stacking move, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage—ink → lavender, moonlight on emerald threads—mirrors her narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: spiral, fractal, Möbius strip are sequentially tracked. Could use one tactile detail of book weight or dust to ground the final fold, but the setting actively enables the hyperbolic trigger rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“protect the living story-realm”—is signaled early and deepens when she sees it fraying. Escalation is textural: each geometric pattern intensifies scent, light, and scarf vibration, reweighting the stake from curiosity to custodial duty. Yet the tightening is gentle; no concrete resource (time, stamina, social credit) is visibly forfeited, keeping cost legible but abstract. The final guardianship is acceptance, not sacrifice, so pressure plateaus just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: analog memory’s fragility versus digital erasure, embodied by the scarf’s regeneration. Subtext sits in the Möbius stack—children’s stories literally twist into one another—repricing the premise without exposition. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; the image of the restored scarf reweights earlier nostalgia into custodial responsibility. Ambiguity lingers: can she ever re-enter? The question is left alive, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: equations “hum,” moonlight “catches faded emerald,” reflecting her math-poet hybrid mind. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for stacking, staccato “library trembled” for fold-moment. No head-hopping; patrons remain silhouettes, preserving POV distance. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator meta-language, not in her lexicon, but it occurs outside narration; internal diction stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean: each sentence either advances stacking or registers sensory shift; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral mirrors scarf fringe—without mixed-vehicle clutter. One scaffold clause: “its shelves groaning under the weight of bound ideas” could trim to “shelves groaned under bound ideas,” but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. Final image (“library was more than a building…”) is tell-ish; a single physical beat of her locking the door would sharpen exit, yet the line is brief and doesn’t stall cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of hyperbolic geometry with narrative metaphysics feels fresh: the Möbius children’s strip literalizes infinite story loop. Scarf-as-analog-talisman repurposes a cliché into world-key. Risk is taken—math as spell-casting—yet rules are taught early and paid off. Not quite 9.0 because the guardian trope is familiar; still, the synthesis of math, nostalgia, and sentient library is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>
