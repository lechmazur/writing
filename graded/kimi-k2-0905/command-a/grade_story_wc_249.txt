<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character interiority is poetic but floats in generalized lyricism; “auroral sorrow,” “shared dream” are abstract labels that never concretize as contradictory impulses. Fingers-drum tic is the lone embodied beat, repeated to saturation without escalating cost or revealing new hierarchy of values. Final pivot from victim to weaver is declared, not dramatized—no micro-choice on the page forecloses the old stance. Motive remains atmospheric rather than causal under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lagoon reweights memories into collective bridge, cost felt in “tears...purifying.” Drive lens (Accumulative) holds—pattern of echo, hum, glow tightens to final cadence. Orientation anchor clear by 50 words; no penalty. Causality thin: ripple-hum response is magical coincidence, not earned by prior agency; still, the lyrical reconfiguration satisfies the required RR/CR with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<comment>Sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are atmospherically rich; selective sensory detail (hum, glow, ripple) mirrors internal state without checklist overload. Micro-setting—the stone perch—literally supports the pivotal beat, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no prop drift. World rules remain poetic-consistent; “liquid memory” accepted as taught metaphor. Stakes would lose shimmer if setting swapped—setting is integral to texture and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—memory disentanglement—signaled early. Pressure deepens via sensory intensification (hum-glow crescendo) rather than causal narrowing; one meaningful tightening achieved under Accumulative lens. Cost is emotional but diffuse; no concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page. Escalation is lyrical, not tactical—sufficient for length but below 8.8 threshold where price must reshape later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: collective memory as tapestry, pain transmuted into shared art. No explicit moralizing; final image of “weaver of dreams” is resonant reconfiguration, not thesis statement. Motif of drumming returns in closing cadence, reweighted from self-soothing to communal rhythm. Ambiguity preserved—no tidy redemption—earning lingering reflection. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5+ band where particulars would need sharper ethical edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—sound-centric, synesthetic, slightly unreliable. Syntax flexes with emotional swell: longer hyphens and clauses at crescendo, short fragments at beats of awe. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor density high but patterned and taught early. Register stays within POV’s poetic lexicon; no corporate drift. Rhythm propels rather than stalls—read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no scaffold loops, no synonym churn. Occasional stacked modifiers (“auroral sorrow,” “liquid memory”) flirt with purple but serve texture and are paid off at closure. Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Opening and final lines carry image-weight without overwriting. Minor density tax for figurative saturation in mid-paragraph, but it supports rather than obscures closure. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-reshaping experiment entangling subjects into collective dream—offers fresh tilt on familiar neuro-SF trope. Transformation test: story collapses if lagoon’s sonic mirror swapped for generic lake; garden’s harmonic metaphor is specific synthesis. Risk taken with lyrical accumulative structure rather than causal plot; pays off in resonant closure. Emotional specificity high—tears repriced as communal ink. Minor deduction for echoing “shared dream” phrasing that edges toward prompt-template.</comment>
