<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “virtuously mischievous” trait is shown only once (bending rules without breaking them) and never complicates her choices under pressure; the pyramid-scheme backstory is told as label, never embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority stays generic (“heart pounding with shadowseam wonder”) and the climactic recognition of her future self is summary, not a contradictory impulse acted upon. No visible flaw or blind spot drives the mistake that activates the portal; competence is unchallenged, so the arc feels safe rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt re-weights her past “pressure” into literal diamonds, cost legible in the final image of a gleaming, purposeful bolt. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—because she inserts the bolt, therefore diamonds—but the portal jump is unmotivated by any prior failure or stakes; it simply answers a text. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty applied. One causal tightening suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is sketched with selective sensory detail (air shimmer, fungal glow) that filters through Elara’s goggles. The parallel dimension is rendered in postcard lists (“towers of time, rivers of memory”) but the final image returns to the bolt-gleam on the farm, giving the micro-object setting payoff. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single transition. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate personal pressure into literal value—signals early and tightens once when the machine activates. Pressure is coherent but external: no internal fear or competing want complicates the task; escalation is a single ratchet rather than a narrowing of options. Cost is conceptual (past pain → diamonds) rather than felt on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: trauma commodified into value. Subtext resides in the bolt’s rust-to-gleam arc, avoiding explicit thesis. The ending image reweights the premise without moralizing, but the lack of embodied cost keeps resonance mid-band. No echoing motif shifts meaning; the diamonds remain abstract currency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is light (“soft glow,” “ethereal”) but consistent. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates during portal transit. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Voice distinctiveness stops short of idiosyncrasy needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors are coherent (“light coalescing into a portal”). One mixed moment—“rivers of memory” beside “equations shimmered like stars”—is minor. Information density high; every sentence advances image or beat. Closure line is crisp and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pyramid-scheme trauma with quantum alchemy feels fresh; the bolt-as-catalyst is a specific, memorable object. Conceptual-physical world rule is taught early and followed through. Risk is moderate—portal fantasy is familiar—but the personal debt-to-diamond engine gives a non-obvious angle. Transformation test: swap bolt for generic key and the emotional logic collapses, confirming necessity.</comment>
