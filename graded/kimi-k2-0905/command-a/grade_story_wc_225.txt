<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and self-forgiveness motive stay coherent; the chess-piece fidgeting gives tactile specificity and recurs at closure. Interiority, however, leans on abstract labels (“weight of unspoken histories,” “storm within her”) rather than contradictory bodily impulses in-scene. No second character appears, so status/relationship pressure is absent; the single-POV arc works but the self-pardon feels lightly earned—thread-pulling in tapestry parallels more than personal cost. Micro-choices are visible (tracing tapestry, entering labyrinth, pulling thread) yet stakes lack a tangible forfeiture that would foreclose an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal line holds: frayed tapestry → decoding → labyrinth passage → thread message → self-reconciliation. Closure (“Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey”) lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting guilt into ongoing process; tear and “quiet resolve” show felt cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; no penalty. Drive lens is Causal; each beat is motivated by prior discovery. Minor weakness: labyrinth invitation reads slightly convenient—no prior obstacle or price paid to enter, muting escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Time-frozen village,” “woven hush,” and platinum labyrinth are sketched with selective, mood-aligned detail; sensory focus stays tight to Elara’s tactile attention (wooden chess piece, metallic shimmer). Setting quietly directs choice: tapestry border must be studied at entrance, labyrinth walls physically reflect/refract her image, cueing self-examination. Micro-object—chess piece—returns in final beat as talisman, satisfying 9+ gate. Thunder lull as environmental clock is named but never concretely presses action; thus environment aids tone more than tactic constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure tightens once: decoding tapestry → realizing king/pawn parallel → decision to enter labyrinth. Protagonist agency drives each advance; no outside rescue. Cost is largely interior (guilt acknowledgment); lack of external or material forfeiture keeps intensity conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation satisfies Causal lens but does not foreclose a live alternative path; therefore entry into 8.8+ band is blocked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring weave/labyrinth imagery: patterns externally mirror internal knots. King-sacrifices-pawn tale offers subtextual critique of Elara’s past choices without moralizing. Final reweighting—“Forgiveness is… a journey”—avids tidy moral, keeps ambiguity. Some phrasing drifts toward thematic assertion (“she realized the parallel”) where embodied moment could carry insight; still, resonance sticks via charged image of glowing thread and stilled fidget.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays steady, perceptual signature filtered through chess-tutor lens: streets become “game-board,” thread-pull a “move.” Diction favors precise tactile verbs (“tracing,” “shimmered,” “unraveled”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ruminative beats, clipped fragments for labyrinth steps. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fierce repose,” “winnow the soul”) fits concept-story register and is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, largely free of scaffold/loop; metaphor density peaks mid-story but stays purposeful. One mixed-metaphor instance: “woven hush” + “tapestry’s border” + “fray” + “knots” within three sentences causes minor coherence wobble. Pacing breathes appropriately, paragraphs varied. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; opening and final lines anchor and echo effectively. Proofing: two comma splices and a vague temporal marker (“Hours passed, or perhaps only minutes”) keep this shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Chess-guilt + metallic-labyrinth pairing is fresh; tapestry decoding as “move” merges tutor skill with soul-search, giving inevitability in hindsight. Villain-free, quiet-fantasy mode risks familiarity, but “platinum labyrinth” specificity and self-forgiveness frame elevate it. Avoids overt Alice/Theseus echoes by keeping symbolism internal. Could push further—e.g., a concrete chess stratagem mirrored in thread logic would sharpen originality—but risk level is moderate and coherent.</comment>
