<comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scars, pillbox, snow codes anchor contradictory impulses—but “unused courage waits” is stated four separate times, flattening micro-choice into label-speak. The letter in the tree crystallizes the arc, yet the pillbox beat never physically constrains a choice; its weight remains emotional shorthand. Motivation is internally consistent, but the causal pay-off between pillbox and final stance is implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The accumulative pattern of snow-codes → letter → dawn offers a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands cleanly in a Charged Poise micro-turn: “unused courage” is re-accessioned, not consumed. Persistent constraint (scars, winter that has not fully turned) shapes the final image and forecloses retreat. Cost is felt but compressed; a more embodied stake paid on the page would lift this to 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Mist and snow function as both obstacle and cipher medium; setting directs footfall and decoding tactics. “Silver hush” and tilt of earth create sensory hierarchy tuned to spy wariness. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible geography. Final dawn image re-charges earlier silver palette; however, the Bluff itself remains largely postcard, not agentive, preventing 9-band payoff.</comment>

<comment>A single stake—reclaiming courage—tightens via dwindling codes and winter’s thaw. The final choice is renunciation (pill unswallowed) foreclosing retreat; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Pressure accumulates under lens; one clear cadence shift suffices. Visceral loss (time, blood, tool) would sharpen cost legibility for 9-band entry.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through pillbox, winter, and code trail rather than exposition. Final letter risks overt thematic echo (“courage is remembered, not found”) but stays saved by its placement inside a found object discovered through agency. Ambiguity lingers: will courage ignite or fade at first spring thaw? Moral remains implicit, though a less paraphrased final line would deepen resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature favors metallic, hushed, winter lexis. Sentence rhythm modulates with breathless climb versus longer reflective cadences. No dialogue to distort. Metaphor density (“silver hush,” “forgotten veil”) is high but patterned and taught early; closure line repeats “silver and gold,” fulfilling pattern. Slight risk of purple in “mist clung…like a forgotten veil,” but internal logic holds.</comment>

<comment>Ear-test passes: varied sentence length, no template cadence runs. Phrases such as “codes in accumulated snow” are dense and do double duty. Occasional elevated register (“vouchsafe,” “Conceptual Repricing” echo) fits burned-spy diction. One paraphrase loop—fixing/remembering courage iterated—costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; props track cleanly.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Burned spy finds courage in thawing winter codes” is familiar spine, yet embroidery feels bespoke: engraved pillbox as memory vessel, snow as cipher slate, tilt of earth as emotional metronome. No trope inversion, but specificity and atmospheric commitment create fresh angles. Risk is in lyric redundancy rather than surprise; still, the synthesis rings personal, not algorithmic.</comment>
