<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather anchors contradictory memory/loss. Micro-choices (sketching, hand to glass, final dance) externalize shift from observer to participant. No second character, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Motivation stays consistent; final renunciation costs her the city but feels earned. Lacks one extra contradiction under peak pressure to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: firefly pattern thickens until it reweights belonging. One clean transition (alarm → pod → dance) keeps orientation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she abandons the drowned city but carries its rhythm—cost visible in cracked glass and sunrise. Tightening beat could sharpen earlier domino links; still, image reconfiguration with felt cost satisfies 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Glass viewport, bioluminescent lantern, cracked dome, sunrise shaft—each filters perception and constrains exits. Lantern dims as pressure rises; viewport glass fogs then fractures, guiding final urgency. Underwater city never becomes tourist list; details stay tethered to Elara’s tactile use. Meets micro-setting gate; final image charged by fractured light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. isolation—signaled early; firefly cadence externalizes it. Escalation: pattern density of lights increases, narrowing option to “dance or flee.” Cost legible: foregoes last escape seconds to mirror pulses. Agency clear, though external pressure (implosion) partly supplies clock; still, her dance is decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through light-as-language, not assertion. Firefly tapestry reconfigures belonging from place-bound to sync-based. Burnt feather’s transformation (loss → beauty) supports without overt statement. Final image avoids moral, offers resonant non-literal answer: rhythm carried, city lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature stable: star charts, algae, lantern dimming—all filtered through landscape astrologer gaze. Syntax stays sinuous, mirroring underwater drift; no head-hop. Final dance compressed into breath-length sentences under rising pressure, showing rhythmic control. Voice distinct enough; could push diction further into astrologer lexicon for 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid template. Figurative language selective (“stars trapped in a jar”) without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; information dual-loaded. Minor filter verbs acceptable under lyric mode. Final glass/sunset image crisp, no mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Underwater star-reading astrologer is fresh angle; firefly/bioluminescence merger gives specific texture. Burnt feather repurposed as transformation sigil avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric dance before implosion) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable; still, premise nods to drowned-city trope, cap 8-band.</comment>
