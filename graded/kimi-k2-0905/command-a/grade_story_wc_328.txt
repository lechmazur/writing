<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—her obsession, grief, and sudden laughter are embodied in breath and pulse. The “cosmic joke” motive crystallizes when she laughs in the alcove, renouncing control with felt cost. No second character on-page, so status dynamics N/A; her micro-choice to laugh rather than seize power is a credible, irreversible stance shift. Motivation stays legible and intensifies to the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden resets but Lena’s stance is permanently re-configured, cost felt in the “frostbitten hope that warmed her.” Causal chain holds: arrowhead pull → alcove → cryptid whisper → laughter → garden reset. Orientation anchored by word 50. One meaningful tightening only, sufficient for 700-word scope. No lens ambiguity; pattern of playful gravity taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underground garden is sensuously etched—moss scent, ozone crackle, reflective pool that shows the cryptid’s face instead of hers. Micro-setting object arrowhead constrains final choice by its hum syncing heartbeat. Spatial choreography clean: arrowhead found, pocketed, pool approached, walls seal. Weather/earthquake effect is plot device but accepted as taught. Idiom consistent; no anachronism. Detail selectively woven through action rather than catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove theory / recover colleague—signaled in paragraph 1. One tightening: phone command “Metamorphose. Now.” forces Lena from hunter to participant. Cost legible: she forfeits control, embracing absurdity. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (quake) complicates but does not resolve. No second reversal needed at this length; escalation coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges: relinquishing control transmutes grief into wonder. Subtext carried by mirror-pool showing the cryptid instead of her reflection—she sees the other, not herself. No explicit moral; final laughter is image-based answer. Bitterness→joke motif stays implicit until the laugh earns it. Ambiguity preserved: cryptids remain wild, harmony still untamed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Lena’s perceptual filter—notice of spore scent, finger-on-flint texture. Rhythm compresses under pressure: “She clutched… heart pounding.” No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows precisely. Diction slightly elevated but consistent with researcher POV. Dialogue limited to two distorted words; still carry subtext. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor controlled (“gravitationally playful” taught early).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, sentence variety strong, few adverbs. One scaffold spotted: “The arrowhead… was cold, its power dormant once more” restates prior beat but acceptable as reset signal. No mixed metaphors; ozone/earthquake imagery stays coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge. Minor paraphrase loop in garden reversion description (−0.2). Overall momentum intact; clarity never obscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid lore + grief therapy via dimensional arrowhead. “Gravitationally playful” object and static-phone oracle feel novel yet grounded. Transformation test passed—swap arrowhead for generic relic and climax collapses. Risk taken with surreal alcove mirror but paid off by re-configuring protagonist’s stance. Avoids stock tropes; researcher-as-trickster angle adds edge.</comment>
