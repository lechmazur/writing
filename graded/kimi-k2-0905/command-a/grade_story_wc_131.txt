<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward label-speak ("their motivation burned brighter now") rather than embodied contradiction; the single micro-choice—unearthing fragments—never endangers or forecloses anything, so the "visible cost" test fails; kindly/methodical is asserted, never shown to complicate tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing (visibility = being heard) but arrives via passive accumulation, not causally driven beat; orientation anchor ("who") surfaces ~135 words in—just past the safe window—and the deliberate anonymity creates mild chronic disorientation that is never exploited by the ending; one shard, no reversal, so "meaningful tightening" is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sapphire hush and pipe-chase acoustics are sensuous, selective, and POV-tinted; the library’s dark geometry guides the crawl-path and is revisited at the finale, lending micro-setting charge; however, no object or spatial constraint actively shapes the final decision—proximity remains atmospheric rather than tactical, so 9+ gate fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</comment>
<comment>Stake—"to become visible"—stays abstract; uncovering fragments raises knowledge but never tightens risk or forfeits an alternative; escalation is purely accumulative (more pieces, more voices) without a decisive turn that narrows options; felt cost is deferred to a vague future sharing, not dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</comment>
<comment>Theme of hidden voices seeking audition emerges organically through reel imagery; final line offers quiet reweighting of visibility as audibility, avoiding explicit moral; subtextual gap between caretaker anonymity and recorded voices is evocative; lacks fresh inflection—archive-as-identity is familiar territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</comment>
<comment>Third-person lyric keeps stable psychic distance; perceptual signature relies on color metaphor ("sapphire hush") and hush/echo motif rather than idiosyncratic sensory bias; syntax stays controlled, rhythms modulate with dawn’s approach; no dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone—successful but not dazzling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</comment>
<comment>Some scaffolding ("their motivation burned brighter now") and stock clusters ("piece of a cache, a collection of memories"); metaphors remain consistent but occasionally mixed ("metallic veins humming"); no loops near closure; density is moderate—many sentences do only one job; read-aloud rhythm pleasant but not propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</comment>
<comment>Hidden librarian restoring forgotten tapes is a gentle inversion of the psycho-archivist trope; setting-in-darkness and ferromagnetic fragility supply tactile specificity; concept lacks a risky or paradoxical angle, keeping freshness moderate; the "sapphire hush" coinage is the most memorable particular.</comment>
