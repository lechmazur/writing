<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the shell, the ache in her throat—but the “conflicted novelist” premise is asserted more than dramatized; no actual writing or renunciation occurs on-page, so the promised flaw/choice arc is only summarized. The cameo stories arrive as external data, not internal crucible, so the contradiction is observed, not enacted. Earned stasis is implied, but the cost is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fragment placed on the glowing tree reweights the premise—she will write, the stories will live—cost is felt in the solemn hush that follows. Causality is thematic rather than plot-level; the nexus “chooses” her, not vice-versa, so agency is passive. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cameos thickens until cadence shift in the final paragraph; lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, shell, and tree are economically re-used; the shell’s glow literally cuts the fog and guides her steps, satisfying micro-setting constraint. Sensory triage narrows to touch and hearing under rising pressure. Spatial track is clean—no impossible moves. The tree’s glowing shells charge the final image, earning the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect the shapes of different hopes”—is declared early; pressure thickens via accumulating cameos, each adding emotional density. No narrowing of options or visible price is dramatized for Elara; the risk is purely empathetic overload, not a foreclosed path. Escalation is textural, not causal; sufficient for length but stays below 8-band cost threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: remembrance as resistance to erasure. The shell’s migration from fragment to key literalizes the idea without abstract sermon. Final image reframes prior cameos as future text, offering resonant reconfiguration. Quiet, non-moralizing close satisfies the 9+ test for emergent theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres strictly to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical but disciplined—“feral nexus,” “barnacles to a rock”—texture mirrors protagonist’s writerly lens. Rhythm swells and contracts with mist density, taught early and paid off in final hush. No dialogue to test, so voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no template churn. Some lyrical compression—“swirling hush of a feral nexus”—risks purple but stays within POV lexicon. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, object, and emotional stakes. Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—“writer enters mist to collect untold stories”—is familiar; freshness comes from shell-as-key and tree-of-hopes image. Cameo device avoids typical ghost tropes by keeping figures ephemeral, non-interactive. Final reframe of novelist as archivist rather than hero offers modest inflection. Synthesis feels personal but not radically new.</comment>
