<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “scattered memory keeper” remains a label rather than a lived contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure—she drifts from discovery to discovery without staking anything. The final song arrives as felt epiphany, not earned via prior tactical failures. Emotional embodiment hovers at surface; body is mostly “hands tremble” cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn breaks and communities feel re-knit, cost implied in her now-steady hands. Causal chain is loose—mirror-crossing rules appear on demand; “because” hinges on dream-logic. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives ~80w, clear enough. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of recovered song-fragments thickens texture until final glow reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Alchemical greenhouse, mica portal, and glowing fruit create tactile specificity; micro-setting (mica shard) constrains every crossing. Endless night vs. captured-dawn fruit provides stark visual polarity. Spatial tracking clean—no impossible moves. Setting feeds texture more than tactical choice, capping at 8.8 per 9+ gate; still, sensory hierarchy stays tight to POV wonder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle realm—declared early; escalation is lyrical accumulation of song-threads rather than narrowing options. No visible price (fatigue, memory loss, social risk) appears on-page; cost is atmospheric. Agency is receptive—she “finds” and “sings,” not wager. One meaningful cadence shift at lullaby moment, sufficient for 600w Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of communal re-weaving emerges through dawn-fruit and song-fragments rather than thesis line. Final image of “tapestry of light” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext stays implicit; no character speechifies the meaning. Ambiguity remains—who exactly remembers?—creating lingering aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistently mythic-lyric; syntax stays long and incantatory, mirroring fairy-tale distance. No dialogue, so no convergence issues. Perceptual signature relies on star/dawn/glass motifs; could tilt more idiosyncratic. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse; immediacy holds. Pattern of “shimmer, fracture, glow” teaches itself early and pays off at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies across sentence lengths; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Some metaphor stacked (“fruit that glowed like captured dawns”) risks purple but fits lyric mode. No scaffold loops; a few near-repetitions (“world whispered…whispered to her”) slip in. Proofing clean; pronouns stable. Information density moderate—some sentences do single job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fairy-tale memory-weaver trope is familiar, but fusion with mica-portal mirror-orchard supplies fresh visual angle. Dawn-fruit as memory storage feels specific to this text. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal plot—yet coherence holds. Could push further by letting memory loss exact tangible cost earlier.</comment>
