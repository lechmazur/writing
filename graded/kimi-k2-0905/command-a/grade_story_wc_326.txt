<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting as embodied anxiety, the shard as tactile memory—but contradiction is only asserted (“a survivor of an error, hers but not hers”) without dramatized competing impulses. Micro-choices stay at keyboard-level; no visible cost or path foreclosed on the page. Renunciation/change is implied, not enacted. Earned Stasis not quite achieved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: death certificate glitch → search → defragment → ghost voice → earned self-redefinition. Closure lands as Charged Poise—dawn light reframes error into agency with felt conceptual cost (“no longer defined”). Minor lag: orientation anchors (who issued certificate, why system failed) withheld past 120 words without later payoff; −0.3, still beats 7.5 floor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Frost-domed observatory, humming shard, ink galaxies—selective sensory triad that constrains possible actions (cold limits stamina, shard mediates data). Snow’s acoustic hush mirrors isolation; dome glass refracts first dawn onto shard, charging final image. Spatial track clean. Missing micro-setting gate: no tool or body part directly alters tactics; caps Q3 at 8.8, but still strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove she is alive—signaled first paragraph. Single escalation: defragment narrows options to “assemble or stay erased,” visible cost in sleepless cold and dissolved ink. Agency sits at keyboard; physical risk off-page. Stakes visceral yet intellectual; cost conceptual, not tangible loss—keeps it below 8.2 ceiling for high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: system errors as mirrors for identity fragility. Motifs (shard, ink) reweighted at dawn—porcelain fragility becomes survivorship badge. Avoids explicit thesis until final clause “survivor… of the system,” a hairline thematic echo (−0.2). Resonant reconfiguration achieved without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with solitary astronomer; perceptual signature—“opal dome frosted like forgotten relic,” “galaxies in miniature.” Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under pressure, short clause at dawn release. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs minimal; occasional abstraction (“the universe was trying to communicate”) forgiven by lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density is patterned early and paid off (galaxies → data → closure), so no density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “shard seemed to hum faintly, a vibration she could feel” → redundant; −0.2. Otherwise crisp, propulsive, no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Final line earns image charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic ghost in astronomical archive rendered through ink-data divination. Risk—lyric digital gothic—pays off in closure image. Not first “death certificate glitch” tale, but specific pairing of shard+ink+opal dome feels idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
