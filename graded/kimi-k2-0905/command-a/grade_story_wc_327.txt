<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied copper-veins and quiet articulation are shown through trembling hands, soft murmurs, and final collapse; her interiority stays concrete (“she focused on them, using their movements to guide her”). The cost—physical collapse and faded veins—pays for the earned endurance of saving the language, satisfying Earned Stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the single POV keeps interiority stable, but the lack of visible flaw-driven mistake keeps this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Lira endures the diamond’s curse, language is saved, her copper veins fade as visible cost (“Lira collapsed… her copper veins faded”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-drenched beat thickens sonic texture until the diamond shatters and silence replaces cacophony. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the towers of bone…”). No causality breaks; the birds’ flight pattern is foreshadowed early and recurs to tighten the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting: its facets catch moss-glow, its inner light surges under Lira’s touch, and its shattering delivers the final image. “Towers of bone” and “luminescent moss” are filtered through Lira’s storyteller eye, never drifting into catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless—tunnel mouth → echo chamber → precipice return—every detail tethered to her goal. The canyon’s echo texture literally constrains how she must listen and sing, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the dying language—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each echo beat adds sonic density until the only path is to surrender stamina to the diamond. The tightening is singular but decisive: “the diamond responded… energy draining her with every word.” Cost is legible on-page—collapse, faded veins—under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: language as lived texture worth any bodily price. The echo-tunnel equates memory with geology; the shattered diamond re-prices art as fragility incarnate. No moralizing final paragraph—the silent canyon and fading veins let the reader feel the cost. Subtext resides in the birds’ mirrored flight: culture survives only in motion, not monuments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-limited stays tightly fused to Lira’s perceptual filter: “veins beneath her pale flesh glinting like polished metal” is a tell justified by her self-scrutiny. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for echo build-up, fragment-like beats during shatter: “The diamond responded… light exploding.” No dialogue, so voice carries all tension. Diction stays within storyteller lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Read-aloud ear is strong: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe with tension. Information density high—“copper-veined storyteller” packs identity, visual, and stakes in four words. Zero loops/scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One elided transport—“she made her way back”—is strategic compression. Final line lands on image, not explanation, propelling resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: geologic echo-canyon as archive, flawed diamond as phonograph needle, birds as living phonemes. Premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk is taken by making climax a sonic implosion rather than physical triumph. Specificity anchors fantasy in sensory detail (“jagged facets catching moss-glow”). Without the canyon/diamond/bird triad the story collapses, proving indivisible originality.</comment>
