<comment>Elara’s calm is vividly embodied in micro-gestures (trembling hands after the final note), and her sacrificial lending of heartbeat supplies a clear, scaled cost. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and her refusal to claim credit forecloses personal glory. The absence of on-page secondary characters limits relationship-as-crucible, and the borrowed-heartbeat mechanic is accepted rather than questioned, keeping her just shy of the 8-band where contradiction under pressure would be required.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrors’ permanent shift from reflection to possibility reweights the world-rule with felt cost—Elara’s fading pulse. Causal chain is lyric but intact: each lullaby note escalates resistance → surrender. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: color density and cadence tighten until the bell-toll pattern-break; cost is visible in “her own heartbeat now fainter.”</comment>

<comment>Prism parapet and wet glass act as micro-setting: light refraction literally enables the mirage brushstrokes, constraining how Elara paints. Echoing terrace supplies acoustic feedback for the lullabies, while spring rain’s spectrum sets the color palette. Spatial choreography holds as Elara steps back from the parapet after the final bell. The setting charges the final image—prism shimmer fused with her wavering pulse—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—mirrors must flip from truth to possibility—tightens once: resistance → surrender under the bell countdown. Escalation is textural: color density and heartbeat borrowing increment until surrender; cost is legible on-page (“her own heartbeat now fainter”). No false coincidence; agency is Elara’s song. The single deepening suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the price of gifting futures is subtracted from the giver’s present. Mirrors as possibility-engines reweight the concept of reflection without moralizing. Final image—prism shimmer echoing fading pulse—offers resonant non-literal answer. No late symbolism; lullabies and color spectrum recur with shifting stakes, satisfying the motif guardrail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric focalization stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices light fractures, heartbeats, silence before bells. Syntax grows breathless in parallel to rising notes, then settles into longer cadence at surrender. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible artist-poet lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature differentiates interior voice from the bell-toll environmental beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension—short fragments during mirage resistance, expansive sentence at mirror surrender. Information density high: “sunlight fractured through the wet glass, casting a spectrum” simultaneously reveals setting, tool, and stakes. No scaffold loops or contradictory metaphors. Tense stable; paragraph cuts are purposeful; final line avoids explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—mirage painter who trades heartbeats to make mirrors show futures—is non-obvious and fully committed. Lullabies-as-code and prism-after-rain are fresh sensory syntheses. Risky lyric structure pays off: color-spectrum pattern taught early, reprised at closure. Removing any core ingredient (prism, lullaby, borrowed pulse) collapses the logic, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
