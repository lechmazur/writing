<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic—“the weight of her gift,” “darkness in her own heart”—without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure until the final breath; prior beats are observational. Closure renunciation is declared, not dramatized; cost is asserted (“felt lighter”) rather than shown. Tablet-as-mirror device is clever but Elara’s values hierarchy never shifts on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: labyrinth reframed from conquest to acceptance, with faint cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fractal selves deepens until stance crystallizes; causality is loose but coherent. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no penalty. However, escalation is a single cadence shift rather than progressive tightening; one deepening suffices for band but keeps score sub-7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct and rain-soaked asphalt supply tactile, selective sensory layering; body-as-setting (boots on slick surface) constrains first move. Tablet’s glow mirrored in viaduct light creates micro-setting feedback that charges final image. Spatial choreography across fractal shards is impressionistic but trackable; no impossible positions. Environment never actively threatens or resource-shapes tactics, capping at low-7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early; pressure escalates once when she reframes conquest as embrace. Agency is contemplative traversal rather than tactical choice; no option is foreclosed until final beat. Cost is conceptual (shift in worldview) but not viscerally felt; no credible loss alters tactics. Sufficient for low-6 band but lacks visible price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-multiplicity emerges through imagistic repetition rather than statement; final reweighting avoids moralizing. Ambiguity is present—acceptance versus conquest—but complexity is more asserted than dramatized. Subtext relies on mirrored glows and hollow-eyed doppelgängers; silence between selves is effective. No tidy moral, yet insight feels slightly abstract because stakes never become visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature favors luminous visual metaphors consistent with light-based world. Rhythm modulates with long sentence swell versus clipped final line, supporting breath of realization. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within plausible lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing—“periodically eternal nature”—slips toward editorial voice, minor drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns (“urgency,” “resolve,” “truth”) where concrete image would sharpen. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor chain is coherent. One mixed vehicle: “ribbon of light” then “fractals” shifts physical logic without cue. Line-level propulsion remains steady; final paragraph lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fractal-self maze via glowing infrastructure feels fresh; tablet as recursive compass is elegant. Concept risks echoing familiar multiverse introspection but avoids technobabble. Specificity of rain-slick viaduct and rune-light coupling keeps it from generic. No bold structural risk; transformation is thematic rather than formal, holding score mid-6.</comment>
