<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s empathy is concretely shown (she smooths the fragile invitation), but her “recluse” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the decision to stop hiding is declared, not pressured by a visible on-page cost. The micro-choice hierarchy is hinted at but never forces a sacrificial trade-off. Interiority stays specific except for one “enlarged tranquility” label near the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: blank book / seeking reweights meaning with conceptual cost. Causal chain: invitation find → archive search → blank-book epiphany; each beat follows logically. One minor ellipsis (how she accesses “deepest chamber”) is tolerated at this length. Orientation is clean by 90 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Neon city outside, dust-heavy shelves inside, and the blank book as micro-setting are sketched with economy; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s quiet attention. The library constrains pace and access, but no environmental detail actively shapes the final tactic—she simply receives the blank book. Still, the atmosphere coheres and mirrors her inner shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—embrace paradox vs. stay hidden—signals early; pressure deepens via archive discoveries leading to blank-book moment. No visible price (time, risk, social credit) is dramatized; the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical. Enough for mid-high band, but not the 8+ threshold that requires a felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating image of blankness = wisdom; no overt thesis stated. “Mistake as teacher” is shown via the conclave’s vanished footprints and the empty pages. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Slight abstraction keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is quiet, tactile, dust-attuned. Syntax remains controlled, with slight lyric lift that matches bookstore hush; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. Voice never fully distinctive under pressure, preventing 8.8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and coherent—no mixed metaphors. One minor paraphrase loop (“nested paradoxes” / “contradictions” within three lines) but it misses the closure beat. Information density high; sentences multi-task.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>“Secret conclave in mundane bookstore” is familiar; freshness comes from blank book = wisdom, not stored knowledge. Risk level moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist. Specific dust/invitation details prevent full cliché but don’t transform premise beyond recognition.</comment>
