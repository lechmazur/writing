<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—nostalgia for noise vs. shelter in data—are dramatized in tactile beats (scrap pressed to glass). Interiority avoids label-speak; the shift from factual shield to pocketed hope is earned by prior causal imagery. One micro-choice (fold/place) crystallizes values under pressure. Minor: no secondary character to act as crucible, but single-POV exception holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the pocketing folds the past into a future stance, cost legible in the phrase “his to fill.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of echo/silence deepens until the cadence shift reweights meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Persistent constraint (hollow quarry) charges final image without forcing causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry-as-scar and trailer micro-setting constrain mood and supply the mirror-image for emotional void. Speaker cloth functions as portable setting-chunk whose texture returns in closure. Selective sensory economy (dust/diesel vs. smoke-filled venues) keeps density high. Environment is not just backdrop but metric for internal absence, passing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purpose after applause—tightens once via pattern intensification: each echo metaphor increases felt hollowness until the pocketing reverses valence. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. Cost is conceptual (must self-fill void) rather than tangible, but legible on page. Could wish for one sharper external complication, yet meets 8.8− band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: noise/silence, fabric/skin, quarry/self. Final image answers central question without moralizing. Ambiguity remains (what will he actually do?) yet feels charged rather than evasive. Echo motif constrains imagery throughout and reprices meaning at close, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature saturated with auditory metaphors consistent with ex-roadie ear. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for reverie, staccato fragments for dawning decision. No head-hopping. Filter verbs (“seemed”) are voice-motivated hesitation, not leakage. Read-aloud cadence controlled without algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory data, backstory, and emotional valence. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (echo/silence). Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice. Minor nominalization (“emptiness”) allowed because it internalizes quarry image. Edges 9+ boundary only because one paragraph middle drifts toward template cadence, though not in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of quarry + antique appraiser + grille cloth is fresh, yet “silence after the rock career” is recognizable terrain. Specificity of appraisal error and pocketed cloth transforms trope enough to avoid derivative cap. Risk is moderate: quiet interior arc rather than external stakes, but coherence holds. Could push further into occupational weirdness for higher band.</comment>
