<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is present but drifts into abstract “open secrets” rhetoric; micro-choice is limited to touching the microdot and deciding to travel—both under-motivated. No embodied emotion beyond “sudden surge of clarity.” Earned cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a declared decision (“began to plan”) rather than a visible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; cost is off-page. Causal chain: find specs → feel power → decide to leave is thin; lighthouse dreams are never linked to specs by concrete beat. Orientation holds, but the plot never tightens—options do not narrow, stakes do not re-weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kitchen shells, refrigerator hum, and lighthouse fog are sketched with selective sensory detail; environment never constrains choice or charges the ending. Micro-setting (microdot on fingertip) is momentarily tactile but drifts into metaphor without return. Place is atmospheric, not instrumental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“unravel mysteries / claim destiny”) is declared early but never tested; no visible price or foreclosed path. Pressure plateaus at “decide to journey”; escalation is iterative restatement of same mood. No reversal or trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>“Open secrets” theme is stated repeatedly rather than developed through event; lighthouse and microdot serve as foggy symbols without re-pricing the premise. Final image of fortunes whispering is atmospheric but does not reweight prior material. Theme stays abstract, emerges from narration not experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent hush-and-glow register; syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates with breath. Perceptual signature limited to “cryptic” diction but avoids filter clutter. Voice is the strongest layer yet remains ornamental—never complicates or charges the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Line craft is clean: no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Density is moderate; some sentences iterate mood synonymously (“enigmatic fortunes,” “familiar enigma”) without new pressure. Final third stays legible, but figurative language never sharpens—keeps same dusk-soft lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fortune-cookie writer + microdot espionage is a fresh mash-up; lighthouse quest feels appended rather than synthesized. Conceptual spark is present yet execution drifts into mood-piece, not surprise turn. Specificity of Chinatown restaurant vs. generic “rocky island” keeps it from full transformation.</comment>
