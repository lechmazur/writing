<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—restore harmony via the “bloom of hush”—is declared early and never complicated by contradictory impulse; interiority is poetic but generic (“her heart steady”), not character-specific. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the single decisive act (laying the stone) is abstract, its cost off-page. The ending renunciation is implied, not dramatized, so the required visible cost for 9+ is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain—cracks → path → seed → song—holds; orientation (who/where) is clear by line 5. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bloom unfurls, storm abates, silence ripples out; the cost (Lira’s weariness) is asserted, not felt. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the echo stone is helper, not hindrance. Meets 600-word default; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Caves, ice veins, and seed are vividly lit (“gently luminous glow,” “shimmering petals”) and filter through Lira’s map-keeper gaze. Spatial choreography stays clean; distance and motion track. The caves’ hum evolves from warning to lullaby, mirroring conflict arc. However, environment never materially blocks or enables a choice; it’s backdrop, not crucible—hence 9-band gate fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the storm—signals early; pressure escalates only descriptively (“air growing heavier”) rather than through narrowed options. One meaningful turn: seed is dormant → Lira conjures “song of silence”; the cost is poetic, not tactical. No credible loss alters her method; bloom solves problem it didn’t help create. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not causal tightening; suffices for short form but lacks 8.8+ bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as restorative counter-force to chaos—emerges through image chain (hum → bloom → lullaby) without explicit moral. Subtext is thin; silence is praised, not questioned. Final image reweights prior noise, offering quiet as conceptual repricing. Avoids sermon, yet complexity is single-note; ambiguity is present but shallow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Lira; no head-hop. Prose has rhythmic lift, tactile diction (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “hammered repose”) that feels map-keeperly. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor consistent (sound = light = path). Minor cadence repetition (“gently luminous” used twice) dulls edge but not at closure. Voice distinct enough for 8-band; lacks idiosyncrasy for 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template runs. Information density good—each sentence advances image or motion. Mixed metaphors absent, but occasional elevated diction (“cacophony of power”) nudges above POV lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “gently luminous glow” echoed immediately; minor. Closure line is clean, resonant. Good polish, not immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>“Bloom of hush” concept freshens standard “quiet defeats chaos” trope; ice-crack cartography gives tactile novelty. Energy beings remain off-page placeholders, sapping specificity. Synthesis feels prompt-driven, not lived. Risk is moderate; execution competent but not unforgettable.</comment>
