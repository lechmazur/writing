<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority stays abstract (“felt important,” “strange pull”) without embodied contradiction; the decisive moment—offering the clock—reads as instinctive rather than earned by prior visible flaw or want. No micro-choice under pressure shows a value hierarchy; the archive’s revival feels gifted, not wrested. The dreamless trait is label-only, never dramatized as perceptual limit or cost. Closure reaches Charged Poise, but character cost is ambient, not personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she clasps the charm, the dune pulls her; because she lifts the clock, the archive reignites. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—archive diverges, clock restarts—yet the cost is borne by the world, not the protagonist, so the price test is only weakly met. One causal gap: the clock’s prior irrelevance is told, never shown in stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glowing sand, floating orbs, and the silver wave charm deliver sensory specificity and constrain choice (she must clasp the charm to descend). The dune-as-character actively guides her feet and hums, integrating setting with beat-level action. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The archive’s dying light mirrors the stakes, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—cultivate sparks—remains thematic until the final beat; no intermediate obstacle tests or narrows Mara’s options. Escalation is atmospheric (archive dims) rather than agency-driven; the revival is achieved by presenting the clock, not by a trade-off or renunciation. Pressure is coherent under Situational lens but never tightens; the archive’s revival feels like a密钥 rather than a cost. No visible price is exacted from Mara, so the high-band cost gate is missed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of divergence vs. preservation emerges concretely through the archive’s shifting shelves and new jars, avoiding overt thesis. The lullaby motif returns only as ambient label (“fractured lullaby”) without later reweighting. Subtext stays thin: no silence, gesture, or irony complicates Mara’s stance. Final image is resonant but conceptually priced by the world, not the character’s moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is generic (“otherworldly light,” “strange pull”) rather than idiosyncratic. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately—short sentences under vortex pressure, longer ones for descent. No dialogue to test subtext or idiom. Diction stays within guard’s plausible lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is clean; sentence openings vary. Two mild scaffold spots: “its light… its light” in adjacent clauses; “the dune whispered… the dune responded” repeats noun+verb frame. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density is good—each line advances image or action. Closure beat is free of figurative muddle. Minor synonym churn (“glowing… luminescent… shimmering”) dampens precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of quantum-charm, chess-clock, and memory-archive feels fresh and specific to this world. The dreamless guard concept is under-exploited but still novel. Familiar “last oasis” frame is re-inflected by the archive’s divergent futures. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. The synthesis lands as inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
