<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and character-specific—her trembling hands, the “texture of time” obsession—but the emotional turn at the pedestal feels rushed; the ancestor torrent is told, not embodied. The micro-choice to place the fragment is present, yet the cost (loss of the fragment, altered self) is asserted rather than felt on the page. Still, the hedge-maze obsession drives every beat, so motive stays coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze fixes its geometry and her memory sharpens, paying a conceptual price (fragment gone, self rewritten). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory swell thickens until the vortex reweights the stakes. The “ancestor slideshow” is summary, not dramatized beat, so the cost is slightly muffled, but the final image of the now-static labyrinth crystallizes the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is the star: the breathing vines, scent-loaded air, and warping hedges constrain her path and mood. Hyperbolic geometry is named, not diagrammed, yet the spatial distortion is felt through her quaking legs. The living bridge garden is more than postcard—it actively swallows the fragment and re-spits her changed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost memory/time texture—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment heats. One meaningful escalation: the maze’s geometry snaps from elastic to Euclidean after the sacrifice, foreclosing further travel. Cost is conceptual (fragment lost, self reconfigured) rather than viscerally felt, but it is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of memory decay vs. restoration emerges through the concrete arc of the fragment and the restored photographs; no explicit moralizing. The closing image of the now-static maze reweights the earlier “retrocognitive entrapment” trope into earned stasis. Avoids tidy profundity—ambiguity lingers about whether the gain was worth the erasure of the fragment’s mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception—roots “whisper,” air “crackles”—without POV slippage. Syntax swells and contracts with maze tension; final paragraph cadence settles into calm, mirroring the spent labyrinth. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction is elevated but consistent with her designer precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Prose is sensorily dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold—“the maze was…, it was as though…”—in two spots. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with breath-length sentences during vortex, then tightens at exit. Information density high; each sentence layers scent, sight, or motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze-as-time-machine fused with halo archaeology. Not wholly novel, but the retrocognitive entrapment mechanic and the living bridge ecosystem are particularized. Risk—hyperbolic geometry—is named more than demonstrated, slightly softening ingenuity. Still, the restored-photograph payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
