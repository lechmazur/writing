<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is present but generic; “bravely conflicted” is repeatedly asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The decision to copy the data feels inevitable, not driven by a visible flaw or compounded mistake. No embodied emotion under sub-zero conditions; breath-visible is reused thrice without fresh sensory twist. The arc is a single slide from hesitation to action without intermediate beats that force her values to collide.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clean—letter → descent → terminal → download—but escalation is declared (“the clock was ticking”) rather than tightened by on-page obstacles. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the snow-covered exit image reweights her world, yet the cost is only abstract (“her world would never be the same”) without a concrete price shown. Drive lens is Causal; linkage holds but lacks a final constraining consequence that forecloses retreat. Orientation is met before 120 words; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The cryogenic library is economically evoked through frosted glass and humming terminal; snow-muffled acoustics mirror the “dizzying quiet” motif. Setting constrains action only by cold, but cold never endangers or slows Elara’s dexterity, so stakes remain cosmetic. No object or body-detail recurs to charge the final image; the letter is discarded rather than repurposed. Still, sensory selection stays tight to POV priorities—archivist notices data layers, not décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“provoke an unspoken conversation”—is clear early, but the only escalation is the off-stage system alert; no visible trap or forfeiture materializes on the page. Elara’s agency is binary: she downloads or she doesn’t; no intermediate adaptation, lost tool, or rising penalty. The scandal is deferred to the future, so the beat lacks a present-tense cost that narrows options now. One meaningful tightening occurs, but it is narrative shorthand rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed truth versus order emerges implicitly through the archives’ existence, but the final paragraph spells out the thesis (“the fragility of truth and the cost of bravery”) instead of letting the snow image reprice it. No recurring micro-motif reweights at closure; “contraband truths” is repeated without fresh angle. Subtext is thin because Elara has no on-page witness to persuade or deceive. Ambiguity is gestured at but not embodied in a concrete after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is serviceable—“cryogenic archivist” notices data strata and silence—but diction defaults to Latinate abstractions (“conceptualized,” “network’s activation”) that flatten voice under stress. Rhythm is steady, not modulated to the download frenzy; no fragment burst or clause compression. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it leans on adjective-noun pairs (“endless fall,” “vast halls”) that feel template-generated. Still, no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is acceptable, but “the library’s silence” is reused four times within 700 words, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls immediacy. Overwriting intrudes: “echoing faintly in the vast space” is redundant after “echoing library.” Mixed metaphor—“a ghost in the machine”—is dropped without payoff. Information density is moderate; several sentences could lose “that” clauses. No typos or pronoun drift, but micro-scaffold remains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Cryogenic library preserving contraband truths” is a fresh synthesis, combining climate-controlled archive with data dissidence. However, the dormant-network reveal follows standard cyber-thrill beats without subversion. Elara’s archivist profession is under-leveraged—no cataloguing jargon or conservation dilemma unique to cryogenics. Snowed-in secrecy is evocative but not transformed beyond backdrop. Risk level is moderate; concept entertains but does not upend genre expectations.</comment>
