<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s indexing logic is merely asserted (“logical page indexer”) rather than dramatized; her only cataloguing act is to realign a single map, so the occupational lens never alters tactics. The interiority is vivid (“dappled resolve”) but too distilled—no moment of contradictory impulse under pressure. The antique stamp is the true actor; her motivation is stable, so no visible cost attaches to her final choice. A stronger crucible would have forced her to stamp something that destroys her own prior index, making her profession hurt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → isolation → stamp-triggered reveal. The map-readjustment beat supplies the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the city’s founding myth is rewritten. Orientation is anchored by 60 words; no disorientation serves closure, so the test is waived. Closure earns resonance because the stamp’s glow literalizes “honest origins,” but the library’s physical rules (how walls shift, why ink glows) are late-introduced magic; a hairline deduction for convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting is the stamp and algae-lit shelves; both constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—indexer’s fingers on spines, ink smell submerged under water-rot. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her single lantern circle. Environment evolves: blackout deepens, walls pivot. One slight over-telling—“reclaimed stillness” repeated three times—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover untainted origins—tightens when the map threatens to expose complicity. Agency is present: she chooses to stamp, knowing the library will reconfigure. Cost is conceptual (heritage rewritten), not personal; stakes never risk her safety or identity. Escalation is linear, single-turn; no secondary pressure complicates the path, so the tightening is meaningful but not layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth buried in margins—emerges through map symbols; no direct statement until final paragraph, sparing us sermon. Subtext is thin: the library’s prior manipulations are told, not shown in marginalia. Resonant reconfiguration lands via glow, yet moral complexity is absent; the city’s rulers are faceless, so the thematic aftereffect is intellectual rather than ethically unsettling. Still, particulars outweigh abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—cataloguer’s taxonomic eye (“weathered tomes,” “faint traces of ink”). Rhythm modulates: long sentences for submersion, fragment bursts at wall-shift. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Filter verbs appear but feel like curator caution; no head-hop or register drift. Final image of glowing stamp in hand is a Charged Poise worthy of 9+ territory, but earlier decorative adjectives (“reclaimed stillness”) dull the blade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety carries the dive. Information density high—each sentence advances setting or motive. One paraphrase loop: “stillness” echoed three times in 200 words; subtract 0.2. Metaphors are coherent (library as “old friend”), no mixed vehicles. No scaffold, no synonym churn. Closure beat is clean; no artifact touches the final stamp glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sunken-library-as-memory-vault is fresh; the stamp-as-key inverts the usual key-as-object trope. Still, “blackout reveals hidden city map” edges toward video-game puzzle; risk is moderate. Specificity of indexer’s tools (ink stamp, algae light) keeps it from template. Transformation test passes: swap indexer for generic explorer and the emotional charge collapses. No famous echoes; voice feels singular, if too reverent.</comment>
