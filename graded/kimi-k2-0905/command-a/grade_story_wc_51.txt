<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush—her grip on the lamp biting into palm, the calcified soul-layers—yet the “fractal weaver” label stays mostly ornamental until the final self-weaving beat; a stronger mid-scene contradiction between collector duty and self-preservation would have pushed her into the 9 band. The renunciation lands with cost, but the figure’s temptation never truly tests her hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara turns the weaving method inward, lamp flame steadying to signal irreversible shift; cost is felt in the crack inside her and the foregone hand-off of others’ burdens. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each sensory layer (damp earth, metallic tang, star-mosaic ceiling) tightens the stake until the final cadence lifts. Orientation anchors by line 4, no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Bronze grotto operates as micro-setting: walls gleam, star-slits pulse with breath, lamp warmth counters the metallic chill—details constrain her choice to stay seated and re-weave. The kerosene burner evolves from prop to talisman, its flame sharpening at the exact moment she pivots inward, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never ghost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect vs. release burdens—tightens once when the figure offers the hand-off; Elara’s refusal crystallizes stance and forecloses external rescue. Cost is legible: internal crack widens, lamp flame steadies to mark new solitary path. A second tightening would have secured 9+ territory, but single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: bearing others’ grief calcifies the bearer; final image of self-weaving reweights earlier “shingled hush” from altruism to self-preservation. No moralizing—meaning resonates through flame and cracked soul. Ambiguity lingers: is she free or frozen? Complexity maintained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains whalebone reverie cadence—long vowels, cavernous consonants—without slipping into purple overload. Perceptual signature is Elara-tilted: air “thick,” starlight a “mosaic,” burner a “grounding force.” No POV leakage; figure’s speech stays alien, whale-boned, distinct. Compression in peak beat mirrors her held breath, then releases.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene—paragraph lengths swell and contract like lungs. Metaphors stay coherent (fractal, spider-web, calcite) and payoff at closure. One scaffold near “boundary-lessly trapped” repeats concept-label twice; minor loop but does not touch final image. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>“Shingled hush” as operational silence, “fractal weaver” as grief-mathematician—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable after the final beat. Risk taken: quiet interior fantasy with no external explosion, yet stakes feel cosmic. Intellectual metaphor grounded in sensory grotto and bodily cost. No recognizable template echoes.</comment>
