<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—"to defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared early and repeated, but never complicates: she never doubts, falters, or chooses against her own mantra. Interiority stays on one note of benevolent resolve; no contradictory impulse is enacted in-scene. The only micro-choice with cost—igniting the rag-knot high above her head—reads as heroic confirmation rather than risk or renunciation. Earned change lies in the crowd, not in Lira, so the arc feels external and safe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new fire-image layers luminescence onto the fortress until the mosaic sun refracts the same light back. Closure is a legit Resonant Reconfiguration—the glowing mosaic re-prices the setting from ruin to beacon—but the cost is borne by anonymous spectators, not the protagonist. Causality between chant-rhythm and ignition is asserted, not shown; the rag never endangers her plan or limits options. Still, the final image cleanly crystallizes the before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is more mood-board than constraint: vines "shimmer," fountain "stands," walls "bloom," but none of these features resists or enables Lira’s moves. The kerosene rag becomes the de-facto micro-setting that travels with her, yet it never malfunctions, runs short, or threatens her fingers—hence no tactical squeeze. Spatial geography inside the courtyard stays impressionistic; crowd distance and exit vectors are absent. The fortress is vivid wallpaper, not a lever that shapes tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the fortress populace’s morale—is signaled early and tightens only once: from wilted silence to cheers. The single meaningful escalation is the mosaic reveal; it is beautiful but costless for Lira, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Agency stays cosmetic—she never risks failure, scarcity, or social push-back. Because luck never complicates and no option is closed off, the conflict remains a one-way uplift escalator.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-illumination emerges organically via recurring fire-and-light imagery rather than exposition. Subtext stays shallow—no darker underside complicates the idea that beauty equals salvation. The mosaic sun re-weights the initial "no stars" premise, so the conceptual repricing lands, yet the insight arrives gift-wrapped rather than wrested. Audience reflection is invited but channeled toward a single feel-good answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a burnished, incantatory cadence that mirrors chant patterns. Diction stays elevated but consistent ("testament to resilience," "ambient awareness"); no POV leakage or sudden jargon. Filter verbs appear only when necessary; perceptual signature is generic-wanderer rather than idiosyncratic. Repetition of "bloom," "light," "chant" is deliberate patterning, not scaffold, and pays off in the final flare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with purposeful anaphora and clause-variation that propels the ritual pace. Occasional velvet overlay ("shimmered faintly in the fading light") risks purple but stays within voice. No loops, paraphrase churn, or mixed metaphors; spatial and temporal sequences stay clear. One dangling participle and two adjective stacks nudge it off perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combining fireworks ritual with mosaic craft is fresh, yet the hope-healer wanderer is a recognizable trope. The no-risk execution plays safe—no kerosene spill, no crowd panic, no authority push-back—so ingenuity feels cushioned. Specific detail (petal shards in grout) keeps it from generic allegory, but the template could swap in "musician with wind chimes" without structural change. A daring half-step rather than a leap.</comment>
