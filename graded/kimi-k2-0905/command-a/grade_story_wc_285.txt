<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coachman’s motive is stated but never pressured; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice tests his resolve. Yarn needle remains emblem, never weapon or sacrifice; interiority drifts into prompt-echo (“distill complexity into essence”) rather than embodied stakes. Closure is pure acceptance, no cost visible on page—he simply listens, nods, drives on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal spine holds: needle → stranger → scroll → recognition. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Yet closure beat is summary—“the promise is yours now”—with no concrete alteration of options or price; causality lands soft, not decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fog, river, ticking gutters supply textured micro-setting that filters POV attention. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of gutters as clock) integrates with stakes. Environment never actively obstructs or enables choice, so caps below 9. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode promise before gutters cease—signaled early. But escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: fog lifts, figure delivers answer, time expires without protagonist action narrowing options. No visible cost or foreclosed path; pressure remains ambient, not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Palimpsest metaphor emerges organically via scroll reveal, but theme is articulated aloud by stranger, not dramatized through coachman’s struggle. Final line reweights prior images cleanly, yet insight feels gifted rather than earned through costly choice. Ambiguity present, but lacks visceral after-shock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“spindrift serenity,” “percolate”) borders on mannered but stays coherent. Rhythm modulates with fog imagery; no head-hop. Dialogue brief, serviceable, subtext thin. Voice distinctive enough for venue, not yet unforgettable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with purposeful repetition of “percolate,” “palimpsest,” “spindrift.” Figurative layering dense but consistent; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) slightly above coachman’s likely lexicon, yet doesn’t rupture lyric contract. Strong read-aloud cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fog-bound oracle scene is familiar; palimpsest-as-life-lesson has recent workshop currency. Freshness lies in yarn needle repurposed as mnemonic rather than sewing tool, and rain-gutter clock. Risk level modest; concept feels prompted rather than lived-in. Specificity of coachman’s craft remains generic.</comment>
