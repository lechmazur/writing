<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete, her “quiet drive” shown through sustained night-work and the pilgrimage to the cathedral; the moonflower memory anchors motive without lapsing into label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on page, so the internal conflict remains suggested rather than enacted. The final endurance (“she had captured…her own peace”) is credible but the cost is more asserted than felt. Single-POV design keeps characterization coherent, yet the absence of live opposition limits pressure and micro-choice hierarchy.</comment>

<comment>Causal spine holds: dream → postcards → journey → mural; each beat follows because/therefore logic and the closure image (completed canvas as “testament”) delivers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she can now “see” beauty in darkness. Orientation is secure by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The tightening is singular rather than escalating, so the plot never risks a real fork; still, the through-line is clean and the final beat reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s painter-eye: “amber pavilion,” “shards of color,” “etched glass…whispered secrets.” Spatial choreography is ghosted but not violated; the cathedral’s scale is evoked more than walked. Weather shift from “last snow” to spring is tracked and mirrored in internal thaw. The environment does not constrain tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the atmosphere is texturally rich and purposeful.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“can she externalize the dream?”—is signaled early; pressure is internal and accumulative rather than antagonistic. One meaningful deepening occurs inside the cathedral when the windows’ emotional density reweights the task. No visible price is dramatized (time, money, relationships) so cost remains conceptual; this caps intensity below 7.4. Agency is present but risk-free; luck does not intrude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty’s persistence in darkness is shown through night-blooming moonflower → stained-glass dawn → finished mural. No final-paragraph moralizing; the closing line offers a Charged Poise that reweights prior images. Ambiguity is modest but present—the flowers bloom at night “because” darkness is fertile ground for seeing. The insight is earned yet leans toward the aphoristic; slightly more concrete sting would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and consistent: “colors that seemed to breathe,” “umbral tenderness.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens under awe, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is stable. The lyric diction occasionally drifts toward the poetic essay, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final cadence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Figurative language is dense but patterned and coherent—“dawning hush” recurs without mixed metaphors. One scaffold pair detected: “She knew…she realized” in closing paragraph; it is brief and does not touch closure. No synonym loops or template cadence. Information density is high; each sentence advances motive, image, or time. Clean proofing; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—painter reconstructs dream cathedral via vintage postcards—is fresh but not radical; the moonflower-as-metaphor is familiar. Freshness lies in the synesthetic compression of glass, light, and sound into a single perceptual quest. Risk is stylistic (lyric accumulation) rather than structural; it succeeds, but the concept could transplant to another artist with minor edits. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not startling.</comment>
