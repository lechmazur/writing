<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—her insomnia is shown through nightly climbs, stool-sitting, pulse-checking brush. Contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. urgency) coexist in scene, but the “remember kindness” motive is stated more than dramatized; no micro-choice tests it under pressure. Endurance of dawn vigil carries faint cost (fatigue acknowledged) yet feels more aesthetic than crucible. Voice remains painter-specific; no head-count or status issues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight, brush, and canvas build density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—painting becomes bridge, greenhouse air re-prices from smog to jasmine; cost is felt in her spent wakefulness and the irrevocable shift from viewer to vessel. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no因果 breaks. Lacks a persistent constraint that later shapes tactics, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humidity-fogged glass, stool, indigo ink pot—each object is handled and constrains posture/tool choice. Smog/jasmine toggle is sensory and mirrors internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The moon is used, not just viewed, charging final canvas glow. Could use one more tactile interaction (floorboards, vent) to hit 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rouse lost language; signaled early via brush hum. Tightening occurs when vision hijacks her hand—options narrow from self-expression to transcription. Cost is emotional breathlessness and irrevocable dawn exhaustion; visible but not resource-loss. Agency is partial—brush as co-actor—keeping escalation one notch below high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges：memory as communal kindness encoded in lost signs. No overt thesis; final “bridge” image reconfigures prior insomnia into stewardship. Subtext lives in brush warmth vs. cold smog. Avoids moralizing, but thematic counter-readings limited—no doubt or cruelty tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “waxing moon … danced across her canvas.” Rhythm modulates—long humid clauses vs. short breathless strokes under vision. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs kept purposeful (“seemed to pulse”). Stable distance; pattern of moon → brush → canvas taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences avoid template cadence. Information dense: one line delivers humidity, light angle, and emotional tilt. Minor paraphrase loop “lost language … forgotten” repeated conceptually −0.2. Metaphors consistent (moonlight/ink). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. No typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Moon-tipped calligraphy brush as visionary conduit is fresh; avoids stock magic-item beats. Lost city painted into being rather than visited feels specific to painter-insomniac. Combination of smog-city rooftop + mooncall + language archaeology is non-obvious synthesis. Risk level moderate—no structural experiment—but interior twist carries charm.</comment>
