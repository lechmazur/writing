<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, tactile diligence is vivid, but the interior contradiction promised by the speck’s “pull” stays abstract; we see her “heart race” yet no embodied friction or micro-choice that costs her anything on the spot. The final “shift” is declared rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the speck’s glow reconfigures her identity from sorter to “guardian” with conceptual cost, and the Accumulative lens holds—each monument beat thickens density until the final image crystallizes. Causality stays loose (the speck “chooses” her), but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last lit circle, so the lens ambiguity cap is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arbor’s ash-grey hush is filtered through Elara’s seed-sorting fingertips—wood scent, leaf whisper, fire-shadow—so environment and body are one micro-setting. The moonstone’s glow finally charges the monument circle, satisfying the 9+ gate, though spatial choreography beyond her lap remains sketchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or lose the prophecy—surfaces early; pressure tightens when the speck glows brighter after each monument addition, foreclosing the option to remain a mere sorter. Cost is conceptual (identity upgrade) rather than visceral, keeping the beat just shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—attention as consecration—emerges through the monument ritual; the final lit circle reweights earlier seed-sorting as sacred archive without moralizing. The mossy-delight tone stays consistent, letting theme breathe in image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s tactile diction (“calloused yet gentle,” “mossy delight”) and modulates cadence as glow intensifies; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature is present under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; only minor scaffold (“the once orderly seed sorter had become…”) repeats known info. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high through the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Seed-sorting as divination, moonstone dust as archive key—specific synthesis feels fresh, not checklist. Risk is modest (quiet lyric arc), but the charged monument circle offers a memorable visual reconfiguration that would collapse if swapped out.</comment>
