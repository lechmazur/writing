<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven need to “crystallize a fleeting emotion” is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“mirage of safety,” “fragility”) rather than embodied contradiction; the ash-scattering choice is legible yet feels pre-decided, so the moment registers as ritual rather than costly renunciation. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the final poise carries earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ash settling reweights the mask and chair, making impermanence legible with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each repetition of “mirage” and “shatter” deepens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gallery is sketched via selective detail—dim sconces, marble echo, rocking-chair creak—filtered through Elara’s vigil. The mask’s jagged edges and the ash’s drift constrain her final gesture, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains stable; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the dead by fixing impermanence—is signaled early and tightens via sensory accumulation: each creak, glint, and ash grain narrows options toward the single permissible gesture. Cost is visible as the ash settles on the floor, foreclosing further contact. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “safety as mirage” emerges through object trajectory: the once-protective mask, now shattered, and the stopped rocker dramatize the illusion. Final image of ash as “silent benediction” reconfigures the concept without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“powder the air,” “silent benediction”) carries lyrical texture without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for reverence, fragments for ash motes—maintaining control under pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“ash…dancing”) stay coherent and localized. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to whisper,” “felt a strange connection”) but it clears before the final beat, leaving closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept of scattering portrait-ash inside a fractured-safety gallery feels fresh; the ritual elevates a familiar grief trope via object specificity. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could edge higher with sharper micro-surprise within the ritual.</comment>
