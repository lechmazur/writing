<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s sorrow-into-lanterns reflex is concrete from line 1; the shift to unfolding origami is an embodied micro-choice that externalizes internal contradiction. Interiority stays specific (“his craft felt hollow”) rather than label-speak. The final stance crystallizes through the causal chain of folded-then-unfolded cranes, but the emotional plateau is slightly too smooth; a sharper cost in the basilica moment would have earned 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Kael’s release of the crane-shield reconfigures meaning and the island ascends—Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. Causal lens holds: because he keeps folding grief, therefore the basilica shows him the shield; because he unfolds it, therefore the island rises. Orientation supplied by ~80 words; transitions only one (bench → basilica) and is legible. No causality breaks, no soft resets.</comment>

<comment>Floating island tea garden is sketched with scent and motion (“mist clung…like a lover’s whisper”) and seeds the paradoxical descent/ascent rule early. Dreamstone and glass basilica are tactiley handled. Micro-setting of the origami crane on the altar serves as the charged final object. Environment does not physically constrain tactics, so caps at 7.8; still, enough specificity to feel lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Kael stay trapped in crafted grief or risk feeling it?—is signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when Lira tells him “grief is meant to be felt,” stripping his crafting defense; this narrows options and forces the basilica choice. Cost is felt (knees sink, light softens), although the external price is more imagistic than material. Sufficient escalation for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: craft as shield vs. craft as homage. Subtext lives in the creases—folding = control, unfolding = surrender. Final image of lantern “to honor it” reweights prior lanterns without moralizing. Slight deduction because Lira’s “grief is meant to be felt” flirts with thesis statement; still, the crane-to-unfold reprise rescues resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Kael’s perceptual filter; “calloused from years of gem polishing” grounds occupational idiom. Syntax flexes with pressure (“hands stilled…sank to his knees”). No head-hopping; Lira’s voice remains external. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext. Final line cadence mirrors release with soft consonants—“honor it”—satisfying ear test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean; information density high (“vessels for dream recording, capturing fragments…”). Metaphors occasionally layer (“mist…lover’s whisper,” “luminous torment”) but stay within POV lexicon. No scaffold loops; only mild paraphrase near basilica entry. One mixed image—“light shifted, casting his shadow in sharp relief”—shadows don’t form inside translucent walls; −0.3, but does not touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy grief-craft is familiar, yet the origami-crane-as-detached-shadow feels fresh. Dream-recording lanterns plus paradox island synthesize into a specific cultural micro-world. Transformation test passes: removing origami folding breaks the arc. Risk lies in quiet ending; coherence maintained. Not radically novel, but particularized enough to transcend trope.</comment>
