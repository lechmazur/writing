<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered and tied to the puppet, but her contradictory impulses stay abstract (“doubt crept in” vs. “renewed determination”) without embodied micro-choice that alters tactics; the blood-offering is the single visible cost yet reads ritual rather than character-specific. No relationship crucible or status shift on page, so the arc is solitary and mostly symbolic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the puppet’s smile and steady beam reconfigure meaning with felt cost (her ragged breath, spent blood). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral layers tighten until cadence shifts at “blade of hope.” Orientation clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. Could edge higher if the cost were persistent rather than momentary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse, dusk light, salt air, and stone floor are filtered through Elara’s tactile ritual; the beam’s stutter directly alters her urgency. Micro-setting (porcelain shard biting skin) constrains the act. Final image of the blade-like beam recharges earlier bruised sky, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the clock strike midnight?”—is abstract but made visceral via the flickering beam and failing hush; one meaningful tightening when her lullaby falters and she bleeds onto the shard, narrowing options. Escalation is textural (glow spreading) rather than causal, fitting the lens. Cost visible but not carried forward as constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “beautifully flawed” emerges through the mending ritual and mirrored cracks; no moralizing statement. Final image reframes earlier bruised sky into blade of hope, offering resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains: the puppet will break again, so the thematic question lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “pane of hush,” “bruised awe,” rhythmic anaphora mimic lullaby cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) feels ritual-apt rather than intrusive; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variety and sensory density; only minor scaffold (“the hush seemed heavier, as if…”) and one mixed metaphor (“blade of hope” is literal beam yet metaphor). No loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language stays coherent under pressure. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Doomsday clock adjuster” and singing broken puppet via nested lullaby patterns feel fresh; concept synthesizes apocalypse-tending caretaker with fragile art-object. Risk is lyric stillness rather than plot twists, but specificity of lighthouse ritual keeps it from generic solarpunk or clockmaker tropes.</comment>
