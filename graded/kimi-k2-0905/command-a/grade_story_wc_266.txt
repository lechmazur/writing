<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “unused courage” motive is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulse; she drifts rather than chooses. The ferryman’s youthful double is announced without prior internal logic, so his second appearance feels conjured, not earned. Interiority relies on abstract labels—“the leash had broken,” “she was free”—instead of embodied cost. The result is a protagonist who registers as symbol rather than person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Charged Poise: the blank ticket and air-punch transfer the star stamp to Mara herself, a clean conceptual re-pricing. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict; the indirect river path and misty ridgeway tighten texture until the final image reweights the premise. The ferryman’s age-slip is unmotivated and risks a late rule change, but it does not break the lyric pattern already taught. Cost is felt: the ticket’s erasure and the ferryman’s final “go” foreclose return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt-air dusk, scarred hull, mist-cloaked ridge—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s fatigue. The ridgeway functions as micro-setting: its serpentine climb narrows her perceptual field, making the final cliff-edge stance legible. “Shoreline lullaby” diction is sustained without purple drift; sound and scent are balanced. One minor slip: “ancient trees” leans generic, but the grove is quickly abandoned for tactile sand and stream-song, keeping atmosphere alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>A single dominant stake—Mara’s search for her own courage—is signaled early and deepens through traverse fatigue and blank-ticket panic. Pressure is textural: mist thickens, path steepens, stamp disappears; options narrow symbolically rather than through causal opposition. No antagonist or reversal is required under the lyric-accumulative lens, yet the absence of a visible trade-off keeps escalation gentle. The final air-punch is agency, but its cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: traverse > destination, courage as self-imprint. The ticket punch’s migration from paper to body literalizes the motif without sermon. Twilight vigil stays implicit, refracted through ferryman’s “hour of vigils” and Mara’s blank ceiling nights—never thesis-stated. Final image invites counter-readings: is the stamp empowerment or brand? That ambiguity lingers, earned by concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-person lyric hovers close to Mara’s sensorium; diction—“gauzy light,” “salt and secrets”—matches shoreline lullaby register without floral excess. Syntax relaxes into tidal cadence, then shortens during ascent: “She punched the air,” a crisp climactic fracture. Ferryman’s dialogue carries subtext in its brevity; age-shift is the single POV tremor, but it is brief and pattern-coherent. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices texture first, horizon second, interior last.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Rhythm modulates with terrain: long clauses for water glide, staccato for cliff-top. Information density is high—single sentences fold scent, object, and emotional state. No paraphrase loops; only one near-miss—“the ridgeway will guide you / the ridgeway twisted”—but varied verbs rescue it. Metaphors stay physical and coherent; no mixed vehicles or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>The star-stamp ticket punch as transferable sigil is a fresh inflection on the “object absorbs meaning” trope. Ferryman-aging risks fairy-tale convenience, yet the lyric frame absorbs it without genre whiplash. Mist-traverse as internal quest is familiar, but specificity of salt-air dusk and hull-scars grounds it. synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though not wildly risky.</comment>
