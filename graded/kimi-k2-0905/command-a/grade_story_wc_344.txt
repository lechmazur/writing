<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s want to “learn the rhythm of repair” is stated early and re-appears in the final line, but interiority stays generic (“heart pounded,” “hands trembled”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the hall-of-mirrors epiphany is summarized rather than shown forcing a micro-choice with cost. The earned stasis moment feels lightly grazed, not paid for by a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gears hum, the ticking swells, and Elara’s stance is re-configured with conceptual cost (“weight of her purpose clearer”). Causality is linear—prophecy symbols → door → hall → gears → insight—so the lens is cleanly Causal; however, the mirror-vortex threat is announced but never actually endangers or forecloses an option, so the cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The frozen library is anchored early with multi-sensory cues (scent of parchment, frost on windows) and the micro-setting of the ink vial and ticking clock constrain her tactile attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the hall’s mirror geometry is sketched lightly but enough to orient. No environmental detail charges the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed by a whisker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake—acquire the gears to mend time—remains coherent. Pressure escalates once: mirrors reveal alternate selves, tightening the emotional risk of fragmentation. Yet the stakes never actually test failure or demand a trade-off; the gears are simply handed over and the vortex lets her leave. No visible price is exacted, so the beat feels informational rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “repair as self-recognition” emerges implicitly through mirror imagery and the final fusion of gears + heartbeat. No moral is stated; the idea stays open. Because the mirrors do not force a decision that costs her anything, the resonance is moderate—pleasing but not unforgettable.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice maintains consistent distance and lunar-locksmith diction (“lunar-eclipse locksmith,” “driftwood nostalgia”) without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, short bursts for discovery. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal cadence feels character-specific and stable under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold repeats (“she saw herself… she saw herself…”). Metaphors stay coherent (“air thick with… moonlight” risks mixing states but reads acceptably). No artifacts touch the closure beat, so the high-band cap is not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines clock-punk, prophecy scavenger hunt, and mirror-test tropes, but the synthesis feels fresh because the locksmith’s tool is literally her own temporal echo. The concept commits fully and ends at an image that could not swap out with another profession. Risk is moderate, not radical, keeping the piece just below the top tier.</comment>
