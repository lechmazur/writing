<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motives are clear—retrieve the chip fragments—but interiority is generic (“heart raced,” “mind racing”). The perpetually surprised trait is stated, never embodied; no contradiction or micro-choice shows it altering tactics. Closure’s “frequency of belonging” epiphany is told, not dramatized; cost is conceptual rather than felt. Character functions, yet lacks individuating detail or visible flaw that complicates action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: pilgrim whisper → Kael arrives → drone finds glow → three-piece scavenger hunt → hologram. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“frequency of belonging” reweights the quest—but cost is abstract; no persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics. Lens stays situational/accumulative; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory delivers tactile specificity: cracked stained-glass, dust-and-parchment air, spiral staircase that presses history downward. Star charts and astrolabes are noticed through Kael’s pilot-eye bias. Setting constrains movement (narrow alcove, corroded vault) and supplies the pedestal props. “Brilliant dimness” is repeated without evolving; still, the stones feel lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Stake—assemble the chip to decode “belonging”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete loss is risked. Escalation is spatial, not emotional: each piece is farther, not costlier. Agency is present (climb, pull, insert) yet never forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. Tightest beat is the drone glow discovery; after that, pattern loops without deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented identity vs cosmic connection is emergent but thin; the chip’s hologram literalizes “belonging” without prior subtext. No returning image shifts meaning; star trails remain map, not metaphor. Final insight is stated, not resonantly implied. Complexity is hinted, yet ends in tidy affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Kael’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is serviceable, occasionally rhythmic (“brilliant dimness” refrain). Diction stays within pilot lexicon except for one lapse—“perceptual signature” not shown. Voice lacks idiosyncratic texture; could swap names without change. No dialogue to test subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear, efficient, low-density; sentences do one job. Figurative language is sparse, safe. Minor scaffold: “the air smelled of dust and old parchment” + “dim light filtered” = adjacent sensory checklist. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final image is strong but unvaried diction. Clean copy; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fusion of ancient observatory + drone recon + type-matrix chip feels fresh, yet plot remains classic fetch-quest. “Frequency of belonging” offers conceptual lift, not narrative risk. No structural experiment; tropes are rearranged, not transformed. Specificity of setting and artifact keeps it above midline.</comment>
