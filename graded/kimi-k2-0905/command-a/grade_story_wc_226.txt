<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s “innocently mischievous” label is announced, not dramatized; the interiority is lyric, not contradictory. The closing renunciation (“I am the shattered mirror…”) is earned, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual lens is consistent, and the micro-choice to keep reciting under growing spire-light shows hierarchy of values. Hairline slip: diagnostic self-label at climax keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the path appears, cost is felt (she walks “alone, but unburdened”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each poetic fragment refracts the mist and reweights the stake. The 120-word anchor is met; canyon, spire, and ritual clock are legible. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—loss of the prior self—so 9.0 gate is cleared despite a fractional over-articulation of price.</comment>

<comment>Setting is not backdrop but pressure engine: bone towers swallow sound, mist thickens as she speaks, spire glow only when verbal shards accumulate. Tactile handling of stone and swirling vapor constrain pacing and posture. Final image of parted mist revealing a solitary path is micro-setting that crystallizes the reconfigured stake. One minor cadence of “towers of bone… canyon of endless echoes” edges toward template, not enough to ding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can forgiveness be refracted into bearable pieces?—tightens through each poetic iteration that visibly alters the environment. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. The meaningful deepening occurs when shadows of the wronged appear, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (heart-shard surrendered) but legible, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via refraction imagery rather than thesis: forgiveness as splintered mirror re-weights itself in the final line. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers brushing stone, mist bending—never in commentary. Ambiguity lingers: is the path freedom or exile? No moralizing paragraph, only image. The lyric return of “shattered mirror” supplies resonant reconfiguration, satisfying 9.0 minus a hair for slight overtone of maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-ceremonial, consistent with lone ritual performer; syntax lengthens then compresses as spire brightens. Perceptual signature—“whispering void,” “forged hush”—is character-appropriate, not decorative. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and rhythm-motivated. Rhythmic control peaks in final declarative line, crystallizing the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image advances atmosphere or pressure. No loops or synonym churn; “mist,” “echo,” “spire” recur with evolving function. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror metaphor, supplying pattern payoff. Occasional elevated diction (“refract,” “ethereal”) is justified by ritual frame; one strained participle phrase mid-text keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geology, optics, and oral poetry feels fresh; “impromptu poetry as technology of refraction” is non-obvious. Transformation test fails if swapped to prayer or song, proving specificity. Slight echo of Clarke-esque alien artifact, but subordinated to emotional arc. Risk in lyric abstraction is purposeful and paid off, earning +0.3 boldness bump within band.</comment>
