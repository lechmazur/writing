<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lira’s interiority is consistently rendered through bodily scars, micro-choice (pressing ring to threshold), and embodied cost (knees buckle, hollow ache). The severed scar-link is a visible forfeiture that forecloses a path, but the “tender” trait is asserted more than dramatized; one more beat showing her gentleness colliding with the need to wound would push this to 8+. Motive remains clear and scales to length.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ring cracks, a scar-link severs, and Lira assumes Charged Poise under starlight—cost is legible. Causal chain holds: darkness presses → scar-network feeds energy → ring pays price → threshold stabilizes. Accumulative lens is taught early (each scar as tether) and held to the final image. A micro-drag in mid-text—“she could feel it pressing… a suffocating presence”—slows the because/therefore momentum by a hair.</comment>

<comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary is more than backdrop: its starlit remnants dictate Lira’s lateral movement, supply the visual mirror for her glittering scars, and frame the final image. The doorknocker ring evolves from heirloom to spent tool—its cracked dullness is the closure’s visual cost. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sanctuary survival—tightens once when Lira severs her own scar-bridge to power the ring. The tightening is protagonist-driven and narrows her future options (she loses one soul-link). Cost is visible: ring cracks, scar gone, knees collapse. A second pressure beat (e.g., darkness adapting) would elevate to 8.5+ band, but single meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—teaching suffocation to breathe—emerges through image (shadows recede rather than vanquished) rather than thesis. Subtext lives in the cracked ring: salvation demands self-fracture. Final starlight reweights earlier “starlight filtered through ancient trees” into quiet endurance. Avoids explicit moral, but “loaded emptiness” is named rather than felt; one sensory echo of hollowness would lift resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is tactile—scars glimmer, ring hums, darkness “snakes.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during flare: “She gripped… pressed… collapsed.” Filter verbs minimal; one “she could feel” is acceptable. Voice texture distinct but could risk higher register than a lone guardian’s lexicon; “encroaching darkness” verges on literary template diction, holding this sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: opening lyrical cadence, clipped fragments at flare (“The sanctuary erupted…”), return to longer close. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight/remnants, scars/tethers. One near-mix: “suffocating presence” is abstract; replacing with concrete sensation (cold filament tightening lungs) would sharpen. Clean grammar, pronoun clarity, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Scar-link magic and ring-seal feel fresh because the cost is internalized—guardian loses part of her own body/memory. Synthesis of “teach suffocating to breathe” with self-sacrifice twist is non-obvious. Familiar dark-encroachment frame is reanimated through embodied tariff. Risk: lyric repetition of “ashen charcoal sanctuary” edges toward incantatory safety; one off-kilter detail (bitter resin scent of scorched trees) would heighten specificity.</comment>
