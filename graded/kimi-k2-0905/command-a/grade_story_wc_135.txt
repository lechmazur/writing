<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—doubt vs. conviction—stays live in-scene (grip tightening on valve, tremor on wood). The final acceptance is earned by prior discoveries and costs her the safety of scholarly detachment. Status shift with the gray-cloaked woman is legible but under-utilized; micro-choice hierarchy is clear yet not pushed to a second external pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: valve hum → note → woman appears → inheritance of role. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s “absences” are re-valued into fillable spaces. Cost is felt—she forfeits outsider safety and accepts an endless task. One transition (cliff ascent) is crisp; orientation anchored by word 84.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor’s half-buried hull, petrichor, and pooled-water glyphs constrain deciphering choices and charge the final image. The valve’s brass coolness and the carved wood fragment act as micro-settings that funnel attention. Weather residue affects footing and visibility, integrating with action rather than pausing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and sharpened when the valve awakens. One meaningful tightening: the note reconfigures isolation into vocation with visible price (lifelong summons). Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence (woman’s arrival) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “absences as potential archives” emerges through concrete salvage and sonic resurrection rather than assertion. Final image of harbor exhaling converts wreckage from memento mori to living register—an earned conceptual flip. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about the toll of endless compilation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual filter—salt-stung details, map-symbol recognition. Syntax grows clipped under discovery pressure, then widens during the resonant note. No head-hop; gray-cloaked woman’s dialogue stays external, preserving distance. Distinct maritime idiom: “ocean-spray archivist,” “petrichor,” “navigated absences.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene beats—long inhale of description, staccato finds, sustained final note. Metaphors stay physical (“harbor itself was responding”) and consistent; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers action, setting cue, and interior tilt. One soft loop: “weight a familiar comfort” ≈ “weight in her satchel” could compress, but does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reframes-archive trope via sonic archaeology—trumpet valve as resurrection tool rather than relic. “Navigated absences” concept treats lack as spatial territory, giving fresh geometry to loss. Specific detail—petrichor over salt, glyph-carved timber—anchors novelty in sensory fact. Risk taken in lyrical ellipsis (woman dissolving into mist) is prepared by earlier water-and-mist imagery, paying off without gimmick.</comment>
