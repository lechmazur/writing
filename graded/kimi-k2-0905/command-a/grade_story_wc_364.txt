<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli’s “quiet determination” is stated repeatedly but never embodied in contradiction or visible cost; every choice is smooth and unresisted. The stranger’s undefined otherworldliness undercuts the relationship-as-crucible beat, so the “barter” lands as abstract premise, not pressured trade. No micro-choice shows him weighing what “his awakening” actually costs; the interior monologue stays safely summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure is present—planet healed, Eli “undeniably changed”—but the causality is soft: weaving silk into runes acts like a magic switch rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative, yet the final image reweights little because the price of Eli’s “awakening” is never specified; the story tells us he paid without showing the cost. Orientation is clear by 120 words, no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The floating rock arches and fruit-metal air are vivid and specific; they create an off-world texture without catalogue overload. Spatial choreography stays clean across the descent, and the forge smells anchor POV bias. None of these details actively constrain Eli’s choices or charge the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—planet renewal—signals early and tightens once when Eli commits, but the tightening is declarative (“I’ll do it”) rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture. Escalation is linear descent, not reversible pressure; no live option is closed until the off-stage explosion resolves everything. Cost is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-from-rubble emerges from imagery rather than thesis, but the final paragraph nudges toward moral summary (“he had forged a miracle”). The silk-runestone fusion hints at conceptual repricing, yet the conceptual cost to Eli stays opaque, blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays stable; sensory diction (“ripe fruit and molten metal”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative register occasionally drifts toward epic template (“a spark to reignite their dying spirit”), flattening the meek-blacksmith idiom, but pressure scenes keep syntax tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Clean clause variety and strong verbs; only light scaffold (“his resolve quiet but unyielding” repeated in new wrappers). No mixed metaphors or loops that obscure causality. Final lava chamber could use sharper sensory compression under heat stress, but momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Silk-as-planetary-IV is a fresh twist on eco-fantasy; orchard planet and rock arches feel specific, not stock. Yet the stranger, barter, and “awakening” remain archetypal ciphers, so the fusion is only half-transformed. Still, the fruit-forge smell crosses senses in a memorable way.</comment>
