<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—Elara’s motivations (nephew guilt, lost-time obsession) stay legible and consistent. Yet the emotional shifts—guilt → perplexity → tearful acceptance—are declared more than dramatized; we’re told “eyes filled with tears” rather than shown bodily friction under pressure. Single POV keeps choreography simple, but no second character means the “relationships as crucible” bullet is waived. The earned stasis (she will return with presence) lands, but the cost feels lightweight because the moment of choice is a gentle caress of a saucer, not a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft, credible CR: the saucer-crack is re-valued from wound to reminder, with clear conceptual cost—time is irreparably fractured. Causal chain is present: missed ritual → glade → card-pull → saucer-light → reframe. Reflection stays within 20% and is anchored to present objects; however, the orientation anchor (where, when) is slightly late (~130 words) and the glade’s spatial rules remain fantastically vague, so the Orientation Test nudges −0.3. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—images accrete until the cadence shift of glowing crack; pattern is maintained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Midnight glade above clouds” is atmospherically vivid—crystalline leaves, moon-filtered light—yet functions mostly as postcard beauty rather than tactical constraint. Micro-setting substitute: the cracked saucer works better, guiding her hand and final stance. Sensory breadth (visual, haptic) is balanced, but no environmental obstacle alters her tactics; setting never pushes back. Early anchor arrives just past the 120-word margin, triggering a −0.3 carry-over from Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled early and personal. Pressure tightens once: the glowing crack reveals missed moments, narrowing her option set from search to acceptance. No visible external price is paid (no injury, no exile); cost is purely internal, so escalation feels moderate, not acute. Under Accumulative lens, the single cadence shift suffices, but it peaks at emotional recognition rather than irreversible loss, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—time’s fragility and the ethics of presence—emerges through the saucer image rather than authorial statement. Subtext is modest; symbolism of cracked porcelain is clear but not over-articulated. The final reconfiguration (flaw → reminder) invites reader reflection without moralizing, satisfying the “non-literal answer” test. Ambiguity lingers: does she really re-enter family life changed? Cost is implied, not demonstrated, so resonance stays moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays stable; perceptual signature leans poetic—filament phrases like “shimmered with the weight of forgotten dreams” establish texture. Syntax is rhythmically varied, but occasional elevated diction (“choking beauty,” “kaleidoscope of what could have been”) edges toward literary template; not quite ventriloqued through Elara’s idiom. Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulation under pressure is present but mild—no compressed diction or syntactic fragmentation when the saucer ignites.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally fluid; sentences open with variety. Figurative language is dense—sometimes every sentence carries a metaphor—yet the pattern is established early and supports the lyric mode, so −0.3 rather than full penalty. Occasional mixed metaphors (“beauty tightening like a noose” beside “sand through clenched fists”) create minor muddle, but not at closure. A few filter verbs (“she realized,” “she saw”) could be cut for immediacy; scaffolding is light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—cloudbound midnight therapy-session with Tarot and doll china—feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy templates. The saucer-crack as map of lost time is an inventive re-inflection of the “broken heirloom” trope. Specificity (onyx-ink cards, hand-tracing cloth custom) grounds the concept in lived detail. Emotional angle (aunt guilt, not grand destiny) personalizes the arc; risk is moderate, coherence high.</comment>
