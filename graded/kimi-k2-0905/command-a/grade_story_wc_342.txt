<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her face-blindness and fractal perception filter every observation, never told, always shown through tactile detail. The single contradiction—seeking an unnamed “something” yet executing a flawless plan—remains unexamined, blunting potential depth. No second character means relationships/status bullets are waived; the obsession is credible but static, so the arc is more confirmation than transformation. The earned cost is the building’s collapse, felt externally; her internal limit stays untested, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hush → fractal detail → sky-in-book is taught early and lands with Charged Poise: “the stillness was no longer oppressive…boundless possibility.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. One seamless scene, one meaningful tightening when the book safe is opened, re-weighting stakes from “find” to “contain infinite.” Building demolition supplies external cost, but no persistent constraint or price shapes Elara’s next move, keeping it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hollowed oak functions as micro-setting: its carved shelves and shifting patterns physically guide her fingers to the safe, so environment constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—texture of bark, weight of book—never tourist catalog. Condemned-building hush returns in final line, recharging the opening image; this satisfies the 9+ gate. One whiff of plaster crack repeats without evolution, a minor missed opportunity, but the tree-as-library remains specific and causally active throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to mirror the sky inside walls”—is declared early; pressure tightens when blank pages resist her fractal reading. Escalation is textural: each star impression adds density until the constellation is internalized; no external antagonist or reversal needed. Cost is the building’s final shudder, felt rather than negotiated; no tactical loss (tool, time, social credit) alters her method. Sufficient for 7-band but lacks a visible price that forecloses a future path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the infinite cannot be owned, only momentarily contained; the blank pages’ latent constellations embody this. No moralizing—final line offers Charged Poise rather than thesis. Recurring hush and fractal imagery shift from menace to promise, reweighting the premise. The concept of limits stays conceptual rather than moral, inviting reflection without tidy answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; diction (“fractally precise,” “seep into the very bones”) matches Elara’s hyper-detailed perception. Rhythm clusters short clauses under pressure, then elongates during craft; no template cadence. No dialogue, so only internal voice is judged—consistent, faintly archaic, scholar-guild diction sustained. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to” ×3) keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear varies rhythm; sentences open with participle, noun, preposition in deliberate rotation. Information density high—“her fingers traced the rough bark…vein in a leaf, every crack”—three sensory jobs in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay sky-bound and coherent. One mixed moment: “mirror the sky inside walls” risks abstraction, but the image is immediately grounded in blank-page indentations, so clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Face-blind artist + fractal sight + tree-library is a fresh synthesis; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. “Sky inside walls” risks grandeur but is literalized through star-indentations on paper, avoiding pseudo-profundity. No close echoes of famous scenes; guild lore is lightly sketched yet specific. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending in collapsing building—but coherence remains, earning upper 7-band.</comment>
