<comment>Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—“faith shattered,” “sense of belonging”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that shows her risking anything tangible. The only concrete decision is placing the sundial base, yet the text summarizes weeks of digging rather than dramatizing a single moment where her curiosity collides with fear or doubt. Warm curiosity is asserted, never tested against a live obstacle that would force her to pay or renounce. The arc lands in emotional summary, not earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural re-weights Elara’s exile into cyclical continuity, cost felt in the phrase “she had come here broken.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed shard thickens texture until the final image crystallizes meaning. However, the middle compresses time into montage (“days turned into weeks”), skipping beats where the land could have refused or punished her, softening pressure. Orientation is clear by 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and tactile: roots “snaked between ancient bones like veins,” boots sink, slab edges are finger-smooth. The setting actively guides Elara’s route and supplies the sundial seat that unlocks the tomb, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; smell/taste of earth or rot is missing, but economy favors the image that charges closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the slab maneuver.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—is declared early but remains abstract; no external obstacle endangers the dig or her claim to the site, so pressure stays internal and diffuse. The only tightening is the moment the hollow is noticed; coincidence (roots “seemed to shift”) rather than a hard choice escalates tension. Cost is retrospective (“she had come here broken”) rather than a price paid inside the scene. Agency is observational wandering, not tactical risk.</comment>

<comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges organically from mural and sundial imagery rather than editorial statement. Subtext resides in the juxtaposition of bones and fruit, life and death, but the final paragraph still spells out the moral (“a reminder that even in the darkest times…”). The reweighting lands via image, yet the impulse to explain blunts resonance. Ambiguity is present but constrained by the reassuring tone.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: Elara notices via texture, pattern, celestial etchings. Syntax modulates from long breathy sentences to short pulses at discovery. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs appear but feel motivated by contemplative mode. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; occasional elevated phrases (“diaspora returnee,” “conceptual repricing”) feel like prompt residue yet do not rupture texture.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: each sentence advances image or emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored. Minor over-modification (“warmly curious,” “soft earth”) is tolerable at this length. Final third is free of artifacts; clarity at closure is intact. Strong verb choices (“snaked,” “sank,” “slid”) keep momentum.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is a fresh, macabre-twist on ancestral return; the sundial as key-and-bridge fuses tech, myth, and character restoration. Concept feels specific to this narrative, not a template overlay. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric excavation rather than thriller—but coherent. Emotional specificity avoids diaspora clichés yet stops short of exposing Elara to real peril, leaving a safe middle. Transformation test passes: swap setting or object and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
