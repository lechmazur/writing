<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—her body registers geode-coolness, static, dawn-light—as motive. Yet the arc is purely interior; no external test forces her to act, so “affectionate skeptic” remains asserted, not tried under fire. The cost is abstract (fatigue, hope) rather than a forfeiture we witness. Still, voice-specific perception keeps her individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn image crystallizes a reweighted premise—broken minds can be re-lit. Causal chain holds: shock → geode touch → devise ritual → light-map → charged hope. One transition (night→dawn) is legible; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Studio geography is sparse yet sufficient: LEDs, mirrors, geode on table—objects constrain camera angles and bodily movement. Light itself becomes micro-setting; its behavior (refraction, long-exposure trails) is specified beat-to-beat. The “ethereal hum” risks cliché, but tactile handling of tools keeps it lived-in. Final image re-uses environment to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal fractured telepathic links—arrives early and tightens once: she must finish the painting before dawn. No external opposition; pressure is self-imposed deadline and residual static unease. Escalation is accretive (light layers) rather than a reversal. Cost is felt fatigue, but no option is foreclosed—hence stops just below 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reparable connectivity emerges through image, not thesis: shattered geode ↔ severed thoughts; rewoven light threads ↔ healed minds. No moralizing sentence ruins the final moment. Conceptual reweighting is subtle but legible. Ambiguity lingers—can art really mend minds?—which invites reflection rather than closure-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Free-indirect voice stays close to Elara’s perceptual filters—“fractally precise edges,” “willowglass hope”—diction precise yet not purple. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for nocturnal sweep, clipped fragments when she positions gear. No dialogue, so no voice-drift. Patterned diction (“fractally precise” repeated) is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no scaffold loops; figurative language is selective (“swirling tapestry of blues and silvers”) and tied to camera optics. One mixed risk—“ethereal hum” borders filler—but density remains high: each sentence advances setup or emotional layering. Final line earns resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-pill recall as off-stage catalyst is fresh; using light-painting to map cognitive fracture reframes standard “artist heals world” trope. Geode’s muscovite sheets metaphor for mind-planes feels specific, not borrowed. Yet core plot—lonely artist makes symbolic art overnight—leans familiar; specificity of sensory process elevates it into memorable territory.</comment>
