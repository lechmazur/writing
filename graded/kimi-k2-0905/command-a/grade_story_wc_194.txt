<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motive is clear, but interiority drifts into inherited-obsession shorthand (“thick with… forgotten dreams”) rather than her own sensory present. The crank-handle is fondled repeatedly yet never resists or complicates her grip—object fails to pressure her. Grandfather’s voice over-explains her need, so the final “keeper” stance feels bequeathed, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is thin: turn crank → hallucinated bridge → receive journal; no intermediate obstacle or micro-choice that costs her anything. The journal’s reveal is pure gift, not consequence of her agency. Closure image (keeper by window) lands as Charged Poise, but because the lens is situational/psychic, the missing causal tightening is forgivable; still, the cost is only implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Sepia room anchors immediately; golden shadows, paper scent, and brass glint are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays clean as Eleanor crosses to the gramophone. The bridge vision is sketched with just enough sensory cue (wood planks, sky hues) to function as alternate setting without over-extension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hidden family truth—is declared early but never materially tested; no live risk, ticking clock, or resource lost. Escalation consists of atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options. The final “keeper” role reweights identity, but because the price is off-stage (burden of painful knowledge), pressure feels moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt versus individual agency emerges through sound-as-truth motif rather than overt statement. Silence and music recur, gaining moral weight without thematic exposition. Final image lets ambiguity linger: dynasty ends not with restoration but with witness—an earned, non-moralized resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent distance; vocabulary stays within Eleanor’s cultured but not academic lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments during vision. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal-only, yet perceptual signature (sound as tactile) remains particular and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, but “forgotten dreams,” “whispered secrets,” “weight of centuries” are familiar phrase clusters that blunt specificity. Several filter-verb stacks (“she felt the standing waves… she saw flashes… she heard whispers”) dull immediacy in the visionary climax. No loops obscure causality, yet metaphor density spikes in a short span without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sound-as-genetic-memory is a fresh angle on family-curse tale; standing-wave pseudoscience is kept metaphorical, avoiding expositional trap. Gothic inheritance tropes are intact but tilted through acoustic mysticism. Risk is moderate; specificity of gramophone mechanics and sepia palette keeps it from feeling template-derived.</comment>
