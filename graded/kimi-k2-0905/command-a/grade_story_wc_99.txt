<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias’s slow, deliberate interiority and gentle handling of compass/lace feel lived-in; the micro-choice to read each letter aloud is embodied. Yet the arc is almost passive—he drifts, follows, listens—so the renunciation of regret feels bestowed by setting rather than wrestled. No contradictory impulse collides with his urge to release, so the “earned” beat is soft. Interiority stays specific, but the lack of friction undercuts high-band impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: letters dissolve, compass stills, color released—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (compass, lace, tide-borne letters) accretes meaning until the final cadence reweights the stake. Early orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words) and the single transition (porch→cove) is legible. Minor slack: causal links are poetic rather than sharp; he “understands” rather than chooses, so the Decisive Change is gentle, not irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Islet, cottage, cove, tide-washed sand are sketched with salt-air specificity; weathered lace and half-submerged chest supply tactile micro-setting. Environment steers choice: slick rocks slow him, hidden cove reveals letters, rising tide literally erases regret—setting constrains and enables. Sensory hierarchy favors damp earth, salt, spinning needle—details filtered through bonsai-trained attention to minute change. Final image recharges the same shoreline, now re-colored by release, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—the unspoken apologies—is signaled early; pressure tightens only once: letters appear and are read aloud, their dissolution the single intensification. Agency is receptive—he follows rather than tests—so cost is observational, not tactical. Under Accumulative lens the tide’s erasure is a credible pattern-break, but the protagonist does not forfeit anything tangible; the price is emotional exposure, lightly felt. Enough for mid-7 band, but not the visible trade-off 8.8+ demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme of release emerges through the dissolving letters, not commentary; subtext lives in the compass needle’s stillness and lace’s silent instructions. The cerulean regret hue is never named aloud—image does the talking. Final image reweights premise: color is not found but let go, a Conceptual Repricing that feels inevitable. Minor sentimental halo around “healing sea” is the only softener.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s slow, tactile diction; perceptual signature is consistent—hears tide as “rhythmically placid,” sees lace as living bonsai. Syntax lengthens and breathes with his slow speech, then tightens on slippery rocks—rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs minimal and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and variegated; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (tides of remembrance, color of unspoken apologies) are coherent and paid off. Opening and closing sentences anchor voice and image. One mixed micro-image: “diffuse through him like a gentle breeze” edges toward abstraction, but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so only a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: bonsai tutor + ghost-ship compass + antique lace instructions is pleasantly non-obvious. Tides-as-memory is familiar, but here literalized by dissolving letters. Risk is moderate—lyric, reflective, nearly plotless—but coherence holds. Does not transform tropes deeply enough for 8.8+ originality, yet remains memorable.</comment>
