<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “idealistic map librarian” trait is shown through her cataloguing mindset and the map etched into the floor, but her interiority drifts toward generic awe (“heart quickened,” “spongey dread”) rather than profession-specific perception. The copper nail functions as a charged heirloom, but its emotional link to her great-uncle is told more than embodied. The final renunciation lands cleanly—she forfeits the nail’s power—yet the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Still, the single-POV interiority stays coherent and the ancestral motive drives every beat, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each journal stanza tightens the because-chain toward the ritual, and the exile reversal is paid for by relinquishing the nail. Orientation is secure inside 120 words (cliff station, shifted jet, personal quest). Closure is a clear CR: the sky calms and the journals “no longer cryptic,” reweighting history at conceptual cost. The only micro-slip: the stanza mechanic is revealed late, so the ritual feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Weather station is evoked through cracked glass domes, ozone scent, and the atmospheric map glowing underfoot—each detail double-duties as plot device. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves from corridor to map-floor. The station’s broken instruments mirror her internal disrepair without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (copper nail, map groove) directly constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore erased legacy or let it stay buried”—is signaled early and escalates through each decoded stanza. The tightening beat is the ritual choice: speak the name, release the exiles, accept that history will rewrite itself. Cost is conceptual (loss of secrecy, station awakened) rather than tangible; still legible under CR lens. No coincidence resolves the turn; agency remains Elara’s throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—history’s reversible erasure versus ethical remembrance—emerges through the journals’ coded stanzas and the final calm sky, never sermonized. The copper nail’s shift from key to relinquished object reweights the meaning of “honor.” Subtext lurks in the station’s groan: memory itself is weather that can turn. Final image of clear skies offers quiet, non-literal answer to the ancestral question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays latched to Elara’s perception; diction favors precise meteorological lexis (“barometers,” “jet stream”) without jargon drift. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under crackling light, longer reflective cadences afterward. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. Slight template echo: “trembled in her hand” appears twice; minor cadence repetition but not intrusive enough to cap high band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “glass domes cracked and fogged, as if the sky itself had wept” does three jobs (visual, foreshadow, theme) in twelve words. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tornado in reverse”—is fleeting and physically coherent. Line-level artifacts do not touch the closure beat; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing ancestral rescue with meteorological mysticism feels fresh; the reversible exile concept lifts the plot above standard haunting. Specificity of the atmospheric map etched in the floor keeps the twist grounded. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual rather than hard sf—but execution is confident. Could swap names/places with minor loss, so stops just short of 8+ distinction.</comment>
