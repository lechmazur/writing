<question>1</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s “calmly inventive” trait is shown twice—decoding the sundial and coolly triggering the cradle—but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized mid-beat. The silent-revolution motive is declared early yet never collides with a visible personal cost; she never hesitates or loses anything on-page. Thorne’s sudden hesitancy is convenient rather than motivated by prior cues, so the relationship crucible remains inert. Competence dominates struggle, keeping the arc closer to clever puzzle-solving than to a felt renunciation or earned stasis.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → cipher hunt → key → cradle → dawn. Orientation is clean by word 80; no penalty. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing—light now “warm, alive” and fort populace “stirred,” a visible social cost. Cost is collective rather than personal; Elara pays nothing tangible, so the price proof test is only half-met, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fort is sketched with selective sensory hits—“dying torches,” “faint shimmer of stars”—that serve Elara’s narrowed vigilance. The sundial functions as micro-setting: its unnatural angles guide her fingers and hide the compartment, so environment directly shapes choice. Spatial choreography stays clean through the Thorne confrontation. Luminous twilight never presses tactically after the opening, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“awaken the oppressed without bloodshed”—is clear early. One meaningful tightening: Thorne’s appearance compresses options from puzzle-solving to stand-off. Elara’s agency triggers the cradle, but the price is off-loaded onto the sleeping populace rather than her own flesh, blunting visceral cost. Escalation is coherent under causal lens yet stays intellectual; no live resource is forfeited on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of illumination-as-liberation emerges through the blackout-to-light arc without sermon. The cradle reweights “sparks” from weapon to beacon, a subtle Conceptual Repricing. Final phrase “winking hush” risks thematic echo, but its flirtatious secrecy fits the covert victory, so penalty is minor. Complexity is present—Thorne neither converts nor attacks—yet the populace remains faceless, limiting thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited hovers close to Elara; perceptual signature is observant, tactile, metrically calm—“her fingers brushed,” “angles shifted under her touch.” No head-hopping; Thorne’s interior is withheld. Diction stays within a guard’s lexicon; only “conceptually carved key” edges ornate but occurs in low-pressure exposition. Rhythm breathes with the beats; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; momentum remains steady. Information density is solid—each paragraph advances puzzle or tension. Minor scaffold: “the sundial was more than a timekeeper; it was a cipher” is immediate paraphrase, −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closing image “bronze quill holder glinting in the light” is crisp and recharges the mentor motif.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Revolution-by-sundial-cipher is a fresh synthesis of standard stealth-insurgency tropes. Details—bronze quill, cradle of sparks—are specific to this world, not generic fantasy furniture. Yet the populace awakening happens off-stage, a safe narrative choice that hedges risk. Transformation test: swap fort for city, quill for compass, and plot still functions, keeping originality in competent rather than striking territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: “vigilant lock sentinel” in line 1. Development: her vigilance spots Thorne and hides her breath against the wall. Closure: she slips back into shadows, vigilance intact. Cost is externalized; still, the trait drives two beats and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: quill holder at belt, line 2. Development: used to trace sundial angles, then its design matches the key etching. Closure: glints in new light, reweighted from mentor memento to emblem of awakened hope. Three beats, charged return, irreplaceable design match.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Concept shapes stakes—“ignite a silent revolution” is the declared goal. Middle: its activation ends blackout and changes light quality. Closure: populace stirs, confirming beacon-over-weapon redefinition. Social cost is felt; without it, victory is hollow.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Label appears twice; shown in puzzle-solving and calm rebuttal to Thorne. No contradictory impulse or trade-off is dramatized, so trait stays decorative. Still enables decisive tactics, keeping it above midpoint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Intrigue is the through-action: decoding blackout, deciphering sundial, covert activation. Each major turn hinges on her secret manipulations. Replacing intrigue with open assault would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Half-painted sundial introduced early; mechanics matter—angles reveal compartment, etchings match key. Final activation uses the same angles. Without this specific cipher method, the cradle stays locked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Luminous fort at twilight sets initial atmosphere and justifies torch reliance. After blackout ends, fort light quality shifts, reweighting the setting. Beyond mood, setting does not constrain tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Blackout creates urgency, hides her movements, and motivates cipher hunt. Its abrupt end marks the victory beat. Time is tracked—“twilight,” “flicker of dying torches”—keeping the clock alive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Revolution desire is stated early and echoed in Thorne confrontation. Elara stakes her safety on the attempt, a minor personal cost. Mass awakening is the closure proof; without this motive, the climax is mere puzzle-solving.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Winking hush” is named only in final paragraph, yet the entire piece maintains a conspiratorial whisper—covert moves, shared secret with reader. Tone modulates from eerie hush to triumphant wink without breaking voice.</comment>
