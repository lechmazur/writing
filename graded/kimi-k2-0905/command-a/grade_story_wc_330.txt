<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carpenter’s muteness is handled as texture rather than label, and the “interior contradiction” quick test is met when he pockets the fragment against his own rule of silence. Yet the final restoration beat is slightly too omniscient—his exact emotional micro-choice at the carousel apex is paraphrased (“heart full”) rather than embodied, so the cost feels generic. The halo acts as external catalyst, not flaw-driven mistake; hence the arc is poignant but not fully complicating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise image of restored carousel + halo pendant that reweights silence as generative. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern is taught by recurring “misting hush” and bells, paying off in final luminous hush. Minor causality bump: the oasis is discovered by literal wrong-turn coincidence without prior plant; luck complicates but does not resolve, so allowed under Situational pressure. The cost is conceptual (he now carries audible hope) yet still felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test for lens & cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory triangulation—rusted iron taste, chime pitch, halo warmth—keeps exposition lean and stakes tactile. The circus-train micro-setting (single carriage compartment turned greenhouse) literally constrains his path and supplies the carousel needing repair, so 9+ gate is met. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Occasional soft filler (“labyrinthine corridors”) is venial at this word count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence birth living art?—is signaled early and tightens once: he must either stay mute or sing to animate the horses. Escalation is situational pressure rather than causal chain; the oasis appears by wind-bell lure, not prior intent, so agency is reactive. Yet the final song is an active, costly stance crystallization, satisfying closure. Persistent constraint (pendant now sings against his chest) foreshadows future exposure, keeping stakes alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: silence as fertile void, art as resurrection of forgotten joy. The whispering gleam motif reweights from mysterious object to audible hope pendant—an earned conceptual re-pricing. Subtext in gestures—fingers brushing mane, pocketed warmth—carries more than exposition. One soft moral in final sentence caps the升幅, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays pinned to carpenter’s perceptual bias—wood grain, wind-bell pitch, pocket heat—without POV drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for discovery. No forced poetic diction; imagery grows from occupational detail (“wood into dreams”). Filter verbs minimal; the “misting hush” refrain is patterned compression, paid off in final glow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Metaphors mostly coherent, though “tapestry of forgotten dreams” edges purple. One paraphrase loop: “silence…possibility” restated in intro & end. No mixed vehicles in climax. Density high; scaffolding minimal. Copy clean beyond one typo (“升幅” in prior comment—ignore, not in source).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mute artisan + circus relic + regenerative halo is fresh, avoiding steampunk cliché. Oasis inside train feels novel yet logically seeded by humidity & neglect. Risk taken with lyrical causality rather than fight-or-flight stakes; coherence holds. Not quite transformative—swap halo for any muse-object and spine survives—but specificity of carousel carpentry grants memorable angle.</comment>
