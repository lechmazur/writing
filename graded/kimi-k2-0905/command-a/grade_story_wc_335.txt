<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—‘fingers trembled’, ‘breath shallow’—and her backward-walk tic is embodied early. The mentoring motive, however, is asserted rather than dramatized: no mentee appears, so the crucible is missing. The tea-leaf method shows micro-choice under pressure, but the climactic ‘quiet resolve’ feels unearned because no prior flaw or mistake is confronted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard-mirror shifts from prison to portal, cost felt in the softened shadow. Causal chain holds: annotation → leaf geometry → shadow lightens; ellipsis between beats is motivated. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of leaf images and library dust reweights stakes—and holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The library is not backdrop but tool: shelves groan, air smells of ‘aged paper and damp wood’, and these textures feed Elara’s tactile ritual of brewing oolong. Spatial choreography is clean—desk, shard-mirror, parchment, cup—no floating objects. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the tea-leaf-strewn parchment constrains her annotation technique and charges the final portal image. Light through cracked windows evolves with afternoon, tracking real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the reversible exile—signals early and tightens once: the shadow’s edges soften only after she commits words to parchment, foreclosing her prior neutrality. Cost is conceptual but legible: the mirror flips from ‘prison’ to ‘bridge’, stripping her of the safety of distance. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational, crystallized in her stance shift. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: exile/return is enacted by the shadow’s literal softening, not sermonized. The library’s hush and the crescent-moon leaf reappear with reweighted meaning, avoiding motif checklist. Final image offers quiet conceptual repricing—portal, not freedom sermon—leaving ambiguous whether exile is truly reversible. Subtextual tension between archivist’s control and shadow’s agency invites reflection without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter: ‘scent that both comforted and suffocated’ is character-specific, not tourist-catalog. Syntax mirrors her nervy precision—comma-rich, breathless clauses when shadow ‘presses her into the chair’. No head-hopping; tea-leaf lexicon stays within her scholarly register. Free-indirect slips are clean: ‘She knew that reversible exile was…a promise’ is tagged with her certainty, not narrator assertion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyrical sentences build density, then snap to shorter declaratives at the payoff. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is disciplined—‘steam curling like whispers’ serves atmosphere without purple drift. Minor filter verbs (‘she believed’) survive but do not cluster in peak beats; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tea-leaf geomancy + reversible exile in a cracked mirror is not a trope bundle seen before. The annotation method is particularized, not gimmick: crescent-moon leaf shapes the shadow’s release, making the concept inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet lyric instead of plotty reversal—pays off via resonant final image. Could edge higher if the mentoring motive had on-page friction; as is, originality is solid but not breathtaking.</comment>
