<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is palpable in embodied beats (hand on railing, touch dissolving crystal), but interiority drifts into label-speak (“her heartbreak had not been in vain”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The micro-choice to name each monster crystallizes her shift, yet the prior causal link between lost mortal and present ritual is asserted, not dramatized, softening the cost. Still, her occupation as reaper is more than costume: the scythe’s neglect and reclaimed purpose visibly externalize arc. Earned stasis lands because the final resolve carries the weight of the performed naming.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the named constellations re-weight her grief and re-open her vocation, cost felt in the now-heavy parchment. Accumulative lens holds: each whispered echo layers density until the naming beat reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when anchored by line 3. Causality is soft on why this atlas page answers her loss, but the pattern teaches early (“she had carried it ever since”) and pays off in the final image, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory is sketched with selective sensory strokes—creaking dome, starlight shards, rune-lit platform—each detail filtered through Elara’s mournful attention and used to enable the ritual. The atlas page itself becomes micro-setting, its monsters given tactile weight as they lift and dissolve. Space stays coherent: railing, platform, parchment tracked without drift. While no environmental detail later constrains tactics, the final image of etched names in air is charged by the setting’s prior silence, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover purpose after failing one soul—surfaces early and tightens through the accretion of whispered sacrifices. The single meaningful deepening occurs when naming the monsters crystallizes her stance; options narrow from wandering to re-engaged reaper. Cost is visible in the tremor she speaks through and the now-anchored atlas she must carry. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates twice, keeping the score below 8.5, but the final image forecloses despair, satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: naming the nameless converts private grief into shared memorial, reframing sacrifice as generative. Subtext resides in the unspoken parallel between unnamed monsters and the unspoken name of the lost mortal. Final constellations silently answer the thematic question—creation persists beyond loss—without moralizing. One near-theme-echo line (“echo of sacrifice was not just about loss…”) is cushioned by immediate imagistic payoff, avoiding full penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, modulating syntax from long reflective sentences to spare imperatives during ritual. Diction—“shards of light,” “spiraling upward”—remains within a reaper’s mythic register without purple drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices tactile cold, star order, monster anatomy, all filtered through bereaved attention, sustaining a textured lyric voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; only two adjacent sentences repeat “echo” without new pressure, a minor loop. Metaphors stay coherent—light as shattering glass, monsters as night shards—and serve the beat. No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Opening line anchors tone; final line (“ancient observatory… now held a new echo”) resolves with cadence lift, achieving propulsion without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reaper naming sea-monsters from a humming atlas page is fresh, yet the lost-mortal catalyst is familiar mythic fare. Specificity of the observatory ritual and crystallizing nomenclature transforms trope into memorable image. Risk is moderate: lyric accretion over plot reversals. While not ground-breaking, the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meriting upper-band score.</comment>
