<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs. homesick ache—are dramatized in her body (pendant grip, coiled stance) and crystallize in the renunciation that keeps both realms in peril; the cost is felt. Interiority slips once into “dimensionally homesick” label-speak, but recovers with sensorial cold seeping into pores. Secondary figure (keeper) supplies status pressure that forces her public refusal, tightening the crucible. Endurance earns credible stasis: she will stand sentinel between worlds, ache unhealed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pendant appears → summons keeper → presents bargain → Elara refuses, foreclosing return path. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with visible cost—“the pendant’s glow dimmed, its power dormant for now”—and the lens stays causal throughout. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Minor causality bump: keeper’s rule (“garden will fade”) asserted rather than demonstrated, but Elara’s choice accepts the risk, preserving linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen garden functions as micro-setting: cold constrains breath/pulse, mist re-shapes spatial footing, ice-encrusted foliage whispers alien syntax. Pendant serves as tactile object-anchor, warming in synchrony with heartbeat, charging final refusal image. Sensory selection obeys POV—Elara notices temperature, light refraction, cryptic plant murmurs—never tourist catalog. One spatial continuity slip: “distance” between Elara and keeper never tracked after approach, but mist reshaping silhouette sustains atmospheric coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library safety vs. return home—signaled in paragraph three and tightened when keeper prices the bargain. Escalation is single but meaningful: the return door opens at the cost of destroying her current anchor. Agency is renunciation rather than action, yet it forecloses the only evident escape, leaving her in perpetual ache. Cost is declared, not viscerally dramatized, keeping score just below 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through embodied particulars—cold mist in pores, pendant’s unstable glow—never abstract sermon. Final image of “sentinel of light and shadow” reweights earlier optics motif without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: pendant dimming = suppressed desire. One thematic echo: “make friends with uncertainty” is too explicit in motivation line; slight dip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person tight maintains consistent psychic distance; diction—“shards of obsidian,” “folded light”—stays within alien-librarian lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure: short clauses when keeper approaches. No head-hopping; keeper’s interior withheld appropriately. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue sparse but goal-driven, carries subtext of ownership and exile. Syntax mirrors feral alertness: clauses coil, then release in refusal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver temperature, mythic whisper, emotional valence. Metaphors stay coherent—light folding, mist reshaping silhouette. One paraphrase loop: “the garden was alive, though not in the way…” followed by near-restatement; minor −0.2. No scaffolding, no tense drift. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line cadence echoes opening mist, recharging motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—mystic artifact, guardian between worlds—are re-freshened through sensorial cold optics and refusal ending that accepts permanent ache. “Boundaries of light” concept is made tactile via pendant pulse rather than abstract portal. Risk taken: story ends in stasis, not triumph, aligning theme with form. Specific detail—crystalline foliage whispering alien grammar—prevents generic overlay. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
