<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Clara’s honest-child trait is anchored early and drives the final confrontation; her refusal to keep lying is embodied in the trembling hand-off of the ink pot. Father’s shift from irritation to tentative hand-hold is credible, but his interiority is only sketched—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in him, so the relationship crucible feels one-sided. Micro-choices (touching the pot, holding it out) are concrete and cost-earned. Still, the moment of paternal softness feels slightly convenient because his prior schemes stay off-page; we see only her pressure, not his.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara reweights the rule-set by naming honesty as non-negotiable, father’s hand offers an uncertain truce—cost is the loss of escape via asylum. Causal chain holds: ink-pot oddity → interior crack open → naming the lie → stalemate with felt future risk. Orientation is clean within 120 words. Minor slack: “political asylum” is declared stakes but never tested in a concrete obstacle beat; the tightening is emotional, not external, yet still sufficient under the Causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Prep-room is vividly sketched—formaldehyde, wax, marble table—yet every detail is filtered through Clara’s con-artist-warped lens, so the room feels alive. The ink pot functions as micro-setting: its cracked porcelain and impossible ripple constrain her to keep holding it, guiding the pivotal choice. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating bodies. Funeral-home tech never exceeds Clara’s believable notice. Setting does not charge the final image (pot is set down, room left), so falls short of 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find the mathematics of a fair trade” between honesty and survival—is signaled early and crystallizes when Clara refuses the asylum lie. Escalation is single but meaningful: holding the pot crystallizes her stance, foreclosing the escape option. Cost is legible: father’s tightened jaw and the uncertain hand-hold show the relationship now carries a future risk. No external antagonist or second reversal, but internal pressure suffices for this length.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: honesty as a non-negotiable “mathematics” is dramatized, not stated. Subtext lives in gesture—father’s hand, pot’s pulse—never in abstraction. Final image of walking out together offers quiet, ambiguous resonance: possible reconciliation or delayed implosion. No thematic echo line, no moral tag. Could be sharper if father’s con-tradeoffs had earlier specificity, but the refusal alone carries weight.</comment>

<comment>Close third clings to Clara’s perceptual signature—formaldehyde smell, wax gleam, ink ripple felt in mind. Syntax is clean, with rhythmic lift at crisis: short bursts (“She opened her mouth… Instead, she held”). Father’s dialogue is minimal but distinct: “Sense is overrated” carries subtext. No head-hop; distance stays tight. Filter verbs minimal, diction within a bright child’s range. Voice modulates under stress—good control.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or beat. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphor. “Ink liquefying rigid thinking” is the single lyrical reach, but it is pattern-taught by the ripple and paid off at climax, so allowed. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Minor tic: two “seemed to” filters could be cut, but they do not dull the final image.</comment>

<comment>Premise—con artist’s honest child in funeral prep room—feels fresh, and the ink pot as mind-loosener is an inventive speculative micro-device. Emotional specificity (truth as math) keeps it from gimmick. Father-daughter con duo is familiar, but the inversion of the child as ethical brake gives it new tilt. Risk is moderate; could have pushed further by showing one concrete con scheme collapsing. Overall, fresh enough for a competitive lit mag.</comment>
