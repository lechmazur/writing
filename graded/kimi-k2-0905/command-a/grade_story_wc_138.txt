<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elyr’s boredom is vivid early, but the interiority turns abstract (“aching void,” “monotonous cycle”) and the pivotal choice to seize the fragment is asserted rather than dramatized with contradictory impulse. The closing shift from void to “spark of purpose” is declared, not embodied; no micro-cost is shown on the page. Still, the immortal fatigue is specific enough to keep him from cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—boredom → find fragment → experiment → shatter → new purpose—but the fragment’s rules and the spatial-mutiny stakes are retroactively explained rather than foreshadowed, so the climax feels convenient. Closure lands as Charged Poise (“spark of purpose” image) with conceptual cost, satisfying the lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The prismatic escondite is rendered through kinetic, sensory filters (“light fractured,” “crystalline ledge,” “colors twisted into chaotic patterns”) that evolve with the action. Micro-setting—the fragment warming in his palm—grounds one pivotal beat. While the world rules remain impressionistic, the environment actively resists and responds to Elyr’s manipulation, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he feel anything again?—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment’s hum offers the first tug of curiosity. The mid-scene escalation (storm energy channeled, dimensions mutiny) is visually strong, but the beat is narrated summary, not a choice point with visible trade-off; thus the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Still, agency drives the final rupture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of immortal ennui versus the peril of new sensation emerges through imagery rather than thesis. The closing “spark of purpose” reweights the opening void without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—purpose may be delusion—creating plausible counter-reading. No motif is forced; prismatic light and magnetic hum recur naturally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice maintains a distant, ageless cadence that suits an immortal observer: long vowel clusters, measured syntax, occasional archaic diction (“escondite,” “eons”). Under storm pressure the rhythm fragments—short clauses, present participles—mirroring dimensional shear without losing coherence. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: strong verbs (“shudder,” “fractured,” “reeled”) and selective adjectives. One paraphrase loop (“colors around him flickering like a dying flame… prismatic colors twisted into chaotic patterns”) costs −0.2. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Immortal boredom + prismatic dimension + magnetic field manipulation yields a fresh composite; the spatial-mutiny concept avoids typical portal-collapse cliché by treating physics as sensual experience. Risk lies in the impressionistic world rules, but the piece commits fully. Transformation test passes: swap names and the texture collapses.</comment>
