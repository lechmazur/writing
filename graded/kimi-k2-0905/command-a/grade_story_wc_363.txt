<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but thin; “wistful” is stated not shown, and her only micro-choice—stepping onto the light-bridge—lacks prior contradictory impulse. The bead’s glow tracks growth yet never forces a trade-off; sacrifice is asserted, not dramatized in body or deed. She remains a type rather than an individual voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge reconfigures silence from unraveling to weaving with legible cost—“the weight of her sacrifice.” Causality is lyrical-accumulative; each puzzle shard deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns, coherent under inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bamboo-filtered light, singing trees, and backward streams create a consistent lyric world; the amber bead serves as micro-setting that charges the final bridge image. Spatial track stays clean across the orchard trek. Environment never actively constrains choice, capping at 8.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“carry a message across impossible distance”—is signaled early and reweighted when silence becomes connective tissue. Single tightening beat: placing the final puzzle piece forecloses retreat and crystallizes the bridge. Cost is felt but not visibly extracted from Elara’s body/tool, keeping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-silence emerges via image pattern rather than statement; the final bridge offers resonant non-literal answer. No final-paragraph moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about what the message is, but that serves the mysterious premise rather than confusing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“liquid gold,” “raveling silence”) is consistent, rhythm modulates with cadence of weaving. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature is present but not pushed to razor specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, loop-free, with high image density; occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet so profound it seemed to unravel the very fabric of time”) flirt with overwriting yet stay purposeful. No scaffolds or mixed metaphors obstruct closure. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, propelling the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Weaving silence into a navigable bridge feels fresh; puzzle-map guiding through living orchard scenes transforms familiar quest trope. Conceptual risk is moderate—lyric fabulism rather than structural experimentation—but execution is coherent and memorable.</comment>
