<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s yearning to “bridge the gaps between people” is vivid, but the borrowed-personality trait stays ornamental; it never complicates or enables the halo experiment. Interiority is lyrically rendered yet drifts toward explanatory paraphrase (“it was as if…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climax—accepting overloaded empathy—rings true because the fragment has been tactile throughout, but the absence of a micro-choice that *costs* him something concrete (time, identity shard, a relationship) keeps the arc just short of earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elias sets the fragment down, now dimmer, internal chorus integrated, stasis earned at visible price—he is “changed…in a way that resonated deep within his core.” Causal lens holds: each beat (touch→flood→retreat→acceptance) is triggered by the prior, narrowing options until endurance is the only path. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~60 words; who/where/when never waver. Minor slack: “mathematics of emotion” is declared twice but never operationalized as a rule that shapes tactics; still, the image of fragment-as-mirror recharges the opening, satisfying CR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Workshop is sketched with selective sensory economy—ink smell, metal type trays, open ceiling—each detail filtered through Elias’s tactile craft. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting: its glow and pulse constrain distance, force retreat, then acceptance. Stars fading supplies a living clock that dovetails with internal dimming at closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent; bodies/props never teleport. Environment never over-described; every noun earns its keep by mirroring or pressuring the empathy experiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias survive the fragment’s empathy flood without losing self?—is signaled early and tightened once: retreat/grounding fails, leaving endurance as sole option. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse ups saturation until “tapestry” becomes unbearable. Cost is felt (ragged breath, floor collapse) but remains internal; no external resource is forfeited, so price is legible yet not persistent. Agency stays interior—no outward decision beyond “set fragment down”—which fits lyric mode but caps intensity just under 8-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy as expansion, not erasure of boundaries. The fragment’s dimming final image reweights the premise—connection extracts a toll from the conduit. No moralizing; insight is crystallized in the gesture of release. Particulars (letterpress, borrowed personalities) circulate as motifs but only “borrowed voices→chorus” actively reconfigures meaning, satisfying the two-feature standard. Ambiguity lingers—did Elias win or merely survive—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, lyrical, syntactically varied; perceptual signature fixates on light, texture, pulse. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register tilts slightly academic (“transposed empathy,” “mathematics of emotion”) but stays within obsessive craftsperson lexicon. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences in calm, fragments at surge—without algorithmic pattern. No head-hop or filter-verb clusters; interior texture remains coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, largely loop-free; only minor paraphrase echo (“changed…in a way that resonated”) could compress. Metaphors stay consistent (tapestry, vessel, chorus) and physically plausible. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No scaffold, purple lists, or strained simultaneity. Final third remains artifact-free, satisfying 9+ hygiene; minor lyrical repetition is purposeful, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress + empathic astrophysics artifact + identity tourism; none feel grafted. Halo fragment as emotional slide-rule is non-obvious yet inevitable once ink/type metaphors prepare the ground. Risk-taking—lyric interior, single-scene pressure, no external antagonist—heightens intimacy without gimmickry. Could swap names, but craft specifics (ink smell, type trays, borrowed voices merging into chorus) lock the concept to this setting. Quiet ending reconfigures premise rather than retreating to safety.</comment>
