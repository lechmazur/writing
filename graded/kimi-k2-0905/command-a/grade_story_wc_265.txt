<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eamon’s interior contradiction—thirst for insight vs. disorientation—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice under pressure until the socket insertion. The gear-slot moment crystallizes his role, but prior wandering reads as label-driven “philosopher” rather than specific hunger altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard layers sensory density until the machine-light reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the rainforest=reverie equation lands with conceptual cost—“he was its explorer, its guardian” forecloses safe return. Transitions are legible via sleep-jumps taught early; orientation anchor satisfies mosaic track.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is lived-in: uphill streams, cog-leaves, heartbeat-synced blooms all filter through Eamon’s body and attention. The small gear functions as micro-setting that finally slots into the dormant machine, charging the last image. Spatial choreography clean across translocations; no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will insight come?”—signaled early; tightening occurs when gear vibration redirects wander to purposive search. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: he forfeits exit, embracing guardianship. Agency present but soft; machine activation is more discovery than decision, limiting escalation bandwidth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of mind-as-wilderness emerges organically from accumulative imagery rather than thesis. Final equivalence “rainforest = metaphor for the mind” risks overt statement, yet the luminous machine-light reconfigures it as earned vision. Ambiguity lingers: insight roars, yet path remains unmapped—inviting reflection without moral tag.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature skews toward auditory metaphysics—“whispers of the rainforest,” “symphony of ideas”—without head-hop. Syntax flexes with cadence of wind-song; no filter-verb stacks. Diction slightly over-elevates (“conceptual systems governed this world”) but remains internally consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose breathes with scene needs; parallax of metallic vines vs. heartbeat blooms keeps density high. One scaffold loop: “for all its beauty… a void where insight should have been” is restated in adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors; final paragraph tightens into resonant cadence. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest + stray philosopher is fresh synthesis; concept follows implications without retreat. Risk taken in sleep-translocation mosaic pays off in closure image. Gear-as-key avoids trite McGuffin by retro-charging earlier relic. Could edge higher if insight mechanics violated expectation more sharply.</comment>
