<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—braiding voices into harmony—stays legible, but her interiority leans on abstract labels (“expectantly resigned”) rather than embodied contradiction. The rosette acts as a tactile anchor, yet her only micro-choice is the decision to “subtract noise,” which is stated, not dramatized through stakes or visible trade-off. Students stay generic, so status/relationship pressure is absent. Closure works as Charged Poise (choir swells, silence replaced), but cost is collective, not personal; she pays no individual price, so the arc feels gentle rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “subtract noise” strategy → humming ritual → audience silence reconfigured. Orientation clean (who/where/when by line 3). Single scene, one tightening midpoint when hums lock; library transmuted into “living cathedral” is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—arts reclaimed in neglected space. No persistent personal price for Elara keeps it from 9-band, but closure lands cleanly under causal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Velvet library, stained-glass autumn light, rosette glint are selective, sensory, and filter through Elara’s musical attention. Space actively guides ritual: central table becomes altar, acoustics reshape atmosphere. Micro-setting (rosette) constrains tactic—she circles the hum around it. Spatial choreography tight; no floating props or anchor drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing vanishing arts—signaled early; pressure tightens when audience silence becomes the test. Escalation is ritual, not obstacle: each rehearsal deepens pattern; final performance is first public exposure. Cost is communal (library reborn), not personal; Elara’s own options don’t narrow, keeping it from 8.8+. Agency resides in her decision to “subtract,” but no tangible loss (students quit? job cut?) is risked or paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—harmony through subtraction—emerges via ritual, never sermonized. Rosette’s glow reweights meaning at closure, offering non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will the wider world listen tomorrow? No tidy moral, but final applause risks feel-good symmetry that slightly blunts edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, music-inflected diction suits choir-teacher POV; sentence rhythm modulates from languid description to breath-matched hum phrases. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (light like “trapped melody”) stay within musical lexicon. Minor cadence repetition in “once…now” constructions, not enough to stall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary; openers avoid template. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language kept spare; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned,” “traveled stillness”) feels slightly writerly rather than lived-in, but does not obscure causality. Closure line clean, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle: quiet subtraction as resistance to cultural erosion. Rosette repurposed from museum relic to active tuning fork is elegant turn. Risk is low—stakes stay safe inside library walls; no external institutional pushback appears, so concept never fully tested. Specificity of musicology lends authenticity, but premise could transplant to any endangered art form without structural change.</comment>
