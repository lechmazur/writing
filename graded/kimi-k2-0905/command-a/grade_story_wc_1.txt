<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s “steadily adaptive” trait is dramatized twice—she chooses to read frost as text and later to turn artist-knowledge into rescue tactics—so interiority links to visible micro-choices. Emotions stay body-level (“breath visible,” “fingers tracing”) rather than label-speak. The apprentice is missing, so relationship crucible is off-page; still, the choice to act rather than retreat is earned and carries felt cost at the kiln-grotto beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: ledger reveals apprentice alive and guild scheme, Elara crystallizes her next move, cost is the scorched kiln as evidence of mortal risk. Causal lens holds: because she decodes frost → therefore finds caches → therefore reaches kiln → therefore gains knowledge that reframes stakes. One shard transition (campfire → morning → night) is legible via frost/ledger pattern. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark.</comment>

<comment>Canyon is not postcard backdrop: frost patterns literally guide her path, bioluminescent grotto provides night-level visibility for kiln discovery, scorch marks echo earlier ambush. Spatial choreography clean: campfire → canyon floor → hidden grotto, distances tracked via ledger clues. Sensory selection favors touch/vision (icy ridges, glass shards) aligned with glass-artist POV. Micro-setting (ledger strip) constrains next move and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—apprentice’s fate—signaled in para 1, tightens when ledger pages imply alive/captive. Escalation delivered through her decoding agency: frost → caches → grotto kiln. Each step narrows options and raises physical risk (exposed in canyon, night approaching). Cost is visible: ruined workshop behind her, scorched kiln ahead, time lost. No coincidence resolves; discovery is payoff of her adaptive method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reframing “fragments” (glass shards, frost cracks, ledger scraps) into usable pattern—art as survival. No overt thesis; final image of starlight on glass reweights earlier motif of captured light. Ambiguity remains: she will weaponize same art that made her a target. Moral calculus implicit rather than stated. Resonance solid, but lacks one deeper irony or social cost to enter 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent glass-artist perceptual signature: noticing refracted light, reading texture, valuing translucence. Diction (“luminous,” “kiln,” “frost-patterns”) precise to vocation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure: short verbless fragments (“Here, she found the final piece…”) mimic breathless find. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, clipped for discovery beats. Dialogue absent by design; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional charge (“her fingers tracing the icy designs, her mind piecing together…”). No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (frost = ledger ink, canyon = silence that hums). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. One tiny register lift—“discover purpose in the pauses”—but rescued by immediate sensory follow-through.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Frost-as-cipher for smuggler’s trail feels fresh and particular; combines forensic detail with lyric imagery. Premise of glass-artist-turned-tracker via environmental micro-clues is non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test passes: switch to generic potter or painter would break frost-reading method. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than set-piece fight, but coherence never wobbles. Could push further by letting kiln damage her hands to cement cost.</comment>
