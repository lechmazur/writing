<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is mostly lyrical summary (“her gaze fixed,” “she felt a softly commanding pull”) rather than embodied contradiction; her single on-page micro-choice—vowing to restore balance—arrives in the last paragraph without prior dramatized tension or visible cost, so the turn feels announced, not earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is present (dreams → climb → revelation → vow) but compressed into scenic summary; the decisive change lands as a declarative vow, not a charged image or action, so the closure unit carries only conceptual cost; “softly commanding voice” interior monologue is the closest we get to a micro-turn, and it is still expository.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory triangulation—ember glow against twilight, metallic scent, pulsing crystal walls—anchors the ridge/grotto environment; the grotto’s temperature and pulse physically restrict her pace, so the setting alters tactics; fireflies and starlight reappear at closure to reweight stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Early stake (unravel dream) is clear; pressure tightens only via ominous atmosphere rather than narrowing options; the starlight-entity’s revelation is a single beat that flips her goal but does not test or foreclose an alternative path, so escalation is present yet lightweight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of ecological atonement emerges through starlight-as-lifeblood metaphor; the image of bleeding starlight reconfigured as duty supplies resonant non-verbal answer; no overt moralizing, but the epiphany is voiced to the reader rather than dramatized through a costly act, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at moderate psychic distance; clause rhythm mimics breath (“shared exhale”) and sustains fairy-tale cadence; diction stays within poetic-romantic register without purple drift; no dialogue, so voice coherence rests on repeated soft adjectives (“softly commanding,” “lacy menace”) that verge on template but hold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and image density; occasional modifier stacks (“jagged archway…lacy menace”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall propulsion; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph recycles “fireflies of summer” verbatim—minor artifact yet does not touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Familiar “monarch confronts cosmic wound” arc, but starlight-as-blood ecosystem and firefly echo give localized freshness; transformational check fails—plot could transplant to a worried scientist without structural change; risk level moderate, not bold.</comment>
