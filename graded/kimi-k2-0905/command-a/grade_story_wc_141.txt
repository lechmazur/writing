<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—myth-buster training vs. hunger for the ineffable—anchors every micro-choice; the final renunciation of “solving” for “living the riddle” is foreshadowed by her instinctive bow speed-up. Embodied emotion is precise: fingers brushing cracked shell, breath catching as room tilts. The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“she realized that her quest had never been about finding an answer”—that momentarily ventriloquizes the theme instead of letting the cello’s dying note do it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass rule-set flips from artifact to stance, cost felt in the bittersweet smile and live silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return—wind through dome, shell glow, cello hum—adds density until the final cadence reweights impermanence as power. The persistent constraint (“myth buster” tools useless here) shapes tactics and is paid in the forfeiture of proof. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory cracks, cliff salt, and cello wood are not backdrop but pressure sources: the half-finished cello literally provides the resonance that triggers the shift. Shell-glow and tilting room charge the final image; environment forces the stance crystallization. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tight—Mara notices moss streaks because they map time, not scenery. Spatial choreography survives the single-scene tilt with no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the ephemeral compass”—tightens when empirical tools fail and the only forward path is surrender to impermanence. One meaningful deepening: shell glow + room tilt = irreversible knowledge that the compass is lived, not solved. Cost is visceral: she forfeits her professional identity’s core method. Agency is continuous; every bow stroke is an attempt that progressively discards the old paradigm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without once naming “impermanence”: the shell’s shifting sunset hues and the cello’s dying hum reweight the concept in the final silence. Subtext carries in gesture—hand brushing unfinished wood, smile “bittersweet”—never in exposition. The riddle’s answer is shown as lived stance, not told. No moralizing; the last line’s “whisper of closing pages” is image, not lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: “faint scent of old wood” is noticed because it might carry memory, not for atmospherics. Diction—“salt tang,” “cracked dome,” “resonant hum”—is precise and cello-specific. Rhythm mirrors breath: longer clauses during search, short fragments at tilt moment. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy intact. One tiny register lift—“conceptual compass”—is grandfather-voiced and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either sensory data or causal pressure. High density: “wind howled through cracked dome” does weather, smell, and emotional tone in nine words. Metaphors are clean—no mixed vehicles—e.g., cello as “voice of the universe” is grandfather metaphor, not authorial flourish. Final image “whisper of closing pages” is crisp, echoing both book-ending and life-ending without overwriting.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>The “myth buster vs. myth embracer” arc feels fresh because the victory condition is inverted: success is surrendering the need for proof. Cello-as-ephemeral-interface is an original instrument, not a standard metaphysical prop. Grandfather’s gloomy cheer is delivered posthumously, avoiding wise-eld cliché. Specificity—unfinished cello, painted shell, cliff observatory—anchors the universal in the unrepeatable.</question>
