<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and creative drive are credibly sketched, but the interiority stays at a generalized “puzzle-solver” register; we never feel a private contradiction or visceral fear. The final step into the chamber is decisive yet cost-free—no visible stakes or flaw-induced mistake foreclosed—so the arc flirts with tidy competence rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the key’s burial opens the bank-door and the archive of future seeds, a literal Decisive Change with conceptual cost—his haven is now an endless assignment. Causal chain holds: smudged envelope → seed → key → door, each because/therefore legible; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation complete by line 5; micro-turn at seed-splitting tightens options effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moonlit brook, richest soil, storm-born silence—selective sensory triad anchors mood without checklist overload. The haven remains a bit generic (“space for innovation”)—no tactile fixtures, lock-puzzles, or scent of cedar to make the soil feel lived-in. Final chamber uses minimalist “artifacts” line, leaving the image charged but spatially blank; still, weather and water guide the key-drop choice, satisfying micro-setting rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard whatever this seed represents”—is declared early and escalates when key-glow pulls him to water, foreclosing the option to keep the object above ground. Cost is present but lightweight: a warm key and a creaking door; no credible loss (time, reputation, safety) is dramatized. Agency is continuous—planting, studying, relinquishing—so escalation passes causal test, yet pressure never becomes visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-obligation emerges implicitly through the accumulating seed-challenges; no thesis statement imposed. The final image—endless archive—reconfigures his creative sanctuary into an unasked relay race, a nice Conceptual Repricing. Subtext stays thin: no ironic gap between reader and Elias, and the corpse-flower’s real-world infamy (stench of decay) is left untapped for darker resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked on Elias with no head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”—a calm, analytical diction fitting puzzle-designer. Syntax is controlled, rhythms vary, no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“nocturnal haven,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authorial rather than character-bound, but never breaks lens; dialogue absent, so no voice-convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “seed split open… tiny, glowing key” carries spectacle without modifier overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elasticity in “orthogonal approaches” (repeated twice) and “storm-born silence” (three variants) but pattern is taught early and pays off in final silence, so allowed. Final third stays clean—no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mystery-seed-into-hidden-archive is a fresh twist on the “curator of puzzles” trope; corpse-flower seed adds exotic specificity. Conceptual turn—curator becomes curated—feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice avoids quirky ornament for its own sake. Risk is moderate but successful; could push further by exploiting the flower’s stench-of-decay symbolism for darker cost.</comment>
