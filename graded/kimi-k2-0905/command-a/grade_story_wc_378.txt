<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s caretaker-nostalgia is shown in tactile petal-touching, but the “inner static” is declared in abstract diagnostics rather than lived contradiction; her final detachment is visible, yet the turn feels mild because we never see her memories actually fray under pressure. Micro-choices (hovering hand, glowing protocol) do chart a hierarchy of values, but the emotional cost is more summarized than embodied. Still, a recognizable before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The box opening → miniaturization → emotional flattening chain delivers a clear Decisive Change with a felt price (nostalgia lost). Causality is tight: the magnetic-shift cue prompts the box, the box forces chaos-containment, containment drains memory. One causality bump: “strangely organic” is late-repeated without earlier anchoring, but it does not break the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass dome, pulsing wood, and roses are sketched with quick sensory hits; the dome’s magnetic shimmer is used to cue action, but no environmental detail actually constrains or charges the final image. Micro-setting (her glowing hands) is more active than the farm itself. Still, the dome stays coherent and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the farm and her own coherence”—is signaled early; the meaningful tightening is the box-opening that forecloses avoidance. Cost is visible: nostalgia is drained. Escalation is single-step rather than recursive, so pressure plateaus after the miniaturization beat, keeping it out of 8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. necessary amnesia emerges through the miniaturization conceit rather than exposition. The closing image of safe roses reweights earlier nostalgia as expendable, avoiding overt moralizing. Some lines edge toward thematic label-speak (“controlled burn escape”) but are embedded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tidy distance; diction stays within android lexicon (“miniaturization protocols,” “sensors detecting”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for rose reverie, clipped clauses during containment—without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or paraphrase stacks; metaphors are sparse and coherent. Occasional elevated register (“etched with symbols of forgotten terrors”) flirts with purple but stays purposeful. High information density: each sentence advances image or beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Android confronting literal childhood-fear box feels fresh; miniaturization as memory erasure twist is novel synthesis. Desert-rose farm plus magnetic pole shift grounds the speculative in tactile ecology. Risk is moderate—concept could tilt gimmicky—but execution keeps it character-driven.</comment>
