<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “diminutive titan” contradiction is asserted but never embodied—no moment shows scale surprise or limits altering tactics. Interiority drifts into synopsis (“her heart quickened”) instead of contradictory impulses under live pressure. The final “write your truth” command is clean but arrives without prior micro-choices that foreclose paths; pellet drop is symbolic, not a paid cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—rune re-signified, pretender unmasked—so RR is present. Yet causality is montage-style: “days turned into nights” skips the tightening linkage between messages and collapse; we’re told escalation, not shown narrows. Orientation is functional by 120 w, but lens ambiguity (Acc vs Causal) persists until late, softening cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Temple library is evocatively dusty-beamed, but detail stays pictorial; no shelf layout or access issue ever constrains choice. Ink pellet could serve as micro-setting but is only handled once; rune carved on spines never interacts with space or time. Ambient stones “hum” is generic; no sensory evolution under pressure, so environment never charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose pretender—is clear early. Escalation is told in summary strings (“messages grew bolder”) rather than on-page reversals that foreclose options; the ledger/diary/speech placements are listed, not dramatized. One visible cost: pretender’s frantic annotations, but Elara pays none. Agency stays abstract—no moment where a message fails or forces her tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth-through-text emerges organically, but final pellet-offering drifts toward thesis line: “shadow cast by false light” restated in dialogue. Subtext stays literal—annotations spell out fear. Resonance is moderate: rune’s re-signification is clever, yet concept of ‘drift’ remains slogan, not reweighted by Elara’s personal loss or limit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains archaic cadence with controlled syntax; “regally unpretentious” mirrors character tension. Perceptual signature is thin—no idiosyncratic filter for a titan scholar; notices are generic (“dust danced”). Dialogue snippet is serviceable but indistinct; no head-hopping. Compression in mosaic beats is readable, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies, but metaphor strings stack (“weight of centuries”, “shadow cast by false light”) in high-pressure beats without payoff, causing −0.3. Paraphrase loop: “write your truth… facade cracked… kingdom saw them” repeats collapse idea across three sentences. Otherwise clean grammar, sharp paragraphing; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Library-message warfare is fresh angle on throne-intrigue; rune-of-drift concept supplies non-obvious symbolic engine. Titan stature contradiction remains ornamental—no risk-taking payoff. Elegant compression avoids generic fantasy bloat, yet premise could swap to any rebel courier without structural loss; specificity not fully mined.</comment>
