<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “steadily curious” trait is shown through her obsessive card-and-data mapping, but the interior contradictions that would lift her into high-band remain summary. Mira appears only to deliver exposition; her exhaustion is declared, not embodied, so the relationship never becomes a crucible. The final smile and “patterns can be reversed” line lands as tidy epiphany rather than costed renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: crash → data anomalies → confide → collaborative reverse-engineering → Tower-as-blueprint insight. Closure is a conceptual repricing (“the Tower had fallen, but from its ruins…”) with undeniable social cost, satisfying Q2’s cost test. One soft spot: Mira’s blockchain evidence arrives as told summary, blunting the decisive change’s immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and returns in the final image, its inherited mystery charging the closure. The measuring tape micro-setting constrains choice when Elara literally lays it across spreadsheets to quantify stolen millions. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“rain tapped like distant Morse”) and tracks cleanly across the night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the crash was engineered—tightens when Elara weaponizes the measuring tape to calibrate the theft. One meaningful deepening: Tower card reweighted from omen to blueprint, foreclosing the option that collapse was accident. Cost is conceptual but legible: the city’s hollow pulse becomes their new map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: cultural pattern recognition as both sedative and weapon. Tower-card motif reweights from doom to design, charging the ending. Subtext resides in the measuring tape’s silence—quantification as last mysticism. The refusal to moralize lets ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds to Elara’s perceptual signature (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “swirling like storm clouds”). Diction stays within lexicon; slight register drift toward “economic shock” is absorbable. Rhythm accelerates through data lines without head-hopping. Dialogue minimal and natural; Mira’s exhaustion registers in trembling voice rather than ventriloquy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, no loops; figurative language is selective (“rain tapped…Morse code”). One mixed metaphor—“Tower card pulsing faintly, as if alive”—is tolerable. Opening and closing lines bookend with cadence shift. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fusion of cartomancy + blockchain forensics feels fresh and specific to post-crash moment. Tape-as-mystic-ruler transforms familiar detective beat. Risk is moderate: concept could slide into gimmick, but earned specificity (“each inch a million dollars lost”) keeps it grounded. Not transformative enough for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup and payoff present; curiosity drives the middle beat of laying cards on data. Lacks middle development where the trait collides with a cost—she never doubts or fatigues. Score capped at 4.6 missing development, lifted by closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Introduced by 25% mark, handled twice—measuring the fraud and the loft space—then reweighted in final image as unit of hope. Irreplaceable: no other object bridges mystic and monetary scales.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concept shapes tactics throughout: card-to-data overlay, timestamp triangulation, Tower-as-blueprint. One beat short of three; causal pressure visible but could be deeper.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Steadily curious appears early, enables the collaboration, but never exacts a price or contradiction; remains a label. Mid-band functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Confide triggers entire investigative arc; without Mira’s disclosure there is no story. Present in setup, drives middle, hovers in closure. Cost is implied societal distrust.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Multiplying paths” named late but enacted via cards-plus-data overlay; mechanics matter. Setup slightly late, but development and closure linkage strong enough to exceed cap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Loft supplies inherited mystery tone, rain acoustics, and skylight dawn for final image. Constrains choice by isolating pair from city chaos. Development beat moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>Post-crash timeframe motivates vacancy and Mira’s desperation, but no ticking clock alters tactics; functions as backdrop rather than pressure engine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mapping cultural patterns is stated motive and enacted through card-data mapping; friction appears when patterns reveal culpability, yet no personal cost is dramatized. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inherited mystery tone seeded early, sustained via loft relics and rain code, modulates to cautious dawn hope. Final image recharges tone; slight cap for late tonal shift rather than continuous modulation.</comment>
