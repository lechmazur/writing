<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her legs “wobble,” she “traces” the brass—but the self-diagnostic “broken navigator” label is asserted, not dramatized. The emotional arc is visible: compass failure → pole-method → compass tucked away, yet the decisive shift is narrated rather than embodied in a moment of visible cost. We see no contradictory impulse in scene; instead, feelings are summarized as “fractured heart” and “weight of failure.” The renunciation earns partial credit because the kayak push-off is micro-embodied, but the lacked micro-choice under pressure caps the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass is stowed, poles fade, and a “flicker of hope” reconfigures her stance with felt cost. Causality is intact: failed compass causes pole navigation causes new self-definition. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by sentence three. However, the single meaningful tightening is delivered in summary (“she no longer needed it”) rather than a dramatized beat, and the cost, while felt, is generalized—“backlash of regrets” remains abstract—keeping the story just below the 8+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-driven: salt air and “worn surface” of brass echo her erosion; utility poles’ “predictable spacing” becomes a tactile lifeline. Micro-setting (kayak hull “scarred”) doubles as character mirror. Environment guides choice—poles let her triangulate when stars fail—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Only the horizon’s “promise” flirts with cliché, preventing the final 0.1.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through navigation—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: compass failure forces adaptation to poles; this narrowing is causal and visible. No secondary reversal or tangible price (time, injury, social loss) is dramatized; the cost is emotional only and stated, not shown through forfeiture. Sufficient for the length, but the absence of a concrete loss keeps it sub-7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—navigation as self-redemption—emerges from the compass-to-poles trajectory without sermon. The final smile is a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier failures. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap or gesture carries extra meaning. The utility-pole motif recurs and shifts meaning, satisfying the recurrence test, yet the insight remains single-note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is calm, coastal, slightly lyrical—“waves lapped merrily against the shore” marries melancholy to rhythm. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices spacing, wear, salt, not tourist vistas. No dialogue, so no contamination. Filter verbs (“she felt”) intrude but are sparse; compression is taught early and maintained. Final image modulates tone successfully, meeting the 9- gate but lacking the syntactic daring or idiosyncrasy required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence length supports the meditative cadence; only two paraphrase loops (“weight of failure…fractured heart”) and one template run (“She…she…she…”) appear, not in closure. Metaphors are coherent: compass needle “mocking” stays within POV. Clean grammar, no mixed vehicles. Density is high: each paragraph advances situation or stance. Minor scaffold keeps it sub-8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: upgrading ugly utility poles to lifeline after romantic compass failure is non-obvious and specific. Emotional specificity—“merrily melancholic smile”—avoids generic redemption arc. Transformation test: swap poles for any other improvised grid and the meaning collapses, proving integration. Premise is still a familiar “recovery after failure” template without deeper world or moral twist, capping near 6.</comment>
