<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “inexplicable pull” is stated but never dramatized as contradictory impulse; the cork test and beach following are single-track, not pressured. The interiority slips into therapeutic summary (“he understood…power in subtlety”) without embodied cost. The final stance is declared, not earned by visible trade-off; silence=strength never confronts an alternative that would cost him. Motivation stays label-level; no micro-choice tightens the stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a soft epiphany—woman quotes the tag-line and vanishes, leaving Elias “not abandoned,” a Charged Poise without felt price. Causal chain: cork hum → smell → woman’s maxim is magical convenience; each leap is untested and resets rather than narrows options. Orientation clear by 50 words; no penalty, yet the lens is Accumulative/lyric, not causal, so escalation is atmospheric repetition rather than because/therefore pressure. Cost is asserted (“his doubts” gone) but not enacted or forfeited on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse, dawn-cool air, and jasmine scent are vividly filtered through Elias’s bodily attention; stones, spiral stairs, and beam rhythm ground every move. The garden-at-night scent is over-declared yet never affects physical possibility (no allergy, no disorientation), so it decorates rather than constrains. Micro-setting of cork-in-pocket returns but never alters tactical choice—no screw, no seal, no risk. Still, sensory hierarchy stays tight and POV-colored; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers > shouts”—is declared early but never tested by an opposing shout or consequence for silence; no option is foreclosed. Pressure is static mood: heat ends, cool arrives, woman appears without resistance or cost. No credible loss (job, secrecy, physical danger) is risked or paid; the tightening is purely lyrical repetition of scent/image. Escalation is accumulative texture, but without price the tension stays ambient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet intent emerges through scent and cork imagery, but the final articulation by the woman is overt thematic echo (“Whispers travel farther…”) that spells out the moral. Subtext is gestured—raised hand, cork clasp—but not complicated by counter-argument or cost, so resonance is sweet but thin. The jasmine-and-dawn motif accumulates gentle symmetry yet never reweights meaning; it merely perfumes the stated thesis. Insight feels prompt-adjacent rather than earned through friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is palpable—Elias notices damp stone, beam rhythm, cork vibration in pocket. Syntax modulates from long sensory sentences to shorter pulse as he descends, mirroring emotional lift. Diction stays within keeper-class lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is absent, so no voice convergence issue. Final woman’s murmur is reported, not ventriloquized, keeping POV clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is smooth, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the scent of the garden” repeated 3×) slows momentum. Metaphors are coherent—“invisible thread,” “screaming tenderness”—and stay within lyrical register. No mixed vehicles or register drift. Peak beat (cork inhale) is dramatized, not summarized. A few adjective stacks (“blues and grays,” “quiet strength”) border decorative but do not obscure causality. Overall read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse-as-mystic-oracle and sentient cork are gentle fantasy inflections, but the core arc—loner learns silence is power—is familiar lyric template. Freshness lies in scent-as-guide and heat-wave-break timing, yet these remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Woman’s maxim delivery is near-quotation of proverb, not transformed. Risk is stylistic sweetness rather than structural; concept stays safe middle. Specificity of keeper routine and cork texture help, but premise could swap lighthouse for tower without loss.</comment>
