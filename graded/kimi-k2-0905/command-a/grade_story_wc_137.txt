<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical-sympathetic duality is shown through her garden-tending and star-gazing routines, but the interior contradiction never tightens under pressure; the tile’s pull is accepted without visible internal argument, so the decisive surrender feels smooth rather than costly. Micro-choices (climbing the tower, transcribing) track her trait, yet the final stance crystallizes more by assertion than by earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile dissolves into starlight and Elara’s worldview is quietly repriced—she will listen annually to an “unheard symphony.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each tile glow and number shift intensifies pattern density until the final cadence reweights her purpose. Cost is conceptual yet legible—her skepticism is not refuted but made porous, foreclosing the old aloof stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eldermere’s shore, migratory whales, and the ivy-choked tower are sketched with selective, sensory strokes; the tile’s warmth and the tower’s stone pedestal constrain her handling choices. Spatial choreography stays clean as she climbs; whale breaches and star wheel are synchronized to mirror interior shift, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—longing for unnamed connection—surfaces early; escalation arrives via tile glow, melodic pull, and ancestral visions that narrow her skepticism until she accepts symphonic participation. One meaningful tightening at the tower apex reweights options; cost is conceptual (loss of detached stance) rather than visceral, adequate for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of pattern-forged belonging emerges through star-whale-migration parallels; no explicit moralizing. Final image of annual tower vigil reprises the unheard symphony, reweighting earlier isolation into chosen attunement—quiet but resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—garden dirt, star charts, tile warmth—without POV leakage. Syntax is calm, slightly lyrical, matching her measured skepticism; no dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, scaffold-free; no loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is good—single sentences layer sensory cue and emotional import. Line-level control supports the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “found mystical object awakens wonder” arc is refreshed by whale-star-migration triad and math-square motif; transformation feels specific to this coastal night rather than template. Risk is moderate; freshness lies in ecological-cosmic sync rather than plot surprise.</comment>
