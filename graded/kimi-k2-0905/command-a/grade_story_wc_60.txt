<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vividly particular (“luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed faintly”), and her micro-choices (sketching geese, pocketing the shard, slotting the final mirror-piece) track a believable arc from detached curiosity to participatory liberator. The flaw of intellectual arrogance is shown, not told, and the endurance cost—accepting her own trapped memories—lands as Earned Stasis. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, and the single-POV default is fully met, so the characterization never rises to the top decile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the fountain’s reawakening reweights the city’s ontology and her own identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each breadcrumb thickens pattern rather than forcing causal turns—and the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost (“the box now whole in her hands, its light a beacon”). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the migrating-geese pause is named as timeframe but never exploited as ticking clock, so cost is felt but not sharpened by temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains functions as micro-setting that literally constrains final action: only when the last shard is inserted at the largest fountain does water return. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Elara notices cracked basins, moss, frozen clock hands—rather than tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the breadcrumb trail. One minor gap: we never get tactile lived-in detail of how she navigates the ruins (boots on cobblestones, breath in cold air), keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens once, at the mirror-shard beat where she confronts her younger self. The deepening is accretive rather than causal, but under the Accumulative lens the pattern break (mirror = memory) reweights cost legibly. No off-stage resolution; her agency drives the final insertion. Price is conceptual rather than visceral—no blood, no forfeited tool—so the escalation stop just below the 8.5 band that demands a sharper tangible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of stained glass becoming conduit: memory is mosaic, not monolith. Subtext operates in image—water flow = narrative resurrection—without sermonizing. Final image reprices the premise: collective memory can be rehydrated, but only if someone risks seeing her own fractured past. Ambiguity lingers—will the city relapse?—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through Elara’s skeptical, moon-lit attention (“as if they carried their own moon”). Syntax swells and contracts with discovery, then compresses at mirror-moment. No dialogue appears, so no voice-convergence issue. One clause drifts toward academic register—“sidereal patience”—but it is taught early and repaid at closure, keeping the prose within 9-range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is largely clean: strong verbs (“shuddered,” “spilling”), no scaffold loops, metaphors stay coherent. Two adjacent sentences open with “The box” (minor template cadence) but the repetition is purposeful, teaching the object’s agency. No overwriting in the fountain-eruption beat. A single mixed metaphor—“memories like liquid starlight”—is vivid enough to pass. Meets the 9+ gate for zero artifact in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Forgotten city whose fountains restart only when personal shards are faced is a fresh synthesis of memory-polish folklore. Risk is taken in lyric accumulative structure rather than twist, and it pays off: pattern is taught by second paragraph and charges final image. Proximity check: no echo of famous scenes. The concept is fully committed to—no retreat into generic fantasy portal. Lacks the last ounce of idiosyncratic detail (smell of stagnant basin, pigeon bones) that would push it to 9.</comment>
