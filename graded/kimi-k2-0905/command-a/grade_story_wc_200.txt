<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “modestly fearless” stance is shown, not labeled, in her steady descent. The interior ache under the harp’s weight is concrete, and the moment she palms the warm tooth gives a micro-choice that locks her value hierarchy. Yet her flaw—needing to mend others to soothe her own ache—stays safely implicit; it never complicates the choice or backfires, so the arc is gentle, not crucible-hot. Still, within 750 words the shift from pursuer to midwife of light is credible and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because the harp extracts memory, therefore the father releases grief, therefore Elara claims the spent talisman. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the gorge fills with faint laughter, re-weighting every prior echo—so cost is felt even though no bone breaks. Orientation is clear by line 40; only nit is that the “hidden sunrise” never tightens clock or tactic, so time pressure stays atmospheric, not causal. Still, the lens stays clean and the ending image reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is more acoustic than visual; the acoustic lens narrows perception to whispers and footfalls, making setting a tool that shapes tactics—sound guides her pursuit. The harp’s misaligned strings serve as portable micro-setting; their vibration alters what can be confessed. “Luminous ache” risks poetic overlap yet stays consistent, and the gorge never dissolves into white-room. Spatial choreography is clean—she descends, confronts, collects, exits—objects track, no phantom props.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—extract confession without re-traumatising—signals early. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the father’s memory visualises; Elara must decide to keep playing (risk merging with his grief) or stop—she plays, foreclosing detachment. Cost is emotional, not physical, but legible: her own chest “aches” and the gorge ends up laughing, not her. Escalation is single-wave, not reversed, yet sufficient for flash length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: healing another re-sounds the healer. No character states it; the returning laughter in the gorge stands as non-literal answer. Subtext sits in gesture—the spent tooth warm in her palm—implying love’s residue outlives relic power. Final paragraph flirts with sentimental uplift but avoids explicit moral, letting image carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara; no head-hop. Diction—“luminous ache,” “spectral confessions”—is lyrical yet internally consistent, matching a soul-collector’s perceptual idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for descent, clipped fragments during harp strike. Father’s dialogue is spare and guttural, distinct from narrator’s cadence. Filter verbs minimal; sensory filtration feels character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean: no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm pulses—variation in sentence length mirrors breathing of gorge echoes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallises image without overwriting. Only minor scaffold: “the sound echoing through the gorge like a forgotten song” adds a second vehicle where one suffices, but it does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-echo phonics, harp-as-MRI, crocodile tooth as spent cartridge of parenthood. Premise could slide into YA cosplay but stays grounded by father’s river-loss specificity. Risk taken with “luminous ache” tone pays off—final laughter re-weights earlier abstractions into felt release. Not radically new, yet angle and compression feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
