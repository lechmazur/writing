<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses are dramatized in the sword-duel with the brain; the embodied rush of fear/joy feels earned. Interiority slips into label-speak (“vivify their own spirit”) but recovers with micro-choices (trembling hands, decisive shatter). Cost is visible: the jar shards and the emotional flood qualify as earned stasis. Flaw: duplicate-consciousness logic is asserted, not lived; brain’s voice never complicates Kael’s interiority under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each sword exchange = because/therefore test that narrows options until the jar-shatter Decisive Change lands with glass-cost. Orientation clean by 120 words; floating dojo + amber brain anchor taught early. No teleporting props; brain’s glow and sword symbols pay off closure. Minor ellipsis: clone legal status skipped, but the emotional duel overrides the gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is not postcard scenery; void glimpse during duel constrains stance (one mis-step = plummet) and charges final image. Micro-setting works: glass jar’s cool surface becomes tactile pivot moment. Sensory hierarchy follows Kael’s narrowed crisis perception—amber fluid, gleam, shatter sound—then void silence after. Lost 0.9 only because spatial choreography of sword duel vs. brain telekinesis stays vague; bodies drift un-tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim feeling—signaled in para-2; tightens when swords force Kael to choose integrate-or-lose. Agency visible: Kael strikes, parries, decides shatter; luck never rescues. Cost is felt skin-level (glass shards, emotional flood) and conceptually (now houses former self). No secondary stake dilution; history-rewrite outside is texture, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—self-division vs. reunion—emerges through sword dance and glass collapse, never sermonized. Subtext lives in silence between Lira and Kael, in amber glow that “pulses” like withheld heartbeat. Final image of merged essence offers Charged Poise without stating moral. Lost 0.5 for “complementary opposites” line that nudges toward thesis; still earns resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual lens; no head-hop. Prose texture—cool glass / void breath / pulse—mirrors thawing interior. Minor register drift: “vivify” and “complementary opposites” sound seminar-room, but occur outside peak duel beats. Rhythm accelerates with short parry lines, breathes in final void silence, supporting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openers vary, no template cadence. Information density high—“shards merged with their own”—does triple duty (action, metaphor, cost). Zero loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. Only micro-scaffold: “seemed to” appears twice in first 100 words, trimming immediacy −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of Zen sword-duel + floating brain custody battle feels fresh yet inevitable; genre tropes (dojo, yin-yang blades) are re-animated by neuro-identity stakes. Conceptual risk—telepathic sword fight with own excised organ—paid off by embodied closure. Could swap names/places but emotional arc (numb→merged) is specific enough. No close echoes of famous scenes; originality sits in metaphor-to-flesh ratio.</comment>
