<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s “listening” motive is concrete in the bell-rope beats, but interiority drifts into abstract weather-speak (“the silence spoke louder than any siren”). The final stance is earned, yet the contradictory impulse—why tug the rope the second time?—is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost. Competent, not singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s toll reframes Elias from technician to keeper, cost legible in the rain’s harmony. Causal chain holds—microclimate cue → rope tug → bell answer—though the rope’s rule-set arrives late. Orientation anchor is met by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One tightening only, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The belfry, rope, and shifting air pressure are tactile constraints that decide when and why Elias acts. Selective sensory filtering—frayed fibers, warmth in hemp, stilling wind—mirrors interior calm and charges the final resonance. Micro-setting qualifies and passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he hear the zero-hour revelation?”—tightens when the rope hums, foreclosing passive observation. Price is the tacit vow to become keeper, felt in the rain’s gentle start. Escalation is single but sufficient; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of attentive silence emerges through bell-vs-siren opposition and the rain’s soft answer; no moralizing summary. Final image reweights prior microclimate data as “whispers,” achieving CR. Minor abstraction in “world beyond the clouds” keeps it from top tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays anchored to Elias’s sensor-tuned perception; perceptual signature is consistent—pressure valves, rope fibers, wind timbre. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts; no head-hopping. Compression in “solstice hush” line is taught by context and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, but three consecutive “as if” clauses in the bell crescendo blur physical logic. Slight scaffold: “the air seemed to hold its breath” followed immediately by “the air seemed to thicken.” Information density high; no closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storm-siren-tester POV fused with living bell rope feels fresh; zero-hour concept repurposed from military trope to atmospheric threshold. Synthesis is specific enough to resist name-swap test. Risk is moderate; transformation is solid, not breathtaking.</comment>
