<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara is rendered in one specific action after another—tracing the snow-globe glass, turning pages, placing the globe down—so interiority stays concrete. The quietly analytic trait is shown through cataloguing, pausing at ink blots, following the map; it is not merely labeled. Motivation (“physics of letting go”) is visible in how she treats artifacts: she neither hoards them nor flinches from decay, and the final renunciation of the globe costs her something we have watched her covet. The absence of a second on-page character limits relationship pressure, and the single epiphanic paragraph edges toward summary, but the final gesture still carries a palpable forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: linking occurs through density of artifacts, recursive images (snow globe re-settling), and cadence shift to “lullaby” rather than causal reversals. Orientation is swift (first paragraph anchors who/where/when in 30 words). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the globe’s final placement reweights earlier hoarding into release, with the sailor’s letter supplying the visible rule change at cost. The only friction is a mid-story information parcel (map drop) that momentarily stalls momentum, but the tightened final beat compensates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Damp plank, luminous ink, silt halo around the wooden box—tactile particulars arrive only when they shape Elara’s next move. The snow-globe micro-setting doubles as environmental constraint: it can be shattered, must be cradled with two hands, and its intact fragility incites the theme of release. Spatial choreography is clean across the swim-in/swim-out single scene; no impossible prop jumps. The globe’s glass charges the final image as both setting and tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand letting go”—is signaled early and narrowed by each artifact; every discovery threatens her reflex to catalogue and keep. Meaningful tightening occurs when the sailor’s letter re-prices the globe from treasure to lesson; this single deepening forces her final renunciation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: density of unfinished narratives accumulates emotional cost rather than external jeopardy. The price (leaving the globe behind) is visible and irreversible inside the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of objects meant to be read, not owned; the snow globe’s final stillness answers the opening swirl without authorial comment. Subtext operates in Elara’s hands: lingering touch early, open palm at the end. The ending resists moralizing—“lullaby” replaces sermon. Conceptual cost is undeniable: she exits lighter yet lonelier, inviting reflection on what archivists forfeit in order to archive themselves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Free-indirect diction—“quiet reminder of something she couldn’t quite name”—carries scientist precision fused with melancholy drift. Perceptual signature filters environment through archaeological priorities: she notices brittleness of paper before color of ink. Rhythm modulates from long clause-cadences of cataloguing to fragment-like final line (“lullaby”) that mimics breath released. No head-hopping; distance stable; non-standard punctuation absent, so no deductions apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between rolling accumulative lists and hard stops (“It was a key, though she didn’t yet know what it unlocked”) that mimic silt puffs. Information density is high: one line often fuses sensory cue, interior tilt, and foreshadowing. One scaffold pair appears—“she turned it slowly, watching the synthetic snow swirl” is almost restated in adjacent lines, a −0.2 infraction but does not recur at closure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: marine-archaeological quiet fused with Death-as-colleague re-energizes both tropes; specificity (Earhart shell vs. library lullaby) prevents template feel. Snow globe as memento-mori object is familiar, yet its treatment—intact in a water-logged wreck—grounds the concept in believable paradox, making the inversion feel inevitable. Final “lullaby” re-casts the entire wreck from tomb to cradle without a single explanatory sentence. The risk of lyric stillness in closure heightens rather than dilutes stakes.</comment>
