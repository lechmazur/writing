<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyric but thin; the “meteor hush” longing never becomes a concrete contradiction in scene. His single micro-choice—descending the hatch—alignes with established drift, yet no bodily cost or conflicting impulse is dramatized. The final vow feels serene rather than charged because prior beats lack visible trade-off. Voice remains consistent, but emotional embodiment stays in soft-focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank page inscribes Elias’s luminous vow, reweighting the night sky. Causal chain is light—key glows, therefore book opens—but causal ellipsis is acceptable under lyric-accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no late ambiguity. Cost is present yet diffuse; the price is opportunity rather than tangible loss, keeping the beat just under high-band punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Harbor air, lantern glare, and water-lit sand are sketched with selective sensory economy. The sunken-library micro-setting functions as charged object: dry pages undersea pressure Elias’s vow, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial logic keeps the library dream-plausible; no impossible geography. Idiom stays restrained; “meteor hush” risks poetic abstraction but recurs enough to earn a cadence slot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—to discover “the color of sound”—is declared late and remains metaphorical, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is accretive: each glow layers mystique until the vow crystallizes; this is legitimate under Accumulative lens but thin on visible price. No option is foreclosed; Elias gains a quest without losing or risking anything on-page. Enough tightening for mid-band, but lacks a tangible trade-off to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated light-images shifting from wish to vow; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext operates in silence: the unlit staircase, the unreadable language, the empty final page. Final image reprices sky lanterns as votive obligations rather than idle hopes, achieving quiet resonance. Complexity is present but circumscribed by brevity; ambiguity feels willed yet not deep enough for top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, tidal cadence that mirrors harbor ambiance. Perceptual signature centers on light, metal temperature, and water hush—specific and consistent. No dialogue to test naturalism; narration stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Filter verbs (“he felt”) appear but align with reflective mode; syntactic repetition is intentional, creating chant-like propulsion rather than monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly free of scaffold; only minor softeners (“quiet hum of the harbor”) flirt with cliché. Sentences breathe with paragraph variety; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is restrained; “meteor hush” metaphor is repeated but patterned, not cluttered. Clause density is modest; the piece prioritizes atmosphere over information, acceptable for lyric mode but caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—mysterious key, sunken wonder-library, sky lanterns—are recombined through sensory specificity and vow motif. The “color of sound” quest feels fresh, conceptually poetic rather than SFF stock. Risk level is moderate; no structural daring, but integration is coherent. Transformation is modest: swap names and setting, emotional arc still functions, preventing higher originality score.</comment>
