<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “infinitely patient” trait is dramatized through tactile knot-work and humming fulgurite, not label; interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulses onstage—risk-free patience flattens urgency. The final smile is earned but the cost is atmospheric, not personal; we see no path foreclosed. Seed-collector vocation seeds theme yet never shapes tactics; rope decoding could belong to any obsessive academic.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral-within-spiral knot decoded reweights prior material, confirmed by “ancient methods were safe.” Causal lens holds: each knot advance follows tactile probing; fog and glass serve as textured mirrors, not coincidences. Orientation anchored by sentence three; no set-up debt. Cost is collective, not protagonist-specific; still, the world-in-breath-hush makes cultural loss felt.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Golden dock under snow is sensory, selective, and filters through Elara’s artifact-attuned gaze. Snow-muffled planks and lightning-born glass constrain movement and echo pattern-seeking. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single static location. Environment does not physically alter tactics; micro-setting charges final image but lacks causal squeeze—caps entry below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve weaver knowledge—signaled early and escalates via knot density. One meaningful tightening: spiral-within-spiral demands new cognitive leap. Agency is attention-based; path foreclosed when final knot “yielded its meaning,” cultural loss averted. Cost is collective-cultural, not personal; lack of visible personal price keeps score from 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—transmission of lost embodied knowledge—emerges through rope decoding, not sermon. Spiral/fulgurite fractals mirror pattern’s universality without forcing allegory. Final hush offers Charged Poise that invites reflection on cultural memory. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about who will carry practice forward, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early: “oceanic hush,” “snow-muffled planks,” maintained to last line. Perceptual signature is patient, haptic, tuned to micro-fractals. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Rhythm breathes with scene’s contemplative tempo; compression and patterned diction remain legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; sentences shorten under knot-focus without syntactic monoculture. Strong verbs—“gleamed,” “lapped,” “coax”—replace modifiers. No paraphrase loops; fulgurite and spiral return with reweighted meaning. One mixed metaphor—“veins of a leaf” for lightning glass—slight blemish, not closure-touching; density high, momentum steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fisherman-knot-as-archive offers fresh cultural angle; not typical puzzle-box trope. Synthesis of maritime craft, fractal glass, and philosophical seed-keeper feels idiosyncratic. Risk-taking modest—quiet lyric over dramatic turn—yet coherent to length and lens. Could swap fulgurite for another natural fractal with minor edits, capping score below 8.5.</comment>
