<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Herald’s interiority is lyrically voiced, but the only embodied cost is a hand warming on the wick; the pivotal choice to open the gateway is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-moves, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the green dawn reconfigures the Herald’s role with undeniable conceptual cost (“bridge between worlds”). Causal chain holds—wick twist → beam veer → fog gate—though the veer is externally triggered, not a character-initiated reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lantern room, wick, and sea-fog work as micro-settings that constrain every move; star-canvas and green beam evolve with the beat, feeding the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as the Herald leans, grips, steers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seize or reject the unknown dawn—is signaled early and tightens when control of the beam is lost. One meaningful deepening: the Herald pivots from panic to resolve, paying the price of perpetual guardianship; cost is legible in the final bow from the fog-beings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy transmission (“ancient shadows into new dawn”) emerges through the wick’s refraction and the Herald’s laughter-turned-battle-cry, avoiding explicit thesis. Ambiguity persists: are the visitors salvation or burden, keeping resonance alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice carries a consistent maritime-lit cadence; laughter motif modulates from whimsical to defiant without register drift. Perceptual signature—light-as-sword, fog-as-alive—remains anchored to the Herald’s sensorium.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphors (sword-of-light, chorus of gratitude) are disciplined, no mixed vehicles or loops. Information density is high—each line advances image or stakes—producing clean propulsion toward the dawn reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse-as-portal trope is refreshed via optics (“total internal reflection” steering) and a green-spectrum dawn. The fusion of newspaper after-hours nostalgia with mythic ingress feels non-obvious and inevitable after the beam veers.</comment>
