<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—save the island’s memory before the monsoon—remains clear, but her interiority stays generic (“her heart steady,” “mind racing”) and never acquires a perceptual fingerprint. The single decisive choice—answering the riddle—restates theme rather than revealing new internal contradiction, so the promised cost is conceptual, not felt. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values; she simply articulates the moral. The audience learns her role, not her person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—dream clue → climb → riddle → seed → plant → tree survives—but every causal node is narrated in summary, so pressure leaks out between beats. The orientation anchor (who/where) appears within the first 120 words, satisfying the test, yet the dream/seed logic is asserted rather than demonstrated, keeping the linkage thin. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (tree = saved memory), but no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics; the victory feels pre-ordained. A single meaningful tightening is present—the riddle moment—but it is rhetorical, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ridge is sketched with lyrical strokes (“blooms opening and closing as if in rhythm with her heartbeat”) that supply texture but never constrain physical choice or become a tool she must exploit. Spatial choreography is fuzzy: the climb, distance, and village commons are asserted, not mapped, so the environment never endangers or enables. Weather’s only function is postponed arrival, so it tightens nothing on the page. The knowledge fruit seed itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, just meeting the 9+ gate, but the ridge remains picturesque backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (cultural memory loss) are declared early and repeated, yet no on-page symptom of that loss—mis-sung lyric, erased carving, forgotten name—materializes to make the threat visceral. Pressure escalates only by calendar (“monsoon coming”) rather than by mounting obstacles or harder choices; Elara meets no setback, alternate path, or resource limit. Agency is limited to answering a single riddle; the rest is walking, planting, and narrating success. The cost is conceptual, not dramatized, so the tightening feels gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—fantasy and reality as partners in memory—emerges cleanly through the seed’s hybrid nature and the owl-serpent guardian, avoiding overt thesis statements until the riddle scene, where it edges close to Echo territory. Subtext is present but thin: no image or gesture later undercuts or deepens the claim, so the idea finishes where it began. The final image (tree in storm) reiterates rather than reconfigures meaning. A resonant aftereffect is hinted, but because no concrete loss is risked or paid, the insight feels safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical mode stays stable; diction aspires to mythic cadence but drifts into elevated generics (“sanctuary of collective memory,” “luminous doubt”). Filter verbs are few, yet sentence rhythm defaults to rolling periodic clauses that mute urgency under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is avoided; however, the creature’s choral whisper and Elara’s inner register sound indistinguishable from the narrator, flattening vocal contrast. Perceptual signature is present in the ridge/bloom personification but not in Elara’s cognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is pleasant but template-driven: stock metaphor strings (“intertwined like vines on a trellis,” “dissolve like ink in water”) appear in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff, triggering −0.4 under density rule. Phrase loops recur (“the island’s memory,” “collective memory,” “cultural memory”) and a scaffold sentence repeats the dream/seed structure twice with near-identical wording. Sentence openings vary moderately; paragraphing follows soft scene breaks rather than tension pivots. Grammar is clean, but purple tint and synonym churn dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The “reality-checker” role and memory-bearing fruit seed refresh familiar quest templates, yet both remain abstract: we never see Elara perform a unique checking technique or the fruit behave differently from any sacred MacGuffin. The owl-serpent guardian is a striking hybrid, but its riddle reiterates rather than complicates the theme. Specificity arrives in floral ridge imagery, but the world logic stays default fairy-tale. A fresh inflection is hinted—empirical whimsy—yet never dramatized as an off-beat method, so the concept feels sketched, not synthesized.</comment>
