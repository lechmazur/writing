<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s calm-fisher veneer is credibly maintained, but his interiority stays on a single register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the “cool-headed” trait never wobbles or costs him anything. The final “listen” choice is less a renunciation than a polite agreement; no path is foreclosed, no price is felt. Thus the arc is smooth but shallow, missing the hair-line flaw that would make the calm heroic or tragic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is signaled early—constellation chaos, silence-music—and holds: each sensory layer thickens until the goddess apparition crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a legit Charged Poise: the rail spike glows, the garden’s song is rewired, Kael’s stance is reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost (“he had helped to restore” the cosmic lullaby). No orientation drift; transitions are legible within the single scene window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden is rendered through selective synaesthesia—silence that “carries whispers,” soil that vibrates—so the setting itself is the antagonistic pressure. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet clean: pool edge → walking → goddess apparition → pool return, props tracked. The rail spike’s final glow proves the micro-setting object can charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3 even at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the echo”—is clear; pressure escalates texturally via sensory density rather than narrowing options. The goddess’s appearance is gift, not test; Kael’s agency is receptive (listen) rather than decisive trade-off. Cost is conceptual but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping escalation just inside the 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-feral-stillness emerges organically from setting and closure image; no explicit thesis asserts itself. The silence-as-music motif reweights at the end, inviting reflection without moralizing. Complexity is present but not sharp—goddess offers no counter-claim—so resonance lingers lightly rather than disturbingly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence; diction stays within Kael’s perceptual orbit (“calloused hands,” “nets and lines”). Sentence rhythm mirrors the zig-zag motion without falling into template drumbeat. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt,” “he realized”) dull immediety but do not contaminate voice at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and micro-action. Figurative language is patterned early (“silence had a voice”) and paid off, avoiding purple accretion. A few soft repeats—“silence,” “lullaby” used three times in closing paragraph—could be trimmed, but they do not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusion of astronomicon-steampunk (rail spike as tuning key) with silence-myth is fresh, yet the fisher-goddess dyad recalls familiar numinous-encounter templates. Specificity of “sound wave garden” and the spike’s re-purposing supply enough inflection to feel transformed rather than borrowed. Risk is present but decorous; the piece stops short of letting the feral actually wound Kael’s calm.</comment>
