<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s survivor-guilt engine is vivid and embodied; the “failure lived in her bones” line crystallizes her. Interior contradiction flares when she breaks her deathbed promise, yet the moment is rushed—one clause of trembling fingers before the lid lifts. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: knowledge > oath > solitude, but we get only a single beat of visible cost (the long walk down) rather than a durably altered stance. The voice is individual, but the final renunciation (“she would be ready”) is predictive, not yet enacted, so the cost feels prospective, not paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the new rule “discord that held worlds apart” reweights every prior keeper song with irrevocable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because she saw the flaw, she now embraces the forbidden flute and the solitary path. The persistent constraint (she alone must sing dissonance) is legible in the final paragraph. One scaffold only: “She returned the flute… began the long walk down” could compress, but it does not dull the reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>Thunder-echo Range is more than postcard; its silence presses eardrums and later becomes the canvas for the new dissonant song. The driftwood markers and the gilded flute act as micro-settings that constrain return logistics and ritual possibility. Spatial choreography is clean—three-path junction, hollow, altar tracked without drift. The final image of silent peaks reconfigured as “potential” is charged by the protagonist’s altered stance, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the next veil tear—signals early and tightens when she decides to break the taboo. One meaningful deepening: harmony → discord revelation. Cost is felt: renunciation of community, acceptance of future sole responsibility. Agency is internal (decision to embrace dissonance) but still forecloses the old keeper path; visible price is the echoing solitude she now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: failure as teacher, discord as necessary boundary. The shift from “old songs” to “beautiful discord” reweights the meaning of music itself. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line lets silence equal potential. Subtext in gesture—closing the clasps, walking down—implies the cost better than exposition could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is stable and textured: “avalanchingly quiet” mints a fresh adverb; copper-tasting air is character-specific. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for ascent, staccato flute notes for rupture. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly within Mira. Register stays inside a ritual-keeper lexicon; no academic leakage. Final image’s syntactic fragment “Potential.” is purposeful, not lazy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and world-logic payload. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent (veil as permeable membrane, song as weave). Minor scaffold: “She returned the gilded reed flute to its case, closed the clasps, and began the long walk down” could compress to two actions, but rhythm serves descent pacing. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—failed guardians reverse-engineer their own taboo—feels fresh against portal-keeper tropes. Specificity of driftwood from “River of Returns” and the gold-leaf map of thin places transforms familiar flute into singular artifact. Risky second-person time-witness is handled without rupturing causality. The inversion that harmony was the mistake is non-obvious and earned. Could edge higher if the world’s geopolitical stakes beyond Mira were hinted, but within 800 words the focus stays tautly personal.</comment>
