<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s reinvention-from-pigeon-trainer is vivid, but the “learned to love decay and possibility” beat is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is present (guilt vs. need for silence) yet never crystallizes in a high-cost micro-choice; the confession to Mira is low-stakes because Mira has no opposing desire. Earned stasis is credible but feels moderate; the meteorite-as-mirror works, yet the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Track B mosaic (four shards) taught by 25 % and lands a clean CR: the meteorite reweights “falling, forgetting, finding” for both bird-stone-self. Transitions (newspaper wrap → skylight ritual → Mira’s arrival) are legible; each shard adds density rather than causal plot, satisfying Accumulative lens. Closure image—“dust settled into darkness, waiting for tomorrow’s sun”—carries conceptual cost: she accepts perpetual vulnerability of trust. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Skylight beam and dust motes function as micro-setting that constrains her daily ritual and charges the final image; attic decay is smelled, felt, budgeted for. Sensory selection is POV-tied (pigeon-ear memory of wind vs. book-must). Sparse but vivid; no object or environmental detail breaks choice logic. Could reach 9-zone if attic bled into one higher-cost decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she risk being known again?”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via Accumulative pattern (dust → meteorite → journal) rather than causal reversal. No visible price is felt on-page until the final CR image; prior beats are observational, not tactical. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope but lacks a moment where trust choice forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: dust, chip, birds, paper trails—all carriers of messages that outlive their carriers. No final-paragraph thesis statement; last line lets image reprice trust as cyclical falling/finding. Ambiguity is purposeful: she may still flee again. Minor softness: “songs we carry across impossible distances” drifts toward proverbial, docking 0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third-person single POV; perceptual signature filters world through avian motion and attic light. Syntax mirrors breath: long clause for circling motes, abrupt stop for meteorite burn. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but narration stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (no direct scandal recount) is taught early and paid off in confession beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does atmosphere + memory + foreshadowing. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into confession, then relaxes into dust-image cadence. Register holds; no corporate diction. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of pigeon trainer + Martian meteorite + book-attic dust is fresh; metaphoric linkage of stone and bird as message vessels feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric mosaic rather than dramatic plot—but coherence stays high. Not quite bold enough for top band: premise is memorable yet not structurally daring.</comment>
