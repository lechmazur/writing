<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—rational chemist vs. grieving mother—remains vivid and embodied; the chrysalis-handling beats show hierarchy of values (science vs. memory) with visible cost. The final lab renunciation is earned: her pivot from permanent adhesives to dissolvable scaffold grows directly from the river insight and the pocketed chrysalis. Only minor slip: “loosened grief…almost like peace” edges toward therapeutic abstraction in the closure beat, blunting full 9-band punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patent filing crystallizes her new stance—temporary bridges, not cages—with undeniable social cost (she relinquishes the fantasy of undoing loss). Causal lens holds throughout: river-foam epiphany → polymer redesign → patent; no retroactive fixes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the braided ravine anchors who-where-when and feeds the final image. Persistent constraint (chrysalis on desk) shapes the closing gesture, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ravine’s foam patterns actively constrain her scientific imagination; the chrysalis micro-setting doubles as lab talisman and molecular model. Sensory selection skews tactile-visual in chemist-specific ways—she notices lattice, shear, translucence. Final image of clouds “braided like streams, like foam” loops environment back through POV bias, charging the closure. One hairline slip: “clouds moved…like the molecular chains” risks overt symbolic symmetry, but the phrasing stays in her professional lexicon, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens once: the river teaches that contact persists after divergence, forcing her to abandon permanent-bond research. Cost is legible: she accepts a dissolving scaffold that will vanish, trading control for facilitation. No false escalation; pressure accumulates under causal lens. Missing a second middle beat that further narrows lab resources or reputation risk; hence stops short of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the foam→chrysalis→membrane chain: impermanence as generative, not failed, connection. Subtext operates in the silent lab scenes—her night-long synthesis is a secular vigil. Final image reframes patent filing as elegy, avoiding moralizing. One tiny echo of thematic label “translate separation into connection” appears late; barely audible, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains chemist’s perceptual signature: fractal geometry, molecular vocabulary, measured syntax that loosens only when grief surfaces. Rhythm modulates—short paratactic clauses under lab pressure, longer braided sentences during river watch. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. One clause—“her grief loosened into something that felt almost like peace”—edges toward self-diagnosis, but context keeps it credible interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-true (“foam traced white lines across dark water”). High information density: the chrysalis-handling beat simultaneously reveals memory, metaphor, and future polymer geometry. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match the earned exhale without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-driven polymer science reframed through hydrological patterning and lepidopteran architecture. The dissolvable neural scaffold is a non-obvious extrapolation of “separation ≠ erasure,” not a stock grief metaphor. Risk-taking—using river foam as scientific method—pays off without gimmickry. Could push higher with a sharper external obstacle (funding board, skeptical colleague) to stress the premise further.</comment>
