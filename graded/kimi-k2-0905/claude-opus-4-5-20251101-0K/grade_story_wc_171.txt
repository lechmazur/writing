<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the ebony clipboard as inherited burden anchors her contradictory impulses. The decision to admit “you cannot” trust peace but to sign anyway crystallizes her earned stasis with visible cost. Flaws (exhaustion, habitual gentleness) complicate rather than decorate. Missing 9.0 only because the General and Marshmother remain slightly emblematic, their grief stated more than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the handshake and Elara’s descent reconfigure meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens—ink on paper plus celestial movement re-weight decades of grief. Causality holds: the ritual alignment she orchestrates forces the simultaneous signatures, and the exhausted “tomorrow” stance forecloses rest. Orientation is anchored by line 3; transitions are seamless within the single terrace scene. Cost is legible in her throat-clench and the heavy clipboard at the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terrace, twin-moon shadows, and valley of bones supply micro-setting that constrains the ritual timing and supplies the charged final image. Weathered limestone, reed-whisper robes, and guttering torches are filtered through Elara’s negotiator eye—selective, professional, exhausted. No spatial drift; bodies remain tracked. The ebony clipboard acts as portable setting-extension, its surface history altering her grip choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the treaty stick—tightens when Elara concedes uncertainty yet presses the pens forward, narrowing options from negotiation to irrevocable ink. Escalation is accumulative: each named dead child layers density until the moons’ alignment forces the irreversible micro-turn. Cost is felt in her throat constriction and the clipboard’s inherited weight. Agency is hers; neither side’s sudden handshake feels coincidental because she staged the cosmic trigger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Redemption emerges as lifetime installment, not moral—woven through wildflowers rooted in ribcages and the clipboard’s crossed-out names. No final-paragraph sermon; the last image of Elara descending the steps re-prices “peace as practice” without stating it. The flawed beauty motif modulates from valley to handshake to dawn, each iteration gaining wearier texture. Theme resists tidy closure, inviting the reader to tally future installments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “operatively gentle fingers,” “throat constricted around the words.” Diction remains within her exhausted diplomat register—no corporate drift. Rhythm compresses under torch-gutter breeze, then lengthens with dawn bleed. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Theron’s ceremonial stiffness versus Kell’s reed-whisper flatness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density—clipboard history, celestial mechanics, named dead—packed without scaffolding. Metaphors (wildflowers in bones, moons indifferent yet complicit) cohere and reappear at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif seamlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusing cosmic ritual with bureaucratic clipboard freshens the well-worn peace-table trope. The “lifetime installments” angle on redemption offers non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity of the Valley of Echoes and twin-moon shadows prevents generic fantasy setting. Slight familiarity in grizzled-veteran negotiator archetype keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>
