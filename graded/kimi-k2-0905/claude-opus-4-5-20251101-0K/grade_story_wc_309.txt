<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for magic while surrendering the need to possess it—plays out in embodied beats (the mist-walk, the crystal returned to the bag). The final renunciation is earned because the text has shown her tactile disappointment and the automatons’ sterile triumph. Cost is visible: she leaves empty-handed, fingertips glowing with “nothing” that is now something. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each chamber adds density of impossibility until the garden crystallizes the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and never loosens. Closure is a Charged Poise—she forgoes extraction and the world reframes value; the cost is the forfeiture of proof in a world that only credits proof. No causal break; ellipsis between stairwell and garden is taught by prior “mist walking” cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice-sheathed walls, frozen vapor, petrified flowers—each tactile detail filters through Mara’s sensory priorities and constrains her next move (mist-walk required because stairs collapse). The folly’s arch literally crowns the scene and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: 300th step → crack → courtyard → arch → keystone. No exposition dump; world rules emerge by action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find meaning the machines can’t quantify”—tightens when she refuses to quantify the luminance. One meaningful deepening: crystal raised, then dropped back; option foreclosed, price registered. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each impossible corridor adds weight to her doubt. Cost is legible: she abandons the only tangible trophy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: value lies in irreducible presence, not extractable utility. The keystone’s “lingering luminance” reweights from coveted resource to witness-event. Final line’s distinction between “manufacture wonder” and “manufacture wondering” offers conceptual repricing that ricochets through the text. No moralizing; ambiguity remains—she is still “underachieving,” yet transformed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “light that had forgotten how to leave.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens during mist-walk, mirroring flux of solidity. No head-hop; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature sustains through final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective (“brilliant dimness”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels ascent-then-rest rhythm. Minor filter verb (“she felt nothing”) is voice-motivated and immediately grounded in bodily context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Automatons commodifying creativity is familiar sf territory, but the inversion—renouncing extraction of “lingering luminance”—feels specific and inevitable to this character. Impossible architecture and mist-walking are tropes, yet rendered through Mara’s sensory alienation, not spectacle. Final distinction between wonder and wondering supplies fresh inflection. Risky quiet ending lands because text earned the poise.</comment>
