<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—lonely archivist of other people’s dreams who now must finish a stranger’s farewell—drives every beat; the micro-choice to pencil the witness-line under the Edelweiss is the earned cost that forecloses his own eremitic neutrality. Borrowed-memory gift versus solitary identity is dramatized, not labeled. Flaw (eccentricity) complicates rather than decorates: the same habit that lets him receive memories makes him the perfect final recipient. No safety-hedging; the refusal to announce the mountain woman’s fate keeps moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the empty page becomes a communal space where stranger, woman, and keeper coexist, reconfiguring Elias’s isolation at undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the skipped-logbook pattern taught early (every seventh day) accumulates into the final handwriting act. Causality is present but subordinate—he acts *because* the gaps invited him—fitting the lyric design. Cost proof: “The sea took his body, but his love stayed stubborn…” makes the price legible in one sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Opal dock’s iridescent planks and bruised twilight light are not backdrop but instrument: the glow literally enables night-reading of the logbook and motivates the full-moon vigils. Micro-setting (pressed alpine flower) constrains the final gesture—only this object could mountain-signal across oceanic distance. Spatial choreography clean: dock length, mist swallow, body placement tracked without drift. Weather (mist thickening) times the beat of memory intrusion, forcing the pencil act now, not later.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the stranger’s silence be given voice?—tightens once: the discovery of the empty seventh-day pattern converts passive reading into active writing, foreclosing Elias’s option to remain mere witness. Cost is conceptual but felt: by filling the blank he adopts the stranger’s bereavement, trading borrowed memories for owned grief. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative pattern-break. Could edge higher if a visible external loss (time, physical risk) were dramatized on page, but lyrical design legitimates the interior price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transmission across impossible distances—mountain to sea, stranger to keeper, memory to paper—renders isolation porous yet unbreakable. Subtextual symmetry (gap as gift) is earned by the repeating seventh-day absences, not imposed. Final image reweights premise: the lighthouse beam, once solitary, now carries two silences. No moralizing; the refusal to narrate the woman’s reception keeps theme open but charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “language of silences,” “salt of lives he had never lived”—diction that only a lifelong eavesdropper on emptiness would use. Rhythm modulates: long clause-stack sentences for contemplative beats, then clipped fragments (“The memory fractured”) under intrusion. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy stays intact. Compression (“borrowed memories, he called them”) teaches the lyric pattern early; payoff in final handwritten sentence is seamless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety avoids template cadence; metaphors (dock as “pale finger,” twilight as “bruised”) are spare, never stacked. Information density high: one sentence slips biographical data, sensory detail, and emotional stance (“weathered hands clutching the logbook that had washed ashore three days prior”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Minor near-loop: “mist” appears four times in closing paragraph—just under overuse threshold, forgiven because it is the accruing agent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse keeper who inherits another man’s farewell—feels inevitable yet unfamiliar; alpine/sea collision is fresh without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if relocated: the salt–alpine contradiction is irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure arrives via handwriting on empty page, not via confrontation. No derivative echoes; Edelweiss trope is rescued from Sound-of-Music cliché by being dried, brown, and functionally postal.</comment>
