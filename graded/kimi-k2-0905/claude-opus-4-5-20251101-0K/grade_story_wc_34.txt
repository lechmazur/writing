<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her “tinkersong wonder” voice, the tactile brass at her throat, the grandmother’s bolt plate as heirloom compass. The contradiction of isolation vs. vocation is embodied: she sings to ghosts because living ears never listened. Her final decision—to keep singing in secret murals—costs her any future audience, a renunciation legible on-page. The only minor gap: we’re told her name is forgotten but never shown how that erasure stings in-scene; the pain is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mosaic of four shards (courtyard → bridge warehouse → monastery stones → descent) is taught by the 25% mark and lands a clean Charged Poise closure: ghost dispersed into her song, Mira committed to covert murals. Causal logic holds: each graffiti find is a because/therefore breadcrumb that narrows her options to “sing or let the code die.” The cost is palpable—she descends alone, voice now encoded into walls nobody is required to read. The bolt-plate reprise in the last paragraph is the visible constraint that forecloses direct speech forever.</comment>

<comment>The floating mist-courtyard is never over-described; instead it supplies sensory filtration (cold brass, lightning flash, swirling pixels) that directly shapes perception. Micro-setting succeeds: the bolt plate functions as portable monastery—compression chamber for memory. Spatial choreography is flawless across rope-ladder descents and mural hunts. Only the bridge-warehouse paragraph drifts toward postcard listing; the rest keeps environment pressed into character goal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“give silence a voice”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ghost’s plea “HELP ME REMEMBER” appears in condensation. Each graffiti discovery escalates by shrinking Mira’s timeline: three months of static whispers → coordinates → overnight murals → monastery stone. The irreversible turn comes when she chooses to absorb the ghost into her own secret murals, paying the price of permanent anonymity. Cost is visible: she descends alone, songs “rarely sung aloud,” voice now walls rather than air.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation: petals pressed flat = memory flattened into code = song flattened into graffiti. No moral is stated; the final image reweights the premise—silence is not lack but a new medium. Subtext lurks in bolt-plate warmth (compression as intimacy) and lightning-thunder gap (articulation delayed). The reader is left to feel that all unspoken things already sing, just on surfaces we forget to read.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Mira’s perceptual bias—sound as texture, code as bloom, time as lightning-interval. Syntax widens and contracts with emotional temperature, never drifting into editorial omniscience. Diction stays within a tinker-poet lexicon: “tinkersong,” “flattened melodies,” “pixels that looked like condensation.” No head-hopping; ghost POV is surface-only, filtered through her interpretation. Voice modulation under pressure is audible in the final sentence cascade: short declaratives → em-dash dilation → quiet last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence either compresses time (“She had spent weeks…”) or advances sensory knowledge. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, every image (bolt plate = monastery, graffiti = petals) returns to the preservation motif. High information density: “the ghost began to dissolve—not disappearing, but dispersing into something larger” performs three jobs (visual, emotional, conceptual) in twelve words. Final line earns its brevity by echoing the opening “Few had ever heard her sing,” now recontextualized as voluntary silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “ghost in the code” premise is familiar cyber-ghost turf, yet the graft onto balladeer-presser, graffiti-as-petals, and lightning-thunder as articulation window feels fresh. Risk is taken in the lyric-mosaic structure; the pattern is taught early enough to prevent disorientation. Specificity anchors novelty: bolt plate not just heirloom but portable compression chamber; graffiti not vandalism but steganographic blossom. Transformation test passes—swap bolt plate for cassette, cloud-monastery for orbital station, and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
