<comment>Marina’s motives—inheritance of her father’s puzzle-mind filtered through musical obsession—are legible and consistent. The embodied emotion is mostly filtered through precise spatial noticing rather than visceral contradiction, so interiority feels coolly analytical, not contradictory. The micro-choice to weave the child’s laughter into the cadenza shows her hierarchy of values, but the moment is summarized rather than dramatized with cost. Closure offers an earned renunciation: she accepts that tomorrow’s randomness will erase tonight’s calculations, a visible forfeiture of certainty.</comment>

<comment>Single continuous scene, one POV; orientation (who/where/when) anchored within first 80 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each calculated detail (bishop placement, tide schedule, acoustic map) thickens the texture until the final reverb of coins and distorted star-ripples reweights the premise—wonder can be engineered yet remain wild. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop back in pocket, the arcade’s geometry already eroding, her smile disappearing between columns—options reconfigured, cost felt.</comment>

<comment>Sensory economy is excellent: salt reflections, wet stone resonance, moonlit marble curves all serve acoustics and foot-traffic geometry. The tidal arcade functions as micro-setting: every column and pool constrains where she stands, where the bishop must sit, how sound travels. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions as crowds drift, child splashes, coins fall. Final image of receding water distorting star-mirrors recharges the earlier “scattered chess pieces” motif with closure cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can engineered wonder survive its own success without becoming sterile? Pressure mounts by accumulation: each calibrated variable (bishop, tide, patron schedule) tightens the noose of expectation; the child’s unscripted laughter supplies the micro-turn that forces adaptation. Cost is present but soft—she forfeits tonight’s perfect configuration to tomorrow’s tide rather than paying a social or physical price. Sufficient intensification for this length, yet not a visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: randomness as co-author rather than enemy. Subtext lives in gesture—the bishop reclaimed from moonlight, coins landing beside it—never stated. Final image of ripples scrambling star-reflections offers a non-literal answer: control dissolves into new constellations, meaning renegotiated nightly. Resists moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is precise, cool, musical: “constellations like scattered chess pieces,” “acoustics of this place,” “astronomy and acoustics aligned.” Syntax is clean, rhythmic, never drifts into overture-purple. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“She watched faces transform”) they amplify her observer stance. No head-hop; psychic distance stable; diction stays within a self-taught street-mathematician’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies—long reflective sentences contract into tight clauses under pressure (“Coins clinked… startled birds”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence moves. Figurative language is disciplined: “applause scattered like startled birds” is earned, singular, not piled. Only minor slip: “seemed to glow in harmony with” is a faint filter hedge; excising “seemed” would sharpen the beat. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of street-performance, chess-puzzle inheritance, and tidal acoustics feels fresh and specific; removing any layer collapses the concept. Bishop-as-magnet for engineered coincidence is a non-obvious twist on found-object art. Risk is taken: the entire plot is anticipation of a single moment—yet the gamble pays off in a resonant, quiet after-image. Transformation test passes: the arc depends on this exact arcade, this tide, this inherited bishop.</comment>
