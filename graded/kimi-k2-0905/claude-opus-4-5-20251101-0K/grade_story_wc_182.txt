<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her leap from treating the mountain as obstacle to wounded guardian is embodied in the shift from decoding roots to speaking them. The “language of growing things” moment crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation of extraction for reciprocity. Thessaly’s re-appearance is slightly under-motivated (no on-page sign she can leave until she does), muting the emotional payoff. Still, the protagonist’s flaw—intellectual colonialism—drives the mistake and its repair, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite that late wobble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mira deciphers the diary’s chlorophyll map, therefore she reaches the mountain; because she realizes the mountain rescues rather than traps, therefore she offers to teach instead of steal, and Thessaly is released. The Library’s relocation rule is taught early and pays off when Mira’s offer—reconfiguring the rescue premise—literally brings Thessaly up the stairs. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the mountain keeps its shame-shelves, Mira leaves pledged to a lifelong pedagogy she may never finish. Minor time-traveler convenience (seventeen loops off-page) is the only causal shortcut, not enough to ding the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spiral granite shelves, ozone-scorched coat, and dream-petals are sensuous, selective, and filtered through Mira’s botanist gaze. Space remains coherent even when shelves materialize; the nautilus metaphor guides orientation. The mountain-as-mind metaphor is riskily abstract, but the “shelves its bones” line anchors it physically. No single object constrains the final choice, capping at 8.8 per 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Thessaly—tightens when Mira learns retrieval itself is the violation. One meaningful reversal: rescue missions are the aggression, not the solution. Cost is legible: Mira forfeits the right to leave unchanged, accepting an unmeasurable teaching debt. The off-page time-traveler warning slightly blunts her agency (he initiates the renegotiation prompt), holding the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ignored wisdom only re-enters the world when the seeker becomes the messenger, not the owner. The unheard symphony motif threads from impossible languages to Mira’s final spoken roots, reconfiguring silence into sound without a moralizing paragraph. Conceptual repricing lands when the mountain’s “greatest shame” is revealed as humanity’s, not its own. Ambiguity remains: we feel the cost of Mira’s promise but have no proof the world will listen—exactly the right unsettled resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder with botanist precision—“petals pressed flat from gardens that would never exist”—and flexes into lyric compression under pressure. The time-traveler’s voice is distinct: clipped, regret-tinged, future-burned. No head-hopping; temporal displacement is signaled through sensory cues (ozone, scorch). Rhythm accelerates into single-clause bursts as shelves shift, mirroring heartbeat. Closure retains coherent perceptual signature: Mira’s final line of root-speech reads as both surrender and conquest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; opening nautilus simile teaches the spiral logic that recurs at closure. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing of rescue itself”) barely stays within POV’s scholarly lexicon. One paraphrase loop—“rescues them… It rescues them”—is noticeable but does not obscure causality. Figurative density spikes in the climax yet remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rescue-mission inversion feels inevitable yet fresh: the mountain as reluctant guardian of refused wisdom. Dream-botany coordinates and the mobile library of human refusal synthesize fantasy with epistemic critique without slipping into allegory. Thessaly’s gray hair and accumulated diaries particularize the abstract premise. Risky temporal-cosmic frame (time traveler, living mountain) is fully owned; no retreat to metaphorical safety.</comment>
