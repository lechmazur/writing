<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—shadows as “loyal hounds” re-casts her burden in the final paragraph—but the moment of self-inclusion is narrated rather than dramatized; we watch her realize instead of feeling the micro-choice that proves the shift. The keeper’s dialogue delivers diagnosis (“You feed them your own compassion”) that borders therapeutic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost. Still, the contradiction between carrier-of-darkness and recipient-of-mercy is legible and tracks to closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: mirrored glimpses build density until the crystal reconstitutes, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kira’s inclusion in her own circle of care. Causality holds: fragment warms → mirrors show → crystal fuses → stance shifts. Keeper’s off-stage knowledge is the one soft pivot, but the final image (“shadows trailing like loyal hounds”) crystallizes cost under the inferred lens. Closure is on-page and felt.</comment>

<comment>Ice-groaning cliff, salt-dusted apple limbs, and the brass-oval mirror give tactile anchors; the lighthouse interior is sketched only as backdrop for the mirrors, satisfying micro-setting economy. Weather and terrain stay causally present—salt spray, shifting floes—mirroring Kira’s frozen self-exclusion. Final beam sweeping the orchard recharges the opening image, locking setting to theme. No orientation drift; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Kira reclaim the compassion she externalizes? Pressure escalates via accumulative density—each mirror adds a self-kindness she has disowned—until refusal is no longer viable. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction tightens once, foreclosing continued self-neglect with visible cost (shadows re-homed). Sufficient for 600-word frame, though a mid-scene micro-choice rather than declarative realization would have sharpened the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—peace as presence of connection, starting with self—emerges through mirrored acts rather than sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: accepting the glowing crystal equals accepting her own wounded light. Final orchard image answers the thematic question without moralizing. Keeper’s line “peace isn’t just the absence of conflict” is the closest to overt thesis, but it precedes the final image and feels earned by accumulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Kira’s perceptual filter: salt-crystal breath, shadows pooling at boots, fragment pulsing “against her heart.” Syntax lengthens under emotional swell, then clips at the keeper’s pronouncements, showing rhythmic control. No head-hop; keeper’s interior remains opaque. Distinctive diction—“gnarled apple trees dusted with salt spray”—creates a salt-bleached lyric texture that doesn’t obstruct clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + image) with minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“shadows rippling… like loyal hounds”—is purposeful and paid off. No filter-verb stacks, no loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reverent,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register without register drift. Clean copy; pronouns track; final paragraph lands with cadence that re-illuminates prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is fresh staging for a peacekeeper’s self-reckoning. Mirrors as empathy archive reweights a familiar “learn to love yourself” arc into speculative texture. Shadow-carrier premise avoids generic chosen-one tropes by tying darkness to volunteered empathy-debt. While the core insight isn’t unprecedented, the salt-stung mirror mechanic makes the resolution feel specific rather than interchangeable.</comment>
