<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is concrete—her palm on the resonator, the coin against light—but her one decisive act is the spoken question; the rest is receptive. Contradictory impulses (scientist vs. wonderer) are named rather than enacted in body. The “methodically playful” trait is asserted, not demonstrated through micro-choices that cost her anything visible. Closure is an internal shift without prior tactical struggle, so the cost feels conceptual rather than earned on-page.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each sonic panel adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Anchors arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she sees herself seeing—with conceptual cost: restorer becomes restored. No causal break; the question–pause–reply structure is taught early and paid off.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is rendered through brass, copper, mist, and trembling metal—tactile and selective. The hobo nickel and resonator panels act as micro-settings that constrain her next move (she pockets the coin, steps between reflectors). Sensory hierarchy obeys her restorer eye: pigments → frequencies → etched bronze. Final image is charged by the skylight glint on the coin, re-using an earlier anchor.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she awaken the self-portrait or remain defeated? Pressure tightens when every prior frequency fails; the question is her last gambit. Escalation is accumulative—each failed sound adds weight to the silence that follows. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits expert certainty for perpetual curiosity; the doorway forecloses closure on the artist’s face.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the nickel’s transformed meaning (currency → mythology) mirrored in the mural’s transformation (sound → image → self-portal). No explicit thesis; the final image reprises “listen with her eyes,” reprising the opening line. Ambiguity is purposeful: the portrait is both personal and universal. Epiphany is earned through tactile experiment, not stated wisdom.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays tight to Margot’s perceptual filter: “inner ear swim,” “crude carved grooves.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then shortens at the reveal (“Nested awakenings, she thought”). No dialogue, so voice is carried by weighted nouns (“resonator,” “hobo nickel”) and sonic verbs (“trembling,” “bewitch”). Register stays within her restoration lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long cadence for garden description, staccato for failed trials, then open vowels for the reveal. Metaphors stay sonic (sound “bloomed,” mist “rippling”) and cohere. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or interiority. Opening and closing lines form a circular resonance, reinforcing lyric design without repetition.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—mural painted with sound that only appears under wonder—feels fresh yet inevitable. The hobo nickel as personal mythology dovetails with the garden’s sonic myth-making. Nested self-portal avoids gimmick because it grows from earlier failed attempts and the coin’s iterative carvings. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure image that reweights the whole花园.</question>
