<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s precognitive amnesia is dramatized through embodied ritual—chalk dust on fingers, driftwood arrows—so the flaw actively shapes every beat; the final renunciation (“the forgetting was mercy”) is earned because we have watched him physically exhaust the one tool that channels his curse. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into diagnostic labels. The only bar to 9.0 is that the loss of the chalk feels pre-ordained rather than a choice that costs him an alternative path we can name on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chalk map of future partings reweights the premise—knowledge itself becomes unbearable—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. The driftwood trail and dissolving fog teach the pattern early; orientation is never in doubt. Cost is legible in the final image of the phone photo already corrupting, proving the rule that prophecy erases itself. No causal break or soft reset mars the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fog sculptures act as mutable setting-cum-antagonist: their dissolve constrains Marcus’s window to act and literally erases the map he writes. Driftwood, chalk, and stone are micro-settings that bear the weight of choice; the chalk stub’s diminishing length is tracked in tactile detail. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt-bleached wood, chalk dust, tidal hush—never tourist catalog. Environment never stalls momentum; each descriptor advances the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it forgets itself”—is signaled early and tightens through the irreversible consumption of the chalk. One meaningful deepening: the map reveals future losses, raising the price of knowledge from personal confusion to anticipatory grief. Agency is present yet circumscribed: he writes because he must, but the act exhausts his only tool, foreclosing further prophecy. Cost is visible on-page; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that mercy and cruelty are fused in forgetting: the same erasure that torments Marcus protects him from unbearable foresight. The fog sculpture’s final shift to “almost like his mother’s face” reweights earlier videotape imagery without moralizing. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of corrupted static is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—should we envy or pity his amnesia?—yet remains coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is saturated with hush, salt, and videotape static—“the particular silence of moments recorded but never played back.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with Marcus’s fugue states, teaching the reader the rhythm of memory loss. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within the lexicon of a coastal salvage prophet; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “He followed these fragments the way a deaf man might follow vibrations” does double duty as metaphor and stakes clarification. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalties. Opening and final lines are image-anchored, not abstract. A single paraphrase loop—“already unsure why he had arranged them, already feeling the vision slip”—is deliberate echo of theme, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The precognitive-amnesiac junkyard prophet who writes prophecies he will forget is a fresh synthesis; the fog sculpture garden as living, erasing medium is a literalized metaphor that feels inevitable once met. Risk—lyric, almost static scene—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Removing any core element (chalk, fog, amnesia) collapses the entire logic. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications to the last corrupted pixel.</comment>
