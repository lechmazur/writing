<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her “logically emotional” filter drives every beat from risk calculus to the fatal resonance. The key pressed to her sternum, her pulse-counting, the step-by-step hum tweak all externalize motive with embodied cost. No secondary character pressure is available, so crucible and status dynamics are N/A. The final dispersal is earned because earlier adaptation obsession is weaponized against her; the causality is clean, the cost absolute.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: discovery ➔ skiff commandeer ➔ resonance entry ➔ molecular unmaking, each step a therefore linkage. Orientation anchors—who (engineer Vera), where (drift-ice marina), when (twenty-minute sunset window)—arrive before 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the Tone’s global release reweights the premise—absolution is now atmospheric and un-commodifiable, paid for by her corporeal erasure. Persistent constraint: only her key + lineage can open, only her body can become conduit; both shape tactics to the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice maze, skiff hull scrapes, crystalline bell interior—details are filtered through Vera’s lighthouse-engineer gaze (sound as data, light as vector). The azure coat and braided leather key cord function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and reappear in the final image. Cold physics stay consistent; sunset window tightens spatial and temporal choreography. No exposition dumps; environment is discovered through goal-directed action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent commodification of absolution—signaled in paragraph four and tightened when recovery lights appear. One meaningful escalation: Vera shifts from hiding to self-annihilating dissemination, foreclosing all other options. Cost is visceral: cellular unmaking paid on the page (“she felt herself becoming less solid”). No coincidences resolve; the Consortium’s approach merely complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of freeing the intangible by surrendering the body. Subtext operates through silence: the bell’s unread script, the fishermen’s wordless forgiveness. No ethical sermon—absolution remains an atmospheric fact rather than a moral. Final image reweights the opening cold commerce into shared resonance without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature—sound as frequency data, color as navigational code. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragmentation under molecular stress: “fleshly and ethereal simultaneously.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction stays within her plausible STEM lexicon; metaphor vehicles (tuning fork, ripple) are physics-based and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density high—one line often layers sensory data + emotional calculus. Figurative language is sparse and paid off (“mournful whales” echoed by bell’s release). Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; pronoun references unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses arctic infrastructure, family relic, and sonic theology into an inevitable whole. “Sonic absolution” transcends gimmick because the physics of resonance literally disassembles the protagonist. Risk—lyric dissolution of body into global sound—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The particularized setting and vocational lens make the tale unswap-able with generic fantasy.</comment>
