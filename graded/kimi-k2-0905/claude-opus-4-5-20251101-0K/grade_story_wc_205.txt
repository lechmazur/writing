<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—ex-revolutionary hunger versus scholarly remove—stays alive in every micro-choice (uncovering the mirror, pressing the shard to glass). The shift from cataloguer to participant is earned: her revolutionary fire is re-kindled by the temporal sight of her younger self and the civilization mid-departure. Embodied emotion is strong (“crystal shard pulsed in her palm like a heartbeat remembering itself”). Cost is visible: she forfeits academic safety and corporeal continuity. Only flaw: the moment of stepping through is summarized, not dramatized, so the final micro-choice feels slightly telescoped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the asteroid becomes doorway, not tomb, and Maren’s passage re-weights the entire premise. Causal chain holds: shard as key is set up → mirror ritual → temporal sight → stepping through. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4; no debt. One causality bump: “the vase shard wasn’t a fragment… it was a key” is declared, not discovered through action, but the image is paid off immediately. Cost is legible—she vanishes from the academic frame, notes scattered—so Earned Stasis is satisfied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid is not backdrop; its spirals “catch temporal flow like a sail,” directly enabling the climax. Micro-setting (crystal shard, uncovered mirror) constrains the final tactic—only through their physical interaction does passage occur. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Maren notices gilded arches, ignores mineralogy. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather (temporal storms) directly affects action—covering/uncovering mirrors. Setting thus charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—join or lose the vanished civilization—is signaled early (“she wanted only to understand”). Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: uncovering the mirror forecloses scholarly detachment and triggers physical dissolution into the temporal stream. Cost is visible—her body disperses, research notes abandoned. Agency is hers; no coincidences resolve plot. Could edge higher if the council’s opposition had pressed her in-scene, but off-page antagonists keep pressure abstract yet still coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from specific paradox: to preserve a world you must abandon the act of preserving. Subtext is carried in mirror/reflection imagery—she literally steps through her own image to escape archival death. Final poem re-weights earlier verses without moralizing; sorrow remains burnished, unresolved. No thematic echo clichés. Ambiguity lingers: is she refugee or conqueror in the temporal stream? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice is consistent, with patterned diction (“baroque asteroid,” “burnished sorrow”) taught early and paid off in final poem. Syntax mirrors temporal glide—long, winding sentences calmed by fragmentary beats. Perceptual signature is specific: Maren sees “faces like polished amber,” counts “cold spaces.” No dialogue, so voice never contaminates. Register stays within her poetic-academic lexicon; no corporate drift. Rhythm modulates—short final poem acts as heartbeat stop—charging closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers image, backstory, and world rule (“baroque asteroid… carved into impossible spirals… civilization once breathed”). No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (temporal flow = wind, architecture = sail). Minor scaffold: “three standard years” appears twice in quick succession (−0.2). Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Strong verbs (“drifted,” “carved,” “sailed”) replace modifiers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: archaeology as revolutionary act—overthrowing death by stepping into it. Temporal architecture-as-sail is a non-obvious, inevitable metaphor once revealed. Risk of lyric summary over scene is taken but paid off via mirror dramatization. No trope recycling; “ex-revolutionary” is retooled from barricades to metaphysics. Specific detail (crystal shard catching “captured lightning”) prevents generic anywhere-setting. Transformation test passed: plot collapses without baroque/temporal premise.</comment>
