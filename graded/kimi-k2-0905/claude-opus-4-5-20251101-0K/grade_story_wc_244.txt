<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s “vanishing before gratitude can pin her down” immediately anchors her flaw; the moon-rock hand-off and the fox chat dramatize jocular loneliness under pressure. The final beat—offering to stay—trades her trademark elusiveness for visible cost, earned by the string of favors she once only facilitated. Interiority stays concrete (“the words unfamiliar and terrifying”) rather than diagnostic. Minor slip: Okonkwo’s neurologist résumé is told, not shown, diluting secondary-character pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s offer to “help distribute” reweights her lifetime rule of detachment, cost signaled by “gentle chains of reciprocity” that “felt… like freedom.” Causal lens holds: every favor she accepted (Nepal→Bangladesh→Honduras→Philippines) tightens the noose of debt that finally binds her. Orientation is clean by line 10; single-scene default met. One micro-turn (fox returns with companion) prefigures her own acceptance, tightening without overt coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ivy as living shroud, moon rock under fractured skylights, fox duo in ticket booth—each image is tactile and filtered through Maya’s disaster-trained eye. The station’s dereliction mirrors her emotional abandonment while supplying the secret lab’s cover. Micro-setting rule met: the overgrown platform constrains her movement (she must sit on a trunk) and charges the final image of “plants never stopped reaching.” Only gap: no smell or temperature cue at the climax to fully exploit sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Maya let herself be known?”—is signaled early and tightens once: from courier to co-architect of the cure. The ivy’s slow engulfment literalizes growing pressure; her offer to distribute the compound is an irreversible trade of anonymity for connection. Cost is felt (“unfamiliar and terrifying”) but could be sharper—no immediate resource or timeline lost on page. Escalation is coherent under the causal lens, not luck-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: “loneliness is the disaster no one calls me to fix” reframes relief work as self-denial. The favor-economy concept reweights altruism as covert self-repair, culminating in the fox pair mirroring human need. Final image of ivy reaching toward “what it was for” offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thesis statement; only micro-flaw is Okonkwo’s spoken tagline that flirts with overt thematizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s logistical gaze; diction like “logistician,” “relief camps,” “airlifted” remains inside her lexicon. Rhythm accelerates at the hand-off, then exhales into lyrical final paragraph. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Okonkwo’s “quite hostile without regular negotiation” is scientist-gardener hybrid; Maya’s quip about the vineyard is jocular armor. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. Voice could edge higher with more idiosyncratic syntax under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic drumbeat. High density: “stolen, technically, though she preferred borrowed” compresses ethics in one line. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“living shrouds,” “gentle chains”—never overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun tracking clean across fox/antecedent. Only micro-slip: “improbably, a laboratory hummed” skirts scaffold adverb, but immediacy recovers next clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Favor-network grown inside disaster zones feels freshly spliced with lunar-neuroscience; trope of moon rock becomes social catalyst rather than MacGuffin. Maya’s reverse-ark trajectory—saving others to stay exiled—flips standard redemption arc. Ivy-strangled station as covert lab is specific and memorable. Risk: concept could read as twee, yet grounded logistics (antibiotics, airlift, rubble search) keep it urgent. Transformation test passed: swap moon mineral for any token and the social circuitry collapses.</comment>
