<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured—his “cosmic ledger” belief and ghost-metaphor self-conception feel specific—but the on-page micro-choice that proves the “respectfully rebellious” trait is only alluded to (bending rules until they “hum”) rather than dramatized. The final smile and walk into the gap register as a credible renunciation, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied. Secondary pressure from the daughter is present, but the relationship crucible is one-directional—she receives, he transmits—so the emotional risk lands lightly on him. Still, the hierarchy of values (promises over safety) is legible and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “a ghost made of promises” reweights the premise and leaves the cost—perpetual erasure—in the reader’s mind. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “gaps” and “absences” tightens through recurrence rather than causal chain. One soft spot: the Orientation Test is waived because the twilight/arcade disorientation serves the final ghost-image, yet the phrase “neither the Eastern Authority nor the Western Coalition officially claimed” is the only geopolitical anchor and arrives late (~word 80). No因果 break, but the world-rule for drone sensors is told, not tested on Marcus’s body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cobalt neon arcade functions as micro-setting that supplies the “brittle hush” tone and the color keynote for the final ghost-image; the vintage cabinets’ silence mirrors the enforced hush of surveillance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Marcus notices space and sight first because he navigates by visual gaps. The “swirling gray clouds” inside the jar achieve object-as-setting and constrain the hand-off beat. Weather is bottled, not ambient, yet it still affects action when the daughter presses it to her chest—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivery of bottled grief across a surveillance grid—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each repetition of “absence” tightens the texture of invisibility rather than narrowing external options. The midpoint deepening (learning the letters were intercepted) reweights the mother’s silence but does not force Marcus to alter tactics; it confirms stakes rather than raising them. Cost is conceptual—perpetual ghosthood—rather than a tangible loss on the page, keeping the score sub-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of presence: what is unseen carries the most weight. The bottled storm reconfigures from meteorological curio to compressed maternal sorrow without exposition. Final image of “ghost made of promises” offers a resonant, non-literal answer—reader must supply the unpaid cost. No overt moralizing; the cosmic ledger idea is borderline thematic echo but is embedded in Marcus’s idiom early, so the deduction is minor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a mournful, rhythmic cadence—“stepping only where nothing watched”/“ghost carrying grief”—that teaches its pattern by the third sentence and sustains modulation under pressure. Diction stays within Marcus’s plausible lexicon: “bureaucratic indifference,” “cosmic ledger.” The brittle hush tone is consistent; syntax stretches for lyric effect but never collapses into drumbeat monotony. Perceptual signature is strong: surveillance geometry rendered as negative space, grief as bottled weather.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often do triple duty (anchor, mood, world-rule). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent—“lightning like dying fireflies” sustains the bottled-death conceit. One mixed image: “bending every rule until they hummed” is sonically pleasing but physically vague, a hairline slip. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing knowledge or charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of smuggling via “absence” rather than presence is fresh and fully committed to; it flips the usual spy-thriller beat of outrunning sensors. Bottled weather as grief container feels mythic yet specific to this world. Risk is taken in the lyric, ghost-outcome ending rather than a thriller payoff, and coherence holds. Minor deduction for echo of familiar “letters never arrived” trope, but the inversion of surveillance geometry and the negative-space choreography transform it enough.</comment>
