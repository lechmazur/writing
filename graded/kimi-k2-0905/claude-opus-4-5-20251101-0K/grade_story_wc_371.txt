<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her noticing compulsion is embodied in the bread-handling and seed-planting beats. The contradiction between rage and tender patience is held in scene, not alternated in summary. Final renunciation (“stopped expecting answers”) is earned by the causal chain of planting against erasure; cost is visible in her solitary continuation. Voice stays particular, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mei plants the wheat, accepts the burden of memory, and the path forecloses with felt cost (“she only expected to keep asking”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of vanishings intensifies until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props or causality breaks. One reflective block stays under 20 % and tilts present choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tea-house micro-setting constrains every move: frost on roses, spider web, chipped cup all filter through Mei’s selective attention and charge the final image. Wild courtyard’s proximity dictates the guerrilla gardening tactic; soil temperature affects timing. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and smell (stale bread, cold soil) over visual catalog. Proper-noun economy: only “Chen Family Bread, Est. 1923” is named and reused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refuse participation in collective forgetting—tightens once when she plants the extinct wheat; option to simply mourn is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates via listed disappearances; final planting is the visible price. No coincidence resolves; spider web micro-turn mirrors her patience without rescuing her. Cost legible: bread is consumed, seeds irrevocably buried, solitude confirmed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as moral resistance—emerges from bread, seeds, and spider, never stated. Final whispered bakery name reweights earlier list of erasures without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: wheat may never grow, yet act itself is sacred. Subtext in “tenuous absolution” is enacted, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mei’s perceptual signature—jasmine scent, creeping fig, ghost-sweetness of bread. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during dig: “She knelt… began to dig.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her lexicon (“heuristically gentle” is her self-note, not authorial intrusion). No dialogue, so voice contamination absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and precise—“ghost of its original sweetness,” “courtyard held its breath.” No mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are clean; each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Proofing clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vanishing-culture trope is refreshed through guerrilla gardening of extinct wheat; bread-as-archive feels specific to this narrator. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final image. Transformation test fails if bakery name or wheat variety changed—details are irreplaceable. No derivative premise penalty; lived detail overrides template.</comment>
