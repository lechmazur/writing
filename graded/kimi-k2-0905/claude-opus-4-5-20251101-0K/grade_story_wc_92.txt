<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s vigilance is credibly lived-in—keys at belt, seventeen years of routine—but the story withholds any moment where that vigilance actually wavers or costs her something on the page; the “small smile” is the only visible interior shift and it arrives after victory, not during risk. Her calm inventiveness is asserted rather than dramatized (no on-scene improvisation). The twelve recruited conspirators remain off-stage, so relationship pressure and status crucible are absent; the story leans on summary monologue instead of embodied contradiction under tension. Still, her locked-silent stoicism feels consistent and the final renunciation—continuing to play loyal jailer—carries a muted, believable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is crisp: quill-holder numbers → sundial angles → evidence packets → engineered blackout → messengers galloping through gates Maren unlocked. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the revolution is now unstoppable yet her own life is frozen in renewed servitude; the cost is felt in the image of her returning to post with keys that no longer protect the Duke. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (Eastern Gate, twilight, Maren on duty). The only mild lag is a mid-section expository block (~160 words) that summarizes three months of decoding; because it feeds directly into the causal payoff, the lag is tolerable and does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thousand glass panels catching dying sun is an immediate, camera-ready image that later flips from beauty to surveillance liability once the blackout hits. Micro-setting of the Astronomer’s Tower (loose stone, hidden complete sundial) constrains the final move and literally “completes the circuit,” qualifying as a tool/setting hybrid that charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean: stairs, courtyard, gate, stables tracked without drift. Sensory economy is biased toward sight, appropriate for a lamp-less night, but other senses are invoked only once (hoof-beats); a second non-visual cue would have lifted the score into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the counterfeiting mint—signals early and tightens when Maren places the quill-holder in the hidden sundial, flipping her from clandestine decoder to active saboteur; this act forecloses retreat. Agency is present but quiet: unlocking gates, leaving doors ajar, placing the bronze piece—each micro-act raises personal exposure. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: lifelong identity as loyal sentinel is now hollow; score capped at 8.3 because the price is stated narratively rather than dramatized in a beat that shows her feeling the loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of borrowed vs. generated light emerges organically: the fort’s “luminosity” is sun-dependent surfaces, whereas true sparks come from internal friction; this is repriced in the final line without sermonizing. Subtext runs on silence—hoof-beats fading, lamps flickering back on—so the revolution’s meaning is carried in images, not speeches. No thematic echo sentences; the closest is the narrator’s “sparks—true sparks—came from friction,” which is acceptable because it is embedded in a metaphor already seeded by glass and sundial. Complexity is preserved: Maren’s victory is also self-erasure, leaving moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices keys, angles, loose stones, unrecognized footsteps—never the Duke’s interior. Diction is controlled, slightly elevated but consistent with a vigilant, self-schooled sentinel (“lens through which she saw the world”). Rhythm grows clipped during ascent—“She climbed the tower stairs... warm against her thigh”—then relaxes into the final luminous sentence, mirroring her release of tension. No head-hopping; no filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles (glass as gold, sparks as friction) stay coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Opening sentence is arresting and propulsive; final sentence re-casts “luminous” and “sparks” with new conceptual weight, satisfying the callback test. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop mid-story (“the astronomer had discovered... the astronomer had been calmly inventive”) is minor enough to deduct only −0.1. Figurative language is spare but precise; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean: no homophones, tense slips, or pronoun drift. Information density is high—every paragraph either advances conspiracy or reweights imagery.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Revolution-via-sundial-cipher is a fresh inflection on the familiar “castle conspiracy” template; the angle-code mechanic is specific, low-tech, and memorable. The lock-sentinel POV is an unusual vantage rarely centered in palace-intrigue plots. Transformation test passes: changing Maren’s occupation would break the causal logic (she alone controls every lock). Risk is present—quiet sabotage instead of sword-clash—but executed confidently rather than gimmicky. Score capped short of 9 because the core revelation (counterfeiting mint) is a standard tyrant trope given new trim, not wholesale reinvention.</comment>
