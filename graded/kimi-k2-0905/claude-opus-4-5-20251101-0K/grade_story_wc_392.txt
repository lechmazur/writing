<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margaret’s investigative posture is vivid—her palm on the tunnel wall, flashlight arcs—but the interiority slips into canned therapy-speak (“fortified vulnerability,” “associative recall”) right when the lantern’s flood hits. The moment of entangled memory is narrated rather than dramatized, so the contradictory impulse we need for 9-band is reported, not embodied. Still, her cumulative micro-choices (photograph, touch, promise) build to a credible renunciation with cost, satisfying the earned-stasis test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: David’s notes → sealed tunnel → lantern → contraband → resolution to expose. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—Margaret’s silent promise to the lantern reweights every prior beat with conceptual cost. The only drag is a 150-word reflective block that stalls forward pressure just before the alcove discovery; a micro-ellipsis would have tightened the ascent to the surface.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern is micro-setting that constrains the final choice and literally charges the image; the tunnel’s wet concrete, rusted bracket, and vibration under train pass spatially ground every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—transit investigator notes scuffs, falsified manifests, tool displacement. Weather (ended drought) mirrors internal relief without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose authority corruption—signals early and tightens when contraband containers narrow options to “document and leak or die.” Margaret’s agency drives every escalation: she decides to descend, to photograph, to promise dissemination. Cost is visible—risk of electrocution fate echoed. One beat of luck (lantern bracket still intact) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of buried passages—literal Underground Railroad, metaphorical cover-up—emerges from concrete images, never sermon. Lantern’s historical freight reweights the transit authority’s crime without authorial nudge. Final image of rain-washed night offers Conceptual Repricing: liberation and exposure fused. No echoing thesis line; silence after promise lets resonance breathe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crisp—Margaret reads infrastructure like a medical examiner, filters through occupational lens. Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences calm, staccato clauses under train vibration. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Diction stays within transit-worker lexicon except one slip to “conceptual repricing” meta-register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density—“pharmaceutical logos, falsified destinations” does triple work. One paraphrase loop (“tunnel hadn’t been built by the transit authority. It was older…”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; “history pressed against the present like a bruise” is precise and earned. Closure line is propulsive, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing contemporary transit-corruption thriller with Underground Railroad artifact is fresh synthesis; lantern as both evidence and moral witness feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—lyric intercut of historical memory—pays off by recharging final promise. Removing lantern collapses both plot mechanism and thematic core, proving irreplaceability. No derivative-template echo; genre conventions are subverted through historic specificity.</comment>
