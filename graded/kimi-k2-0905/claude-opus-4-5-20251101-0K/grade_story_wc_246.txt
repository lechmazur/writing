<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is laser-etched: the contradiction between her punitive exile and her residual scientific pride is enacted in every micro-choice (grabbing the dry pen to scribble equations on her palm). The causal chain from guilt → anomaly → rewrite is tight; her renunciation of self-punishment in favor of repair lands with felt cost (“she would never be entirely certain”). The only hairline slip is a single diagnostic tag—“confidently uncertain” used twice flatly—else the character would breach 9.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the Kepler sun brightens in real time, rewriting genocide into possibility. The causal lattice holds: anomaly folds time → future question arrives before past genocide → present edit broadcasts → star rebrightens. Cost is on-page: “she would never be entirely certain” and the pen set down “carefully” (a quiet stasis that forecloses the old guilt). Lens (Causal) is unbroken; the cross-cap for 9+ is met; no orientation debt; no artifact touches the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active agent: it folds causality, lets the radio question slingshot backward, and physically tilts the deck under Vera’s feet. The fountain-pen/meteorite iridium is micro-setting that constrains her last move—dry nib forces palm-scribble equations, charging the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true: she clocks “centuries-late starlight” and skips tourist catalog. One minor over-label of “impossible directions” keeps it from 9.3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—can she retro-absolve genocide—tightens in a single but decisive escalation: the arrival of the pre-causal Kepler question collapses her option space to one act: edit & resend. Cost is visible: the rebrightened star is paired with her permanent epistemic uncertainty. No coincidence resolves; anomaly mechanics were pre-established. The beat qualifies for 9+ under Causal lens with persistent constraint (time-fold remains, she stays uncertain).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—history as an editable palimpsest—emerges organically from the anomaly’s physics and her mentor’s aphorism, never sermonized. The final image (steady starlight) reweights every prior mention of “wrong seeds” without naming forgiveness. Subtext is carried in gesture: setting the pen down “carefully” performs apology more cleanly than dialogue could. One micro-lecture line—“interpretation was creation”—is the only overt cue, keeping it just shy of 9.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular: precise scientific diction braided with lyrical compression (“time folded like wet paper”). Psychic distance modulates—tight for palm-equations, mid for cosmic static—without head-hop. The dry-pen micro-movement is rendered in tactile, rhythmic shards that match anomaly shudders. No register drift, no filter-verb bloat; the final cadence lands with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense yet airy (“encoding it with what she believed was universal mathematics”). Metaphors are coherent (wet paper → starlight centuries late) and sparse enough to avoid purple fog. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold, zero template cadence. The single “impossible directions” is the only minor cliché; otherwise rhythm, tense, and propulsion are immaculate through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The causal-time-fold editorial redo is a fresh synthesis of SETI-guilt trope; the anomaly as literal revision studio weaponizes relativity for moral repair. The pen-from-meteorite is not quirky ornament but necessary tool: its iridium nib carries Okonkwo’s authority into the rewrite. Risk—treating genocide reversal as lyric pivot—pays off because cost (permanent uncertainty) is kept. The concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious; fulfills 9+ risk bonus.</comment>
