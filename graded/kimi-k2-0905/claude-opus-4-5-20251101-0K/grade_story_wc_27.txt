<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s barefoot choice and opera-glass ritual are concrete, character-specific beats that externalize her need to “listen” rather than fight; the internal contradiction between exhausted grief and stubborn hope is kept live in scene, not summarized. The final resolve to carry the “gift of perspective” to the camps is earned by the stone-circle vision, so her renunciation of despair carries visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are rightly absent; grandmother backstory is brief, cued by the glasses, and tilts her present stance. Micro-choices (pressing bare feet to grating, lifting glasses toward comrades’ fires) reveal value hierarchy without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stones reframe the lull as “breath held before the next note,” making the rebellion’s continuance feel inevitable and costly. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptor layer (rusted cranes, starlight through holes, barefoot cold) deepens the stake until the final image reweights it. Cost is unmistakable—“the cold metal grating beneath her feet no longer felt like discomfort but like connection”—a tangible price paid for the new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causal breaks or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is not backdrop but crucible: the punctured ceiling lets starlight “pour through like silver rain,” a visual that later reappears when Maya dons the mantle of stars. The ancient stone circle’s bone-aching hum is a lived constraint that forces her revelation; its prehistoric presence inside a mechanical cathedral dramatizes the theme organically. Bare feet on cold grating turn the floor itself into a sensory tool that tracks her shifting stance. Spatial choreography is clean—she walks from grating to cranes to circle to exit without impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“someone needed to remember why they had started fighting”—is signaled early and tightens when the stones’ hum forces a stance crystallization: continue as witness-carrier or stay in passive stargazing. The meaningful deepening is the shift from searching the sky for signs to pointing the glasses at her comrades’ fires; this narrows her options from cosmic to communal. Cost is felt: she will walk tomorrow “barefoot and bearing this gift,” accepting physical discomfort as the price of reignition. No coincidence resolves the lull; the stones merely reprice it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stones’ repricing rather than assertion: rebellions, like stars, can reignite from their own cold ashes. The opera glasses reframe from sky-gazing to people-watching, making the final image a quiet answer to the opening question of meaning. No moralizing paragraph; the last line keeps the thought in Maya’s gesture, not the author’s voice. The ambiguity of whether reignition will succeed is preserved, satisfying the “lingering without confusion” test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lensed on Maya; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—celestial metaphors, barefoot sensitivity, vintage-tool nostalgia—creating a distinct stargazer idiom. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer accumulative sentences during stone hum, crisp exit line at dawn. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are correctly bypassed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: tidal cadence during hum, short declarative at dawn. No figurative muddle; metaphors (starlight rain, silver mantle) extend rather than contradict. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, body, and concept without scaffold. Minor paraphrase loop “beautiful terrible mess” appears once but does not touch closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusion of prehistoric stone circle inside a spaceport repair bay feels fresh and specific; the juxtaposition is not decorative but drives the climax. Barefoot stargazer with antique opera glasses is an idiosyncratic image that would break if swapped. The “lull as breath” reconfiguration offers a non-obvious angle on rebellion fatigue. Risk is aesthetic rather than plot-clever, and it pays off in resonance.</comment>
