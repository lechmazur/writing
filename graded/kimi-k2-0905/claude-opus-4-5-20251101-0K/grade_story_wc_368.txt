<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Senna’s contradictory impulses—grief for her cruelty vs. hunger to inherit Mei-Lin’s gift—co-exist in the same beats, not in alternating summaries. The embodied shiver of the new heart when the light hits her hands makes the interiority visceral. The micro-choice to volunteer her hidden cruelty under the sun-band is a credible, costly renunciation of her old guarded life. Only the “quietly explosive” label is repeated without fresh embodiment, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Senna’s whispered confession reconfigures the meaning of the transplant from mere survival to inherited vocation, and the cost—public exposure of her worst memory—is on the page. Causal linkage holds: the morpho wing → dye master’s recognition → light beam → involuntary confession → decision to stay. Orientation is anchored by word 42 (“The tea house drifted…”) and the floating-stone rules are taught early and paid off at closure. No lens ambiguity; the final image of drifting toward “whatever stories waited” crystallizes the new epistemic stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tea-house-as-setting actively pressures choice: it drifts, so Senna cannot leave without deciding before the solstice. The crystalline east windows and indigo-stained hands are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered. The morpho wing micro-setting functions as a tool that literally refracts the light onto her hands, forcing confession. Only the valley’s physics (“ancient currents”) is sketched broadly, but this is within allowance for a single-scene 700-word piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she inherit Mei-Lin’s story-magnetism?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each sun ribbon tightens the noose of disclosure until the beam extracts her secret. The price—public confession—alters tactics (she commits to stay). No visible resource loss, so it stops just shy of 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stories are parasites that need a host heart and a willing beam of light. The morpho wing’s shift from pretty relic to map of future confessions reweights the premise. Final image—“drifting toward whatever stories waited”—offers resonant, non-literal answer: she has become the new lantern. No moralizing, no thematic echo sentence, just charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Senna’s medicalized, post-surgery body. Diction—“quietly explosive,” “iridescent caution”—is voice-motivated and re-used with变异, not repetition fatigue. Syntax modulates: longer ingressive sentences for wonder, fragment-like beats under the light’s pressure. No head-hopping; dye master’s dialogue is externally observed, not interiorized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence either advances knowledge or image. High density: “tethered to nothing but the ancient currents” does world, peril, and metaphor in nine words. Metaphors are coherent—light as memory extractor, wing as map—and never mixed. Rhythm breathes: the paragraph that ends with “blue fire” is a controlled crescendo that matches the heart-rate spike. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses organ-donor tale with solar-confession cosmology; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression (“the light remembered everything it touched”) is taught early and paid off. Specific detail—indigo-stained knuckles, sun-trail notebooks—prevents abstract drift. Not quite a 9 only because the “floating rocks” geography nods to established fantastical tropes without full inversion.</comment>
