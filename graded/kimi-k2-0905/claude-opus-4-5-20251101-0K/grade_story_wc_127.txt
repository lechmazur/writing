<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—numb dealer craving authentic feeling—drives every beat; the embodied “static electricity” gift and glycerin-drop detail keep her from abstraction. The final micro-choice (tucking the spent petal into amber) crystallizes her new permeability with visible cost. One slip: “affectionate detachment” is named, not dramatized, blunting the closing hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto darkness, tucked petal, and new professional stance reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. Causal chain (stolen inhale → crack → grotto return → petal gift) holds; no plot amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 60; single transition inside continuous scene. Persistent constraint—her electrical sensitivity—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Amber fractures, resin taste, and static-charge mapping turn the grotto into a second body that literally conducts her transformation; the spent petal left in a wall crack recharges the setting at exit. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors her professional bias for chemical emotion. Environment constrains the final gesture—only amber can preserve the petal’s trace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she still feel—tightens when the pure grief cracks her tolerance; the grotto descent forces the choice to inhale again, foreclosing sterile distance. Cost is legible: tear-streaked cheeks and the petal she can no longer keep. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed for lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of commerce: counterfeit dealer becomes patron of authenticity. Subtext lives in the petal’s molecular whisper—“You are not too far gone”—never authorially paraphrased. Final image of gifting the spent blotter reweights all prior sales into service. No moralizing sentence mars the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters every noun through chemical-emotional valence (“bergamot and vanilla and something heartbreaking”). Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens at decision—rhythmic control without monotony. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Vera’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—honeyed light, burning fragments—and pays off in the final amber dusk echo. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances knowledge or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“fractured,” “hemorrhaging”) replace modifiers. Clean copy, no tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Emotion dealer” and olfactory memory commerce feel fresh yet inevitable; the chemist’s compassionate molecular message is a non-obvious twist. Risk—lyric stillness instead of external showdown—heightens resonance without gimmickry. Transformation test: swap petal for any other object and the entire emotional circuitry collapses.</comment>
