<comment>Selene’s contradictory mix of custodial mentor and exiled outlaw is repeatedly embodied—her bare feet press “silent against the cold stones,” she both shields and endangers Kira. Kira’s hunger and hollowed memory are shown through her whispered request and steady extended arm, not labels. The final shared dance crystallizes their mutual cost: Selene surrenders her monopoly on exile, Kiranever belongs to the provinces again. Minor softness: Kira’s “first true smile” edges close to performed emotion; still, micro-choices (arm extended, trembling after inscription) keep motivation legible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the dancers’ dawn rechristens them permanently exiled yet cosmically anchored—cost felt in “never belong to the provinces again.” Causal chain holds: nostalgia ban → Selene’s exile → secret garden → Kira’s arrival → inscription → shared outlaw dance. One-shard default met; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Persistent constraint (moonstone ink, irreversible script) shapes tactics and final image. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the tide-and-moon rule-set reweights at the end with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Twilight garden’s “cold stones where starlight pooled like spilled mercury” is tactile and specific; body-as-setting appears when Selene’s own inscribed arms serve as living maps. The moonstone dust vessel recurs with evolving stakes—first relic, then ink, finally bond—constraining the inscription act that seals exile. Spatial choreography is clean: Kira emerges “between the obsidian pillars,” ends “together they wrote…across the stones.” Micro-setting (skin as parchment) charges the final image. Slight reserve: no environmental obstacle alters tactics, keeping it just under 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom from memory ban versus irreversible cosmic binding—tightens once: the moment Kira extends her arm, options collapse from seeking teacher to being marked forever. Escalation is situationally coherent: Magisters’ invisible threat hovers, but on-page pressure is the stylus burn and dawn deadline. Agency is Kira’s literal flesh offer; cost is “never belong…again” and permanent tide anchor. Coincidence absent; causality intact. Could wish for one mid-scene obstacle that further narrows tactics, hence 8.7 not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as bodily possession versus state erasure; dance as historiography. Subtext in Kira’s whisper—heard “you write on skin”—carries erotic-sacred charge beneath literal request. Final image of outlaw duet answers the thematic question: history survives only in outlaw bodies, not archives. No sermonizing; resonance grows from specific salt-ink on living flesh. Complexity maintained—exile is both loss and power—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet filters through Selene’s dancer-perception: starlight “pooled,” gaps “observed,” verbs like “trace,” “spiral” echo choreography. Syntax lengthens during dance, contracts at burn—“Kira gasped but held steady”—mirrors breath. No head-hop; Kira’s interior accessed only via Selene’s gap-reading. Diction stays within coastal-priest lexicon: “lunar phase,” “salt and motion,” never academic. Rhythm controlled: soft sibilants for tides, hard plosives for stylus burn. Experimental elision (cosmic verse unnamed) taught early and paid off at inscription.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template chains. Mixed metaphors avoided—“starlight pooled like spilled mercury” holds physical logic. Information-dense: one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“Here…beyond the Magisters’ reach, she practiced…”). Minor scaffold: “She remembered everything. She remembered because…” repetition deliberate but still loops; costs −0.2. No freshness issues in peak beat. Closure image clean. Overall propulsion high with only hairline loop preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Tide-dancer memory smugglers felt fresh yet inevitable; combines ban-on-nostalgia dystopia with body-as-manuscript magic. Moonstone dust as sacramental ink particularizes standard rebel-mentor trope. Final outlaw dance reconfigures familiar exile into chosen kinship, growing from established gaps rather than late twist. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off: closure legible, stakes higher. No echo of famous scenes. Transformation test fails if relocated inland—oceanic logic essential.</comment>
