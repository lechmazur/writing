<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Margaret’s grief-driven inventiveness is embodied and specific; the silent orchid-stem experiment makes her interior contradiction visible. The micro-choice to write the “gold” warmth of her own chest into notation shows earned change. No secondary character appears, so bullets 6-8 are waived; her solitude is the crucible. Cost is legible: she accepts a lifetime of external silence for an internal music only she can feel, a Charged Poise that forecloses audiophile return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tuning-fork strike thickens the thermal pattern until the final self-reading turns silence into visible music. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laptop’s golden pulse reweights prior frozen grief with a new sensory lexicon. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“winterglass conservatory”), well inside the 120-word grace window. Cost is unmistakable: she renounces the ocean’s auditory world and embraces a haptic future at the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystalline walls, frozen petals, and fogged handprint are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain movement (glass walls = no escape, frozen stems = fragile touch). The tuning-fork case reappears as “empty” at the end, charging the closure image with spent possibility. Sensory hierarchy is respected: vision and temperature dominate because hearing is gone. Environment and tool jointly force her final stance; without the conservatory’s preserved specimens the experiment—and thus the arc—would collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens when each fork strike proves the orchids can “speak” back. The escalation is accumulative: every new thermal signature deepens the same stake rather than reversing it. One credible loss is dramatized: she forfeits the chance to ever hear sound again when she smiles at the gold on her own chest. The final renunciation is visible; no coincidence is invoked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: survival through re-invention of sensory language. The orchid’s minor-key blues and the fern’s grief-cool blues accumulate into a private score that refuses sentimentality. Final image—her continuing to write—offers no moral, only the lived proof that meaning can migrate across modalities. No echoing thesis line; the gold laptop light is the repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, synesthetic: “spectral fragments,” “silence lived here naturally.” Rhythm accelerates with short beats during strikes, then lengthens into the final cadence of acceptance. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: precise diction (“thermal sensors arranged in careful grids”) braided with lyric metaphor (“fronds like frozen lace”). No dialogue, hence no head-hop risk. Final hummed vibration is felt, not heard—textbook POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, emotional register, causal push. No scaffold loops; each fork strike advances pattern. Metaphors are consistent—glass, ice, bloom—without muddled vehicles. Opening and closing lines act as brackets: “held breath” returns as Margaret’s own held breath while she writes. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “frozen” modifiers; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is bold: grief-deafness reversed via botanical thermography. The orchid-as-theremin is non-obvious yet inevitable once shown. Risk—renouncing sound forever—heightens stakes instead of gimmickry. Specificity (velvet case, quarter-note notation) prevents abstraction; no template echo of famous shipwreck tales.</comment>
