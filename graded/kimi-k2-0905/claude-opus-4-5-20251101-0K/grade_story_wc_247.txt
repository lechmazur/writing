<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory hunger for invisibility yet ache to be witnessed drives every beat; her camera-no-film quirk and embodied “vibrations through floorboards” memory give interiority that is concrete, not therapeutic. Elena’s quiet-charisma label is shown through political muscle—she learned sign to “understand what my politicians wouldn’t say aloud”—and the moment she risks that muscle by carrying silence into chambers. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when Mira trades her nightly solitude to teach mapping silence, forfeiting ghost-status for the harbor’s sake. Cost is felt: Mira will remain unheard while Elena’s new fluency may still fail—an Earned Stasis that forecloses mutual recognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each silence Mira catalogs thickens the port’s atmospheric stake until Elena’s request detonates it into action. Orientation lands cleanly by line 40 (who/where/when). Closure—Elena walking toward chambers with “silence like a torch”—is a Charged Poise that reweights meaning; the conceptual cost is legible: the harbor’s future now hinges on a language of gaps, not words. Causality is intact: because Mira taught, therefore Elena can attempt disruption, and Mira’s invisibility is the persistent price that shaped tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor as micro-setting constrains every move: moonlit planks serve as classroom, witness stand, and final pulpit. Camera, lighthouse cottage, and dock boards are handled, not toured; their texture returns in the closing image of Elena framed “against the waking harbor,” recharging prior motif. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies track from cottage shadow to shoulder-touch to departure. Weather-light shifts from “liquid silver” to “pink and gold” mark beat transitions and mirror internal stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the harbor—signals early through Elena’s whispered warning of demolition vote. One meaningful deepening occurs when teaching silence turns abstract hobby into political ammunition, narrowing Elena’s rhetorical options to a single risky gambit. Pressure stays textural: every practiced hand-shape increases the felt cost of potential failure. The price is on-page: Mira sacrifices her anonymity while Elena gambles her insider power—tactics visibly altered by the new linguistic constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: silence as music scored on water and skin. Subtext lives in gestural dialogue—Elena’s first sign both flatters and appropriates Mira’s life-work. Final image reframes “ghosts remembering each other” as the harbor’s true preservation, offering conceptual repricing without moral tag. No thematic echo; the insight stays implicit in the torch of silence Elena carries away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyracal third-person hovers at Mira’s perceptual frequency—“sheet of liquid silver,” “music waiting to be born”—syntax mirrors her tidal patience. Sign-language passages adopt telegraphic brevity, rhythmically distinct from surrounding prose, teaching the reader the pattern. No head-hop; Elena’s interior is surfaced only through observed gesture and dialogue, staying within Mira’s deaf POV. Diction stays inside Mira’s plausible lexicon while achieving poetic compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long wave-like clauses to staccato signing beats; no template cadence. Information density is high—one line can layer sensory cue, backstory pinch, and thematic seed: “I would feel the vibrations through the floorboards.” Figurative language is selective; when stacked (“quiet certainty of someone accustomed to going unnoticed”) it serves characterization, not ornament. Zero loops, zero scaffold; closing line lands with propulsive snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf flaneur tutors political fixer in silence-as-language to block condo creep—angle not seen before. Risk of lyric sign-language passages pays off by making reader complicit in learning silence. Camera-with-no-film repurposed from twee prop to ontology tool. Stakes stay localized yet feel universal; transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
