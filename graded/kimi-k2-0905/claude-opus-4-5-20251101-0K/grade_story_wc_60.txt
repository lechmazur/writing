<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “luminous skeptic” contradiction stays active—she distrusts magic yet guides the city with her own inner light—but interiority drifts into label-speak (“skepticism warred with hope”). The sacrificial release of her mother’s laughter is earned, yet the absence of any on-page relationship or status opposition keeps the arc intimate rather than crucible-tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: frozen geese → breadcrumb crystals → key → laughter solvent → fountains restored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: communal memory regained at the price of Mira’s private relic, signaled by the empty box. Orientation anchors arrive by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the amber spiral suffices, though escalation is gentle rather than fierce.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dry fountains, crystallized memory-amber, and the stained-glass box function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: only the laughter can melt the plug, and only the key fits the hidden slot. City geography stays schematic, but the central fountain basin’s amber whirlpool is tactile and stakes-driving, earning high-band per the gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore communal memory—is signaled early and tightens once: the laughter must be spent to unlock the wells. Agency is present (Mira guides the solvent), yet cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Escalation is coherent but single-staged; no secondary reversal or live option foreclosure occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: private memory must dissolve into public flow. The empty box’s final image reweights the value of hoarded versus shared past. No explicit moralizing; ambiguity remains—Mira gains the city yet loses her last mother-trace—yielding lingering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is light but consistent (“brushstrokes frozen on gray canvas”). No dialogue to test. Prose rhythm modulates with scene temperature—lyric frost vs. rushing release—achieving modest but effective voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; imagery is selective, not overwrought. No loops, filter-verb clusters, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“sidereal patience”) fits fairy-tale register without jarring. Information density is high; each paragraph advances stakes or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-fountain city and time-stopped geese combine into a fresh conceptual palette. The “laughter as solvent” twist feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than radical form—but the synthesis is specific enough to avoid stock fantasy gloss.</comment>
