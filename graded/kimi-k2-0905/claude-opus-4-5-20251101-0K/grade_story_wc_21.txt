<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Celeste’s interior contradiction—archive discipline vs. retrocognitive compulsion—drives every beat; the diary visions physically buckle her knees and dictate the trek. Each micro-choice (climbing the cargo hatch, kneeling at the lagoon, pressing record) visibly pays for truth with bodily risk and career suicide. The ending’s “fierce, bittersweet knowledge” crystallizes a costly renunciation of institutional safety earned by every prior vision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a classic Earned Stasis: Celeste gains testimony but forfeits scholarly neutrality; the cost is felt when she climbs back “carrying the weight of voices.” Causal chain holds: diary → visions → map coordinates → physical journey → testimony recorded; each because/therefore link narrows her options until only exposure remains. No teleporting data; the tube, cipher, and debris language all pay off on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon is handled like a living archive—reflecting sky and history—its glassy surface literally cuts Celeste’s knee, constraining her stance for recording. Zeppelin library’s restricted section and rusted fence supply tools and obstacles that shape access tactics. Micro-setting (beach-debris code) returns in the final circle of stones, reweighting the lagoon as a courtroom rather than a relic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—tightens with each decoded page until the only live option is to document Josefina’s proof in person. The lagoon confrontation re-stages the 2089 parley, forcing Celeste to choose between archival neutrality and witness; her recording device becomes the new driftwood message. Cost is visceral: dehydration, sun-scorch, and the irreversible breach of classified history.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through repeating imagery of unreadable surfaces—ciphered ink, black water, rusted fence—until the final image of recorded voices breaks the silence without preaching. “Truth in tension” reconfigures from intellectual ideal to embodied endangerment; the lagoon’s mirrored surface refracts both sky and surveillance, making secrecy impossible without verbalizing a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined metaphoric register—“clouds the color of old bruises,” “wound in the earth that remembered”—remains anchored to Celeste’s archivist precision. No head-hopping; Josefina’s granddaughter speaks in terse, desert-tested idiom that contrasts with Celeste’s cataloguing diction, marking status shift. Retrocognitive fragments compress time without confusing tense; patterned fragments taught early and paid off at final pebble circle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes with pressure: long, tide-like clauses in flight tighten to fragment bursts under desert sun, mirroring pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Figurative vehicles stay physically accurate—“beach debris as messages” sustains double duty as literal code and metaphor for silenced testimony. No register drift; “aquifer,” “pneumatic tube,” “retrocognitively” belong to Celeste’s professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing cli-fi, archival noir, and psychic time-travel into a seamless lyric argument feels genuinely new; the encrypted-ink-as-memory-virus premise flips standard found-document trope into embodied haunting. Beach-debris semaphore revives an unfamiliar historical protest code, making the lagoon a living archive that demands witness rather than excavation. Risk of retrocognitive info-dump is embraced and earned by grounding visions in physical cost.</comment>
