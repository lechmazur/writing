<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while craving absolution—are dramatized in the tactile ritual of pocketing the shard and the final press to her lips. The apology’s twenty-year inertia and the instant of its release are credibly linked by the moonlit condensation beat. Cost is visible: the word “Mama” is paid for with prior bodily and moral pressure. Interiority stays concrete; only the phrase “twenty years of silence crack inside her like ice in spring thaw” flirts with label-speak, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unsent letter becomes spoken apology, reconfiguring both filial guilt and medium’s vocation. Causal chain holds—moonlight → condensation → legible text → spoken word—each step narrowing options. The shard’s final pulse supplies persistent constraint and felt cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mangrove roots and moonlit clearing are not backdrop; they gate movement and literally surface the text that forces speech. The shard’s micro-setting—pocket to palm to lips—tracks spatially and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors brackish scent and stone taste, filtered through a medium attuned to invisible voices. Environment constrains the boat’s path and the apology’s timing, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she speak the apology—tightens once: from unread condensation to spoken “Mama.” The turn is micro but decisive, foreclosing silence. Cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the spirits’ cadence shift. Under Accumulative lens, the density of voices and moonlight escalates until speech becomes the only release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as inherited protection and prison—emerges through the shard’s journey, not exposition. Subtext hums in the spirits’ song: forgiveness is a medium’s message she must channel for herself. Final image of the boat parting mangroves offers non-literal answer: speech sets both mother and daughter free. No moralizing, only reweighted silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Celeste’s perceptual filter: rainspout edges “worn smooth,” moonlight “impossibly bright.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into the single-word whisper. No head-hopping; spirits’ dialogue is filtered through her chest vibration. Voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is selective—silvered voices, breath on glass—never clotted. One scaffold risk: “she had kept it without knowing why” repeats prior information, but beat advances to mother’s motive. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud cadence peaks at the whispered “Mama,” then subsides with the parting mangroves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines mediumship, gothic masonry, and mangrove-spirit limbo in a synthesis that feels inevitable rather than stitched. The unsent-letter trope is inverted: the dead read her withheld words back to her. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. While spiritual-labyrinth stories exist, the shard’s generational guardian angle supplies fresh inflection.</comment>
