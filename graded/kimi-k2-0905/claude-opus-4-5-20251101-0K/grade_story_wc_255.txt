<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting “true” sight even if it ruins her art—drives every beat; the plant-speech gimmick and “innocently cunning” label remain abstract, never crystallizing into a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. Her final laugh is earned, but the emotional climax is slightly over-articulated (“That was the beauty she’d always sought”) rather than embodied. Secondary pressure from Theo is present but static; he functions as cipher more than crucible. Still, the single, visible forfeiture of the reed tongue and the color-awakening keep the arc coherent and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the brass strip’s hot vibration on her eyelids delivers a Decisive Change with unmistakable sensory cost. Causal chain is tight—reed tongue → Theo’s condition → kneel → sight—each beat because/therefore. Orientation locked by line 3; no lens drift. One soft spot: the reed’s “single mournful note” is auditory sleight-of-hand that doesn’t alter tactics; it ornaments rather than tightens. Still, the final image of cracked flames reweights the premise and satisfies the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass courtyard anchors every beat; heat-pulse under palm, cooling slag colorfields, and furnace kneel all constrain body placement and ritual sequence. Micro-setting qualifies: the shard-strewn flagstones literally cut Mira’s knees and refract new light into her eyes. Jasmine and moonflower provide scent layer but stay background; no weather or spatial drift. The world rule—“phoenix fire lingers in objects”—is taught early and paid at climax, so the fantastical glow feels earned rather than wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“see what I’ve been missing”—is declared upfront and sharpened by Theo’s warning that sight may destroy her palette. Single meaningful tightening: the moment brass touches eyelids forecloses the safety of muted tones forever. Cost is visceral—tears, overloaded retinas, the word “exploded.” Agency is hers; she kneels, offers, chooses. No external antagonist needed; the risk is internal ruin, and it lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: beauty inheres in breakage, not wholeness. The glass shards’ refractive cracks reappear in the final canvas plan, reweighting earlier paintings as secretly “right” all along. No moralizing paragraph; the last line shows cracked flames rather than tells. Subtext in plant code is efficient but light; it never deepens the stakes. Still, the resonance is specific to Mira’s sensory awakening and avoids abstract platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays close to Mira’s synesthetic attention; perceptual signature strong—she “feels” color as heat before she sees it. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for courtyard catalog, staccato for visual explosion. Dialogue minimal but distinct; Theo’s register is cool oracular, hers pragmatic. No filter-verb stacks or head-hop. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” diction creeps into narrative once, but it’s brief and doesn’t contaminate voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is taut; sentences multitask—e.g., “glass remnants catching light she could only partially perceive” seeds both setting and handicap. Metaphors are clean (ash-and-amber sky) with no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “beauty in what others called imperfection” echoed twice in adjacent clauses; minor −0.2. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without over-explanation. No scaffold or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Color-blind painter trading grief for sight is fresh, but “phoenix-fire burns new senses” trope is familiar; the synthesis feels personal rather than photocopied. Plant-code communication is inventive yet under-deployed—could have constrained a beat. Risk taken: no villain, no reversal, just sensory overload as climax; the quiet payoff lands. Specific detail of concertina reed vibrating on eyelid is memorable and unlikely transferable.</comment>
