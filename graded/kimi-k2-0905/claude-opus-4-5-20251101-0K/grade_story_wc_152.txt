<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s “vacant sweetness” masquerade is vividthrough micro-choice—thread-spill as pick-pocket, corner-crawl eavesdropping—and her interior contradiction (trembling awe vs. cold cartography) stays embodied. The grandmother hand-off and eternal flame inheritance seed motive, but the leap to “three days to save the Queen” is asserted, not dramatized; cost is promised rather than felt. Because the final stance (smiling fool, needle moving) repeats the opening mask, we get Charged Poise, yet the absence of an on-page failure or irreversible sacrifice caps emotional depth. Secondary officers exist only as gossip clusters, so relationship crucible and status shift bullets are N/A—single-POV handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: whisper-clusters, thread galaxies, and flame-flickers accrue until pattern-break (red stitch = Queen) reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by word 60; causality is thematic collation rather than consecutive events, acceptable under lens. Closure is Charged Poise—Mira’s new panel crystallizes risk—but cost is conceptual (empire may burn) not personal; still, price is legible under rule-set. No meaningful escalation beat after the red stitch; tension plateaus, preventing 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt dome, copper ribs, lamplight on silk, and scattered thread-spools give tactile, eye-level specificity. Observatory functions as micro-setting whose acoustics and social stratification directly enable eavesdropping; autumn wind provides temporal anchor and mirrored spiral imagery. Eternal candle qualifies as charged object; its east-leaning flicker guides Mira’s attention, satisfying 9+ gate. Occasional cataloguing (“three centuries… naval fleet positions”) slips into exposition, minor drag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent palace purge—signalled late but retroactively charges every gathered thread. Pressure deepens through intelligence density: fleet positions → treasury nephew → dismissed guard; each new shard narrows options. Agency is attention-allocation rather than overt opposition; she risks exposure when spilling threads to reach battle map, visible micro-cost. Escalation is steady accumulation, not spike; lacks last-turn tightening that forecloses an escape route, keeping score sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—“history is stitched by hidden listeners”—emerges through image, never label; embroidery as espionage feels freshly particular. Final image of flame approving her new panel reweights prior domestic craft as national archive, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in officers’ dismissive laughter carries class contempt and imperial blindness. No late moralizing; only mild abstraction in “stories yet to be told” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira with perceptual signature—needle = compass, thread = star-chart. Syntax flexes from lyrical elongation to staccato mock-babble (“Always do, my lord”) without losing control. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect cleanly handled. Dialogue limited but differentiated: officers’ clipped conspiracy vs. Mira’s singsong submissives. No head-hopping or register drift; patterned elision (“syllables she collected like scattered pearls”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: winding sentences for stitching, clipped beats for eavesdropping. Information is dense—each thread color, fleet position, and name-drop carries double duty. Metaphors (coins of fate, stepping stones across dark water) are fresh and internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffolding: two “spiral” images near-open could compress; otherwise no loops or synonym churn. Closure line (“stories yet to be told”) is crisp, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—spy-galaxies embroidered in plain sight—feels novel yet inevitable; domestic craft retooled as cryptographic tech. Trope of “seeming fool” is revitalized via female textile labor rather than court jester. Specific detail—cobalt glass absorbing starlight, eternal candle pedigree—creates singular atmosphere unlikely to transplant unchanged. Risky accumulative structure (no chase, no violence) holds coherence under pressure. Synthesis of astronomy, needlework, and class invisibility earns high-band originality.</comment>
