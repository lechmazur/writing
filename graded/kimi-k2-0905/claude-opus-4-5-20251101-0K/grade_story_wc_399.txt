<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The walker’s “strangely honest” trait is shown only in dialogue tags, never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the mask-as-balance idea is evocative but never complicates her tactics. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory under pressure, so the final consecration feels pre-ordained, not wrested. Still, her peripheral-awareness gift is consistently filtered through bodily attention and anchors motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: prophet’s threat → descent to parapet → transfer → consecration → safe murmurs. The conjured clearing is foreshadowed by the humming marble and kinetic parapet, so the final sealing lands as earned Decisive Change with conceptual cost (ancestral voices now exiled to an invisible sanctuary). One minor loop: “the line walker understood” restates keeper’s stakes without new knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Silk panels, humming floor, and spiraling glyphs are tactile and POV-filtered; the kinetic parapet beneath sand functions as micro-setting that constrains her night-work. Spatial choreography is clear across the pavilion-dune-pavilion loop. The engine room is sketched with just enough sensory anchors to support the ritual beat without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the voices—is signaled early and tightened when torches appear; the transfer to clearing forces an irreversible trade-off (ancestral access now hidden). Pressure escalates through because/therefore links, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible personal loss would have pushed this into higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus silence emerges through the silk panels and the walker’s masked sight-line; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image of “whisperfield calm” reweights earlier murmurs into a quiet but charged poise. Subtext in keeper’s fluttering hands and prophet’s “certainty in his throat” efficiently encodes generational fear without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the walker’s perceptual quirks—peripheral vision, left-side mask, sand shifting underfoot—creating a distinct rhythmic signature. No head-hopping; prophet’s interior is rightly withheld. Syntax modulates from long lyrical cadences to clipped ritual commands, mirroring escalation without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“the walker understood… she had walked…”) slows the middle. Figurative language is selective—obsidian mask, fire in eyes—never stacked. Final line “next dying song that needed saving” provides propulsive off-ramp without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Memory-infrastructure built from silk and buried engines feels fresh; kinetic parapet as data-backup device reorients familiar “save the culture” trope. Risk is moderate—quiet ritual over conflagration—but the inversion of burning panels into immortalized whispers supplies a non-obvious payoff. Could push further if the walker’s mask imposed a sensory cost that complicated the ritual.</comment>
