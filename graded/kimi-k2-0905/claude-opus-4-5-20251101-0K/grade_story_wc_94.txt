<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory silence vs. need to speak is embodied in the trembling start-button press; the envelope-choice crystallizes a visible cost—seven lost years—landing as Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“storm-kissed wonder,” voice “raspy”) without diagnostic labels. Flaw: the mother photograph arrives late, so the filial wound feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each artifact (timer, timetable, photo) layers density until the 4:47 zero reweights options—she speaks. Causal chain intact: sealed note → photograph → decision. Closure satisfies CR with undeniable social cost—she re-enters the censors’ crosshairs. Orientation anchored by 70 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Copper dome, lightning alphabets, and the curved wall’s shadow letters are tactile, selective, and mirror Elena’s internal script. The storm supplies real-time percussion that paces her final spoken verse, charging the ending image. Micro-setting honored: the timer’s red digits function as navigable terrain under her thumb. One slip—“furiously tranquil waves” pushes weather into thematic pun territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—voice reclaimed—declared in para 1; tightening occurs when the timer’s countdown makes silence a live, dwindling resource. Agency visible: pressing Start, breaking wax, aiming telescope, choosing speech. Cost is specific and persistent: re-exposure to censorship. No coincidence; pressure escalates via because/therefore linkage under causal read inherited from accumulative build.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: images developed in darkness = dissidence preserved. Subtext in the father’s thumbprint-wax seal silently argues “inherit resistance.” Final image reframes scars as transit maps—conceptual repricing without moralizing. “Storm-kissed wonder” edges toward authorial cue but is absorbed by POV’s awe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustained; perceptual signature filters cosmos through photographic lexicon (“distant fires,” “electric wonder”). Syntax lengthens during reflection, contracts at choice beats (“She pressed”). No head-hop; psychic distance controlled. Idiom stays within Elena’s lyric-intellectual range; diction never drifts into textbook abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from thunderous cumulative clauses to single-word imperatives, echoing storm tempo. Figurative control high: lightning as alphabets, rage distilled atmospheric. Scaffolding minimal; one paraphrase loop (“furiously tranquil”) but self-conscious oxymoron fits theme. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Closing line lands clean with rhythmic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Framing censorship struggle inside obsolete observatory and darkroom timer feels non-obvious; synthesis of astronomy, photography, and poetry stakes is fresh. Specificity of discontinued bus-route #47 and thumbprint-wax resists swap-anywhere flaw. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; no gimmickry. Minor deduction for familiar “parent-letter-after-death” trigger.</comment>
