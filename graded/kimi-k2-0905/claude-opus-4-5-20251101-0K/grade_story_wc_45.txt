<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the contradiction between clinical certainty and the glowing tooth is felt in her body. The final decision—to excavate, document, and search—grows organically from her lifelong doubt and is paid for in the moment she forgives herself for not believing. Micro-choices (digging with bare hands, holding the hollow femur to moonlight) reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. The only slack is the single-beat appearance of the laughing child, which slightly dilutes the cost of her vow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Eleanor buries her skepticism and takes the path of search, with the felt price of never again enjoying the safety of disbelief. Causal chain holds: tooth → dig → hollow bones → vow; each step narrows options. Lens is Causal; “because/therefore” linkage is intact and rewarded at the end when the garden’s laughter confirms the world-rule she has just accepted. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“the hedge maze had grown wild…”), well inside the 120-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden under the apple tree is micro-setting at its best: night jasmine, moss-eaten marker, and hollow bones all constrain or enable the final choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—Eleanor’s knees in soil, femur lifted to moonlight, box snapped shut—each move tracked without drift. Weather (twilight → moonrise) times the beat shift. Only the hedge maze’s “closing behind her” skirts the edge of fairy-logic convenience, but it is taught early and pays off as thematic closure, so the gate for 9+ is missed by a whisker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove or disprove her mother’s fairy claim—tightens when the glowing tooth forces the dig. One meaningful turn: the hollow femur reweights the stake from “was mother mad?” to “how do I live in a world that is larger?” Cost is legible: she forfeits the epistemic safety that defined her medical identity. Escalation is protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of evidence itself: the same objects (tooth, bones) move from shameful delusion to priceless data. No explicit moral; the final image of the maze “closing behind her” reconfigures knowledge as labyrinthine rather than Euclidean. Subtext operates in silence—no fairy appears, yet their existence is affirmed. The emotional aftereffect is wonder tempered by irrevocable loss of certainty.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively medical, precise, and tactile—“puzzles of calcium and cartilage”—yet able to pivot to lyric registers without strain. Perceptual signature is doctorly: she notices fracture curvature, hollow marrow, moss edges. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Psychic distance tightens under pressure: from distant memory to present-tense kneeling in soil. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long reflective sentences in garden twilight, then staccato dig, lift, decide. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“honey left too long in the sun” is the single simile and it sticks. Opening and closing lines are mirror-bookends that re-charge the maze as both path and prison.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The changeling premise is familiar, yet the inversion—using a doctor’s rational toolkit to validate the supernatural—feels inevitable and fresh. Specificity of the hollow avian femur and opalescent tooth anchors the wonder in anatomical reality. Risk is taken: fairy lore is rarely paired with scientific methodology, and the synthesis succeeds without gimmick. Final reconfiguration (“science could expand to hold mystery without breaking”) offers a genuine conceptual re-pricing.</comment>
