<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and private ache are vividly particular; her choice to “speak of lighthouse lamps and insurance claims” crystallizes a value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“the cold seep into her,” “psychic residue that clung to warped glass”) and avoids label-speak. One missed beat: no embodied contradiction at the instant she decides to confront the council—only resolve—so the final cost feels announced rather than physically tasted. Still, the renunciation is causally earned and the flaw (compulsive communion with the dead) complicates every step.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira steps “into the waiting dark” cradling the globe, Elise steps through behind her—an irreversible reconfiguration of the veil. Causal chain holds: snow globe residue → dream pattern decode → harbormaster guilt → public exposure decision, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation anchored by line 3, no debt. The single soft spot: the lighthouse sabotage is inferred rather than dramatized, so the social cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on-page—barely short of 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glacier shrine, candle-amber on ice, warped globe—each detail is sensory, selective, and later weaponized (ice as “window,” globe as proof). The body-in-environment tension is missing; Mira kneels but we never feel her numb fingers altering her cognition. Still, the shrine constrains ritual pace and the globe’s “teardrop” silhouette reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give Elise witness—broadcast early and tightened once: from private ritual to public accusation. The escalation is purely informational rather than tactical; no time-lock or physical danger raises the cost, so pressure plateaus after the lighthouse revelation. Agency sits with Mira’s decision to speak, but the village’s reaction remains off-page, blunting the visible price. Sufficient for length, yet short of the 8.8 band that demands a felt toll on the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through recurrent images of borrowed/reflected light (“borrowed starlight,” “secondhand” starlight) and the globe’s transformation from souvenir to evidence. No explicit thesis statements; resonance arrives when the same secondhand light becomes enough—“it had always been enough.” Subtle counter-reading: justice may be too late, but visibility is its own mercy. Only minus: lighthouse greed motif enters late, so thematic braid is two-strand rather than triple.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “ice held memory,” “voices scattered across dreams.” Syntax lengthens in calm beats, fragments under trance compression, always purposeful. Zero dialogue removes voice-distinction risk; interior diction stays consistent and glacier-cold. Patterned elision (dream snapshots shuffled) is taught by line 5 and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; qualifies for 9+ if one more rhythmic surge had been timed to the final step onto snow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density: “candle flames that painted the glacier walls in amber and shadow” does three jobs in eleven words. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor cadence echo: “stepped through…waiting dark / stepped through” in last two paragraphs—intentional reverberation but verging on template. Does not obscure causality; closure image remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fuses ghost-whisper procedural with icy forensic archive; lighthouse-insurance fraud angle feels freshly exhumed from maritime record. Dream-portal mechanics avoid overdose of woo by grounding in villagers’ sleep journals. Risk taken: no on-page confrontation, yet the quiet egress with globe in cloth sustains poetic coherence. Transformation test fails only if Mira swapped with generic medium—her specific wreck-diving hunger is etched. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
