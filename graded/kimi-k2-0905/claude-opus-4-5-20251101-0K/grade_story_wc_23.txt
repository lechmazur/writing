<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a ruined station while rebuilding a beacon for ghosts—are embodied in blistered hands and the ache of sleeplessness. Her micro-choices (soldering mirrors, answering the phone, placing the censer) constantly re-rank her values: memory > survival, duty > escape. The final recognition of her own older voice lands as earned cost: she has sentenced herself to perpetual guardianship, a solitude foreclosed on-page. Interiority stays concrete, salty, and character-specific; no diagnostic shorthand intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure grows through pattern thickening (calls, mirror positions, lunar alignment) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—star-beams become a “path for loss itself,” reweighting grief into service; the cost is the lifelong watch she accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no orientation debt. The winter-solstice deadline and final self-call provide the decisive cadence shift required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The starlit signal station functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its broken hydraulics and salt-rotted lenses directly constrain what she can build and force the mirror-array solution. Patina-green bronze censer foot acts as portable shrine-anchor, handled in at least three beats, its changing weight charting her emotional register. Spatial choreography stays clean—rocks, workstation, windows track believably during overnight labor. Weather and moon phase affect visibility and thus tactic timing, charging the final mirror-alignment image. No static tourist catalog; every detail is filtered through her bereaved sailor’s eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create a beacon for returning drowned souls—signaled on first page and tightens each time a call adds coordinates. One meaningful escalation: the recognition that the caller is her future self crystallizes the cost; the option to ever leave the station is foreclosed. Agency is continuous: she scavenges, plots angles, bleeds on glass. Persistent constraint—failed hydraulics—shapes every tactical pivot. Price is visible: shredded palms, lifelong solitude, the final “keep the light burning” oath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief can be transmuted into custodianship, absence into a different species of presence. Subtext resides in objects—bronze foot, mirrors, tide charts—whose meaning refracts anew with each lunar phase. The ending’s conceptual repricing (she is lighthouse keeper to the dead) lands as image, not moral. No platitudes; “raw solace” tone resists tidy comfort, inviting the reader to sit inside an ongoing haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s salt-cracked perception: diction of “patina green-black,” “shattered lenses,” “raw solace” feels hers, not authorial. Rhythmic compression under fatigue—sentence fragments mirror her clipped stamina. No head-hop; unreliability surfaces only when she misrecognizes the caller until the final beat, a payoff seeded by earlier doublings (echoed coordinates, mirrored starlight). Filter verbs appear only when they voice her professionalism (“she could plot exact locations”). Dialogue-free design is apt for solitary watch; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She positioned each mirror according to the coordinates… creating a constellation of reflections” simultaneously shows action, stakes, and cosmic scale. No paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or specificity. Figurative language is spare, sea-sharp: “mechanical joints groaning like something wounded,” “starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams.” Opening and closing lines act as thesis and chorus without repeating phrasing. Copy-clean except one permissible comma splice that propels urgency. Noise-free, high-density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “reverse migration of souls” reverses the cli-fi trope of human retreat inland, making the sea the returning force and grief the compass. Mirror-array beacon for ghosts is fresh yet inevitable given failed hydraulics + lunar lore + coastal setting. Synthesis feels site-specific: only this patchwork navigator with inherited tide tables and shrine fragment could birth this exact light. Risk of solipsistic haunting is embraced, not hedged, producing a singular artistic stance. Derivative-free; no template echo.</comment>
