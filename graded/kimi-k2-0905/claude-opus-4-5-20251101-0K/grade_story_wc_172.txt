<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s warring impulses—world-saving calculus vs. the dodo-egg ache—are embodied in salt crusting her knees; the “mathematics of mercy” line crystallizes the contradiction. Her final kneel-and-release is a micro-choice that costs the last sentimental scrap she denied for decades, earned by the causal chain of drought, guilt, and salt. Flaw works: the same hand that poisoned rivers now lifts bird song into stone. No other character on stage, so relationship bullet waived; headcount clear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal track: drought → exposed lakebed → map of cracks → cavern → burial of song. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the egg and speaker left behind reweight her lifetime of “terrible bargains” into one unpaid gift; cost is the irreversibility of her exit across white nothing—felt in salt skin she never brushes off. Orientation locked by 50 wds; no prop teleport. One tightening: the instant she presses PLAY, the option to keep the egg is foreclosed. Lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Salt flat, body, tool triad constrains every move: crust slices designer cloth, cracks dictate GPS, speaker must be waterproof for future lake. Bruised-plum sky and crystalline fissures mirror her internal fault-lines without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: kneel → place egg → initiate → rise → walk to helicopter; distances preserved. Weather returns as promised rain, dissolving salt she’s wearing—environment literally sticks to her exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she part with the last extant egg to pay an uncollectible debt to extinct life? Pressure escalates through revealed complicity (drought orphans), narrowing to single beat—press button, surrender object. Cost legible: the act empty-palms her of the only private joy her empire couldn’t monetize. No coincidence; agency pure. One meaningful tightening sufficient at this length; closure reweights scale of guilt without redeeming it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: love and destruction are “the same gesture.” No moralizing final sentence; the speaker’s descending song into cavern is the non-literal answer. Subtext in silence—no birds answer back. Fractured grace tone modulates from bruised sky to salt dissolving on skin, charging final image with earned ambiguity. Sentimentality is neither condemned nor celebrated; it is simply paid for with lifelong denial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains Eleanor’s lexicon of infrastructure and geology: “water rights,” “acoustic resonance,” “coordinate in a language only the dying earth spoke.” Rhythm accelerates under thunder, then breathes in bird-call clauses. No head-hop; perceptual signature filters every detail through her priorities—salt is map, egg is balance-sheet item turned relic. Compression taught early (“extinction in her palm”) and paid off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Information dense—“manufactured drought” paragraph packs three years of hydropolitics in 54 words. Mixed metaphor patrol: “sound like God clearing his throat” stays within sky-thunder logic, no clash. Minor scaffold: “she had… she had…” anaphora is purposeful, pattern-taught. Zero loops, zero filter-verb clusters. Final line lands on monosyllabic punch—“Especially then.”—without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-villain who weaponizes drought to save downstream city, then atones by turning sealed cavern into eternal jukebox for ghosts. Dodo egg as both MacGuffin and moral counter-weight feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric stillness on salt flat—heightens rather than dilutes stakes. No derivative premise penalty; combines water-rights thriller with mourning ritual in way not seen before. Specific detail throughout avoids generic eco-catastrophe template.</comment>
