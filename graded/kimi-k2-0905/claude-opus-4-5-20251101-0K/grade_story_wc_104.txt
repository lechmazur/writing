<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—terrorist label vs. farmer’s empathy—are dramatized in the scout standoff; the choice to spare her seeds the demolition cost and is paid for by the chains she still drags away. Interiority stays concrete (“chains… second skin,” “soil would be dry”). Final endurance (iron on wrists) makes cost legible. Slight reserve: scout’s interior is ventriloquised, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: piano-bench cipher → vault accessed → scout spared → seeds saved. Orientation anchored by word 60; demolition clock taught early and tightens to final image. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes freedom now to plant later, chains literalising persistent constraint. Cost visible in last line: “iron around her wrists” as she walks toward dead zones.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rotting carnival prizes, dust beams, and the piano’s “yellowed teeth” are filtered through Mira’s scavenger eye; each detail doubles as emotional mirror and tactical map (keys = staff). Micro-setting of shackles and arrow constrains final choice. Spatial track clean: scout exits same doorway he entered. One slip: “eastern dead zones” named but not yet sensory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save seeds before wall detonation—signalled paragraph 3; two-hour clock narrows to boots-in-doorway crunch. Scout confrontation supplies single meaningful tightening: his arrow set down forecloses alarm and allows escape. Cost transferred from potential explosion to continued imprisonment. No escalation after that beat, but one tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “resilience germinating in impossible conditions” emerges via seed imagery and cracked doll smiles; no explicit thesis. Final image of chained woman carrying life into dead land reweights earlier irony (“liberator in chains”) into paradoxical hope. Ambiguity remains: scout’s mercy may cost him. Avoids sermon; resonance carried by concrete objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mira’s perceptual band—sound of boots, smell of rot, musical cipher decoded by touch. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under threat. No head-hopping; scout’s motive read only through gesture and silence. Occasional elevated diction (“staggering grace”) feels authorial but is brief and motivated by oratorical moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. No synonym loops or filter stacks. Mixed metaphors avoided; “keys… music” metaphor taught and paid off. One scaffold phrase: “she had learned to see patterns where others saw noise” could compress, but does not occlude causality. Clean grammar, precise verbs (“flatten everything,” “pockets heavy”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic seed-heist is familiar, but cipher-as-musical-notation, scout mercy beat, and chained liberator image feel freshly synthesized. Carnival prize graveyard supplies specific haunt absent from standard dystopia. Transformation test passes: swap setting or cipher and plot collapses. Risky grace-tone could slide into sermon yet stays earned by embodied cost.</comment>
