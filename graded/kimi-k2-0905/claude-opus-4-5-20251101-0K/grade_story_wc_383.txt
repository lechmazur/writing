<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mirabel’s arc from passive grief to active gift is legible and embodied in the night-long speech to the shell; the interior contradiction (skeptic/hopeful) is present but summarized more than dramatized in-scene, so the micro-choice pressure feels slightly blunted. The renunciation of being remembered is credible, but the cost is stated (“isolation could become independence”) rather than felt in body or action on the page. Elena remains off-stage; relationship-as-crucible is therefore off-page, so the emotional crucible is solo and thus less sharp.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: steal shell → speak memories → wild resonance broadcast → Elena’s voice returns. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Mirabel relinquishes the need to be remembered, accepting she may never receive reciprocity. The “velvet garden” and shell mechanics are taught early enough; spatial orientation is secure. One minor causality gap: how the stolen half-shell can “receive” Mirabel’s new memories is asserted, not grounded in the established tech rule-set, but the lyric leap is acceptable under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>The garden-as-micro-setting is vivid and selective: purple velvet flowers absorb warmth, wild resonance structures hum; these details constrain action (only here can she broadcast) and charge the final image (the shell glowing among flowers). Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Mirabel’s body—shell pressed to ear, dying light on iridescent surface—without tourist catalog. The Archive towers beyond the hedge serve as off-page anchor only; no occupational detail is required at this length. One small lapse: “tragically radiant” is used twice as label rather than perceptual filter, slightly dulling specificity.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will Elena remember?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: Mirabel decides to give rather than take. Escalation is Accumulative: each spoken memory increases shell-glow and resonance hum, reweighting the cost from theft to gift. The visible price is Mirabel’s acceptance of permanent self-erasure if the broadcast fails; that cost is stated more than embodied, keeping it shy of 8.8+. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening sufficient for lyric frame.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-love vs. state-control emerges implicitly through the shell act, never sermonized. Subtext operates in gesture: setting shell among flowers = planting the gift. Final image (“Elena herself, confused and frightened and suddenly, impossibly, remembering”) reweights prior material without moral tag. One near-moral line—“she had translated her isolation into something stronger”—is abstract but saved by the concrete voice-call that follows. Ambiguity lingers: will the state re-quarantine? Complexity intact.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mirabel’s perceptual signature: velvet petals “absorb the last warmth,” shell surface “catching the dying light with tragic radiance.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for night-long narration, then clipped “Mirabel?” at the end—without drumbeat pattern. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue on page, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “resonance structures” is the only tech phrase, already diegetic. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but information-dense: single sentences advance glow, memory, and stakes simultaneously. No scaffold loops; the two “tragically radiant” repeats are the nearest to synonym churn but spaced enough to avoid artifact. Metaphors (“needles threading heaven to earth”) are coherent and brief. Final line cadence mirrors opening garden breath, earning echo. One tiny simultaneity slip: “she spoke through the night, through the slow rotation of constellations” compresses hours into a phrase, acceptable under lyric ellipsis taught early.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-theft dystopia meets seashell-romance lyricism, made specific through velvet-garden wild resonance. The quarantined-memory premise is familiar but re-angled via the gift-half-shell hack and the garden off-map. Risk in the lyric night-long monologue pays off with the earned voice-call. If swapped to a generic rebel broadcast, the emotional charge would collapse—proof of specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes; the shell-pair mechanic feels novel within genre.</comment>
