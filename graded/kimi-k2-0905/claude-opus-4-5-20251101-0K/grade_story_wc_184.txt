<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s “adaptable warmth” is shown through tactile, patient braid-work that visibly costs her calm; the final smile registers earned change. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers moved…with practiced patience”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the grandmother net memory is told, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal discovery → door appearance → braid repair → bell tone, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the tower’s lost ceremonial function is restored, Mira’s worldview permanently widened, signaled by the “tone it hadn’t produced in two hundred years.” No orientation or telegraph issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clock-tower gears, brass scale, and shifting gold-shadow fibers are filtered through Mira’s cataloguing gaze; the Unity Cord physically constrains her final action. Spatial choreography stays clean as she steps from mechanism to chamber. Micro-setting (rope) directly charges the closing image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore severed connection—tightens when tangled braids threaten permanent failure; her success rings the bell, audible cost campus-wide. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Could use one visceral risk (splinter, dizziness) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges through the cord’s re-knotting and the bell’s returned voice; no character sermonizes. Final line reframes archives as “maps to doors,” a quiet conceptual repricing. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays latched to Mira; perceptual signature is curator-precise (“catalogued every entrance,” “filing system she hadn’t yet decoded”). Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during tactile work—rhythmic control without monotony. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language sparse and purposeful. One scaffold loop: “methodically, the way her grandmother had taught her…” could trim to one clause. Otherwise zero loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Combines archival procedural with folkloric time-cord in a fresh synthesis; “Absent Fables” trope is inverted—absence becomes instruction manual. Risk lies in quiet magical realism that pays off. Not quite a 9 because premise could still transplant to another tower with minor tweaks.</comment>
