<comment>Interiority is textured and specific—her “accidentally prophetic” guilt, the shift from ideological to human-scale service. Micro-choices (handing over the specs, writing the journalist’s fortune) crystallize values with visible cost. Flaw—three-decade stamina never tested on-page; we see no erosion or contradiction under pressure. Still, the final renunciation reads earned because the reflective block lands as a deliberate self-orchestrated break.

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she rewrites herself from hidden spy to public eccentric, price = surrender of secret archive. Causal chain—each fortune batch is a micro-act that accumulates to the final release of the specs—holds under Accumulative lens. Transition from past to present is legible at ~90 words; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening: the journalist’s imminent arrival collapses her options to “reveal or stay ghost.”

<comment>Lighthouse lamp room as micro-setting constrains every move—circular desk, automated beam she’s powerless to stop, archives literally in her hands. Fog and sweeping light return in final image, re-weighted from surveillance to self-guidance. Spatial choreography is tight: specs travel from nose → desk → box, tracking her shift. Tool-level specificity (microdot film, ink, paper slips) anchors Cold-War residue inside domestic ritual.

<comment>Dominant stake: identity—spy vs. seer—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation is Accumulative: each fortune-cookie prophecy widens the gap between public mystery and private knowledge until the journalist forces a public reckoning. Cost is conceptual but legible: surrender of classified specs = permanent loss of covert power. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the accumulated weight of her own unacted past.

<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “open secrets”: fortune cookies, obsolete microdots, lighthouse beam—each visible yet unseen. Final image reweights the motif: the same light that once guided enemy subs now “guides the keeper home,” flipping surveillance into self-revelation. No explicit thesis; meaning resides in the inversion. Emotional after-effect is curiosity tinged with melancholy—truth hidden in plain sight is still loneliness.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is steady, essayistic lyric with controlled cadence; clause length mimics sweep of lighthouse beam. Perceptual signature—“silence and fog,” “minor chord of her abandoned spy career”—is character-bound, not writerly. No dialogue, so register stays consistent. Minor lift in final line’s spondaic beat (“Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home”) gives closure pulse without showiness.

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “She trafficked in human truths” compresses career pivot into one line. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (truth as cookie, beam as guide) stay coherent. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long reflective runs broken by staccato fortune slips. Copy-clean; no grammatical or spatial impossibilities.

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Cold-War relic becomes fortune-cookie oracle; lighthouse retooled from signal tower to privacy shell. Concept of “open secrets” as operational mechanic rather than abstract theme is non-obvious. Risk taken—the entire plot is retrospective—pays off via accumulative reconfiguration. Could edge higher if one fortune had backfired on her personally, but restraint feels deliberate.
