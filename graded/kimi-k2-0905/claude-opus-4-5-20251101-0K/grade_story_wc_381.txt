<comment>Mira’s vocation as a silence-summoner is vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between urgent world-saving and monastic restraint is palpable in her micro-choices (kneeling, trembling retrieval of the wing). Yet her flaw/struggle remains static—no misbelief or capacity limit is tested or overcome—so the climax feels like confirmation rather than costly renunciation. The solitude is atmospheric, but without on-page opposition the relational crucible and status shifts cannot activate. Still, her embodied attention to water, paper, starlight individuates her and satisfies the 9- gate for interior specificity.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard layers silence-density until the final Charged Poise re-weights the prophecy from certainty to possibility. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 10; the 120-word test passes. Closure lands with conceptual cost—millions wake from nightmare into uncertainty—visible in the softened paper wing. However, the cost to Mira herself is only lightly hinted (trembling fingers); a sharper personal price would secure 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The brook, origami wing, and celestial wheel function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics: water carries the wing, paper geometry dictates silence-mapping, starlight times the ritual. Sensory selection skews auditory/tactile, mirroring Mira’s vocation. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. The environment’s quietude is more than postcard; it is the raw material she sculpts, charging the final image when the damp wing docks against stone.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—prevent mass murder of a prophesied child—arrives early and tightens once: the silence-mapping either succeeds or kingdoms burn. Mira’s agency is absolute; no coincidence intrudes. The deepening is the smoothed hush itself, a single intensification that forecloses the hunt. A crisper visible price (blood from paper cut, stamina collapse) would push 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: uncertainty as mercy. Subtext lives in gesture—trembling fingers, softened paper—never thesis. The ending’s birdcall re-prices prophecy from doom to ambient noise without moralizing. One hairline slip: “fragile peace she had cultivated for decades” leans abstract; a concrete image of that peace would perfect the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric achieves a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors content; syntactic parallelism (“She summoned… She called… She placed…”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final quiet. Perceptual signature is acute: Mira hears “water that moved without sound” and sees “silver-lit branches” exactly as a silence-worker would. No head-hop, no register drift. Dialogue absent by design—no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate—spondaic clusters (“stillness…spaces…stars”) mimic hush expanding. Information density high: one line often does three jobs (concrete image + world rule + emotional charge). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor over-alliteration in “softened by water but its form intact” is the only hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The silence-prophecy alchemist is fresh; the origami-wing-as-vector is a lovely specific. Conceptual integrity commits fully—no retreat to action set-piece. Risk resides in lyric stasis, but the closure re-configures meaning rather than decorate mood. Could ascend to 9-band with a sharper personal cost that makes the risk felt on Mira’s body.</comment>
