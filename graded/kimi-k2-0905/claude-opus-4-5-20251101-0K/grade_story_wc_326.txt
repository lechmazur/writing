<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The interiority is concrete—heartbeat counting, porcelain shard against skin—and the final release from counting lands as earned renunciation. Yet the “digital ghost” remains more concept than lived contradiction; we’re told it dissolves but never see it complicate her micro-choices in scene. Emotional specificity is strong; causality between archive and self is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the hinge from proof-of-existence to music-of-existence is character-specific and visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink map and uncounted heartbeats crystallize a before/after with felt cost—she forfeits the numeric shield that kept panic at bay. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns and heartbeat cadence tighten until silence reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. The only soft spot is the off-stage erasure of the ghost—an external dissolve rather than a final action—but the persistent constraint (she must carry failures as lanterns) is legible in the last image.</comment>

<comment>Opal walls trapping light under snow function as a micro-setting that mirrors Mira’s stalled radiance; the ink pool becomes a second, mutable “sky” she physically reads. Sensory hierarchy obeys her gaze—visual, thermal, tactile—without tourist clutter. Weather muffles sound, intensifying the heartbeat metronome. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim scattered selfhood—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation: each ink constellation retrieves a failure, raising the cost of continued dissociation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother’s face surfaces, shifting retrieval from abstract to intimate. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-coherent inside the snow-sealed dome. Cost is visible—she abandons the counting defense—though the ghost’s erasure feels externally granted rather than forced by her final choice.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom inheres in broken fragments, not rectified records. The porcelain shard and ink fissures reweight from relics to lanterns without a moralizing sentence. Final image carries conceptual repricing—failures as lanterns—whose cost is the forfeiture of clean absolution. Ambiguity remains: bureaucratic death is technically uncorrected, yet thematically moot, inviting reflection on what counts as alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is attenuated, mathy, pulse-driven—perfect for a woman who counts herself into being. Syntax is controlled, with clause-length modulation that breathes under pressure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Free-indirect slips are clean: “She needed those failures back” carries the character’s diction without italics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and purposeful; metaphor vehicles (opal, ink constellation, lantern) stay internally consistent. Only minor scaffold: “refracted light in strange ways” is vague filler amid otherwise precise optics. No loops, no register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final release, mirroring the cessation of counting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic-afterlife angle is fresh, yet the “read ink to recall digital ghost” method leans on vaguely mystical tech rather than a rigorously invented rule-set. Emotional specificity—failure as lantern—elevates the piece above trope. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation inside an abandoned observatory at midnight could feel mannered, but here it coheres to character need. Still, the concept’s logic is asserted more than tested, limiting surprise.</comment>
