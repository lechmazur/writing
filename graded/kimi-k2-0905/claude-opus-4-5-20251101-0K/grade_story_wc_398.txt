<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s quiet endurance and the micro-gesture of placing the charred fragment on the table embody contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) under pressure; his choice to stay eleven autumns and now to share the relic forecloses future solitude with visible cost, earning the renunciation. Sofia’s “gently persuasive” stance is dramatized through active listening that extracts testimony rather than exposition. Interiority stays concrete: “second heartbeat” for guilt, “copper light” for memory. No label-speak at peak beats; dialogue carries distinct subtext. The relationship never tilts into power imbalance, yet both leave altered—Earned Stasis achieved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sharing of burned fragments crystallizes a new intersubjective stance under Accumulative/Textural lens—leaf-fall density and amber light reweight stakes rather than causal plot. Orientation clear by line 8; no penalties. Persistent constraint: eleven-year vigil and empty buses visibly shape tactics and final image. Cost is felt in Marcus’s admission “waiting for buses that stopped carrying anyone I recognized.” The ending image of “fragments between them” reconfigures meaning without sentimentality; lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion’s translucent walls act as micro-setting: they tint every gesture sepia, forcing memory into present choice; the burned letter fragment is tactile tool whose charred edge is handled twice, charging the final image. Vineyard rows and vacant station are filtered through Marcus’s caretaking gaze—“vines twisted like arthritic hands”—body metaphor keeps attention anchored. Weather and season tighten scene: October copper light is both clock and mood, narrowing options as winter approaches. Spatial choreography clean: path climb, bench seating, fragment placement all tracked without drift. Environment constrains the choice to share relics—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intersubjective understanding of destined mismatches—signaled early via burned fragment; pressure tightens when Sofia produces the photograph, forcing Marcus to test his private grief against her need. One meaningful deepening: parallel confession that “we both did, in our separate ways” narrows options from solitude to shared witness. Cost is felt time and solitude already spent; no future reset offered. Agency is renunciation of secrecy rather than external action—valid under accumulative lens. No coincidences resolve tension; closure reweights rather than fixes—meets 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from grafted vines and burned letters: mismatched unions still produce drinkable beauty. No explicit thesis; wisdom is earned through sharing fragments rather than stated. Final image of “fragments between them” offers non-literal answer—understanding via shared scars. Subtext in Sofia’s silence and Marcus’s coat-pocket relic carries more weight than dialogue. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers—grandmother’s regret remains private. Meets 9- gate but capped at 8.6 by Q4 not forcing tighter trade-off.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong: Marcus’s sensory hierarchy favors vine anatomy and slant autumn light; Sofia stillness reads as trained listening. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to clipped fragment-sharing beat. Diction stays viticultural-rooted: “rootstock,” “tannins of memory.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Dialogue indirection—“Not to judge her. To understand.”—carries subtext without exposition. Free indirect clean: “He studied her face…” stays within Marcus’s lexicon. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are sustained—lantern pavilion, arthritic vines—without mixed logic. Strong verbs: “copper light caught,” “twisted like arthritic hands.” No filter-verb stacks. Rhythm breathes between descriptive accumulation and terse dialogue. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor; final line resolves with charged image. Minor cadence repetition in “these vines… mismatched unions” but does not obscure closure. Proofing clean: names, tenses consistent. Meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: uses viticultural grafting as lived metaphor for romantic mismatch, transforming familiar lost-love trope. Risk of quiet sharing-scene over confrontation pays off via accrued poetic density. Specific detail—“three legible syllables: never, yours, forgive”—creates memorability. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Conceptual integrity commits to autumnal stillness rather than melodrama. Could swap names yet emotional taxonomy feels particular; transformation sufficient for high band but not groundbreaking enough for 9+.</comment>
