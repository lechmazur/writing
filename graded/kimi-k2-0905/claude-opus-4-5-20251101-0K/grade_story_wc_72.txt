<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Veris's motive—waiting for someone who can bear the knowledge she carries—remains crystal-clear, and her micro-choice to offer the ampoule, knowing it will unravel Mira's grief, is an embodied, costly act. Mira's contradictory impulses (clutch certainty vs. swallow wonder) are dramatized in a single, tactile beat: trembling hands accepting glass that pulses with her brother's peace. The interiority avoids label-speak; grief is tasted as copper and salt. The only limit is that Mira's moral calculus is sketched more than fully lived; we feel the invitation, not yet the price of refusal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the ampoule's light reweights "death" from tragedy to reunion, crystallizing the new rule-set on-page ("death was not an ending but a returning") with undeniable conceptual cost for the living. The causal spine holds: brother extracted → Veris waits → Mira arrives → knowledge transferred → choice foreclosed. Orientation is anchored within 30 words and the single transition is legible. Cost is visible in Veris's stone grinding and Mira's vertigo; no soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but tactical constraint: marble pathways dictate swim-lines, algae limits visibility, the ampoule's foxglove stain is a color cue that later reframes the brother's botanic metaphor. The micro-setting of Veris's cracked chest—"structural weakness where the chisel slipped"—literally enables the extraction beat and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is diver-tight: sound of regulator, taste of salt, green light on gloved fingers. Environment constrains every choice; without watery pressure the glass would shatter, the revelation would disperse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira leave with proof or with transformation?—tightens once: the ampoule's pulse makes the old certainty impossible. Escalation is Accumulative; the garden's three-thousand-year wait accumulates into a single, luminous offer that forecloses the path of vindication. Cost is on-page: Mira's vertigo, Veris's stone abrasion. Agency is reactive—accept or refuse the light—but the refusal option is made imaginatively expensive by the brother's embedded peace. A second reversal would over-crank this length; the one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: consciousness as borrowed light, death as recombination, grief as failure to rejoin. The foxglove stain quietly connotes both poison and medicine—an ambiguity that reweights when the ampoule becomes invitation. Subtext is carried in gesture: the knife hand that never draws, the bubble spiral that never reaches surface. No final moralizing; the last line simply extends the garden's patient stance into universal scale, letting the reader feel the cost of living outside the recombination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient edges toward Veris's telepathic focalization without head-hopping; distance is stable. Syntax elongates to mimic watery slow-motion ("stone grinding against stone after millennia of stillness") then compresses under Mira's adrenaline. Diction stays within a diver's lexicon—regulator, ampoule, phosphorescent—without jargon spill. Perceptual signature is Veris's tactile memory of warmth versus Mira's copper-salt grief. No dialogue to test, but the internal voices remain distinct; Veris's "incisively kind" tone is shown via invitation rather than labeled self-talk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence either advances knowledge or deepens image. Metaphors stay physically coherent ("coral claimed the marble" implies encrustation, not conquest). Varying sentence length mirrors pressure: long aqueous clauses collapse into clipped heart-beat fragments at the hand-off. Opening line anchors both voice and cosmic stakes; final line resolves to Charged Poise without sentimentality. Only micro-slippage: "absolute peace" flirts with abstraction, but is rescued by its embedding in luminous glass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses underwater ruin garden with sentient statue telepathy—an audacious splice that earns inevitability through geological patience. The borrowed-consciousness concept is fresh yet foreshadowed by the sculptor's accidental ritual, avoiding late-rule invention. Risky second-person address to reader ("you don't have to decide now") is calibrated as Veris's direct thought, not meta-wink. Specificity anchors novelty: foxglove stain, coral geometry, silver chain corrosion. Emotional truth—grief converted to invitation—transcends gimmick. The garden's eternity-scale waiting is a bold structural choice that pays off in the final line's cosmic hush.</comment>
