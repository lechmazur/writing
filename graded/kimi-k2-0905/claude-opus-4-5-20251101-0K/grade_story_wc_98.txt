<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara’s interior contradiction—trained skeptic who half-believes the ridge—drives every beat; her tactile micro-choices (testing soil, pressing seed to forehead) keep motivation anchored. The final “luminous doubt” renunciation is earned by the dream descent and costs her seventeen-year vocation. No other character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is waived. Minor softness: “luminous doubt” drifts toward label-speak in the last paragraph, blunting full 9-entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Yara plants the seed without knowing outcome, monsoon arrives, and the ridge’s memory stance is re- configured with felt conceptual cost (“she had spent seventeen years trying to verify into silence”). Accumulative lens holds: each floral/image layer deepens the stake until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 3; no因果 breaks. Dream mechanics are seeded early (“another method…predated reality checking”) and paid off in-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge itself is the constraint: impossible botanic mash-ups and storm runoff literally force Yara to plant before erosion. Micro-setting (seed, soil, palm) and macro-setting (limestone terraces, monsoon sky) alike charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes soil dampness first, starflowers second, because her job is measurement. Environment shapes the stakes and the closing renunciation; without the ridge’s blooming contradiction the conceptual cost vanishes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve last fragment of collective memory”—tightens once: dream access widens knowledge but collapses her taxonomic arsenal, forcing the unmeasureable planting. Monsoon clock is live and materially shortens options. Cost is visible: she blacks her fingers and abandons empirical certainty. Could edge higher if a secondary concrete loss (tool, archive sample) were forfeited on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: measurement vs. memory, truth vs. caretaking. The ridge’s “empirically whimsical” flora enacts the theme without authorial comment. Final image of warm monsoon drops reweights prior motif of “trying to verify into silence,” offering CR. Avoids sermon; one abstract clause (“shape of caring itself”) is forgiven for lyric compression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is稳定, with a perceptual signature attuned to soil, botanical impossibilities, and haptic seed contact. Syntax grows shorter under storm pressure; final paragraph releases into longer, breathy cadence mirroring rain. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register stays within Yara’s trained lexicon; “luminous doubt” is the single near-lapse.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between measured observation and lyric uplift; no template cadence or repetition. Metaphors (“doubt glowed…like phosphorescence”) are singular and paid off. Information density high—each sentence carries botanic specificity or interior tilt. Minor scaffold: “she saw…and further back…” chain could trim one “she saw” without loss; stays under artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy island + reality checker occupation is fresh synthesis; botanic impossibilities serve theme rather than ornament. Dream-interpretation as valid epistemic method subverts standard SF archive trope. Risk stays conceptual, but final renunciation feels inevitable in hindsight. One-half point off for faint echoes of other eco-memory stories, though floral specifics are highly particularized.</comment>
