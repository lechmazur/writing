<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—smell catalogues, hunger for mastery, dread of crowds—but her decisive moment (refusing to stay) is sketched more as thematic coda than as visible cost; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the renunciation beat. Thessaly functions more as oracle than secondary pressure, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation stays consistent yet plateaus; the scent-gift never complicates or endangers her, softening flaw-driven tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: scent-sketches and platform spiral imagery tighten toward the seed transfer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira’s refusal reweights “serenity within motion” with conceptual cost (she leaves the green quiet she coveted). Orientation is clean by word 120. However, the seed itself is causally inert after discovery; no tactic is shaped by it, so cost feels abstract rather than prop-forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canopica’s architecture-as-flower constrains the final insight; that spatial metaphor recurs in doodles and charges the exit image. Olfactory specificity is relentless and biased to Mira’s profession. Selective sensory hierarchy (resin, smoke, rot) mirrors internal shift from revulsion to acceptance. No orientational drift; spatial choreography tracked across rope bridges and platform spirals. Environment subtly guides choice—only after inhaling the bloom’s decay does she decide to descend.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—obtain wisdom, not the bloom—is signaled early and revises to “carry wisdom outward.” One meaningful tightening: the 48-hour decay window forces the vigil beat. Escalation is textural—stench intensifies, sketches evolve from monstrous to geometric—but no external obstacle or trade-off narrows options; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Coincidence absent; resolution rests on internal reweighting, not decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent-metamorphosis: repulsion→recognition→portable wisdom, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext in sketch evolution and seed weight works better than any statement. Final image—“secret she would carry in her sensitive nose”—reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Minor abstraction in “undercurrent of wisdom” phrasing slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bonded to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction skews toward herbalist precision (“resin,” “spathe”) and synesthetic nose-notes. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for stench assault, shorter fragments during ladder descent. No head-hopping; Thessaly’s dialogue remains outward-facing. Filter verbs minimal; sensory verbs dominate. Voice coherence high, with purposeful metaphoric control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence variety strong; openings avoid template cadence. Occasional micro-loop: “breathed in before breathing out” and “serenity within motion” echo twice; not fatal but slightly dilutes freshness. Metaphors mostly coherent, though “frozen dancers” edges toward mixed logic. No scaffold sentences or paraphrase stacks. Copy clean; pronouns unambiguous. Read-aloud rhythm supports contemplative escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Corpse-flower quest is familiar, but framing it as olfactory apprenticeship inside a living floral village yields fresh geometry. Doodle-inside-wrapping custom is particular and irreproducible. Transformation test passes: removing scent-skill or tree-city breaks arc. Risk taken with quiet refusal ending; resonance lands but lacks tangible price, keeping score below top tier.</comment>
