<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory stature-vs-role is vivid, but interiority stays at a regal remove; the “grace that made the air seem clumsy” is the only embodied beat. She never doubts, fears, or weighs cost—her choices are foregone conclusions—so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the genealogy packet placed in the alcove is a Conceptual Repricing that will collapse a dynasty with ink, not war. Causal chain (message → evidence → library drop) holds; the Orientation Test is waived because the library’s folded-time architecture is taught early and pays off in the descent scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Library is tactile: iron-gall pellet cracked open, vellum acid-eaten, shelves that exist “in multiple times simultaneously.” The rune sinking through stone is the charged micro-setting that constrains the next move and re-appears in the final image of quiet dissolution—meets the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent false coronation—is signaled by line 4. Single tightening: discovery of misfiled genealogy forecloses Mira’s neutrality; once evidence is assembled, inaction becomes impossible. Cost is conceptual (erosion of legitimacy) rather than visceral, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “graceful collapse” emerges through image pattern: rune of drift, ink eating vellum, kingdom undone by paperwork. No moralizing; final line reweights “titan” as one who bears truth’s weight, not mountains. Subtext in marginalia keeps danger oblique and democratic—truth can hide in footnotes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to Mira’s ancient, courtly idiom—“regally unpretentious,” “stars learned their current positions”—without leakage. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for eons, then crisp verbals (“She climbed… She placed”) when mortal time resumes. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and information. No loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“mourning veil draped over forgotten centuries”) stay coherent because the veil is the shadow, not an add-on. Peak beat—the rune sinking—uses monosyllabic verbs to accelerate, then closes on the hush of “drifting down.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: titan as archivist, legitimacy dissolved by ink chemistry, cosmic clockwork synced to library hours. The “paperwork coup” flips epic fantasy tropes without spoof. Risk—no battle, only marginalia—pays off in a final image that feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
