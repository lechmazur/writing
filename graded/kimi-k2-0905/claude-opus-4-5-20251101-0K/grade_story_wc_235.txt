<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—desire to map dreams vs. ache of being mapped by them—stays embodied: fingers on bark, ribs twisting under jealousy. Micro-choices (rolling another scroll, deciding to climb) foreclose escape routes with visible fatigue. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped; single-POV voice coherent and particular. Final “smile tasting wonder beneath jade exhaustion” crystallizes endurance at cost, satisfying 9+ quick test for earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: scroll entries, grave, flight memory layer into a pattern break—she stops fearing the end and writes toward it. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the chaos was the narrative” reweights premise without tidy fix; cost is the perpetual temporal vertigo she accepts. Orientation clean by 120 words; no causal reversals needed under this lens. Minor slip: “three weeks / eleven years / decades” timeline could feel outline-like, but density of sensory anchors keeps beat-level propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Birch bark, cabin window, meadow grave—each recurs and constrains: bark demands handwriting, grave demands acknowledgment, window frames the climb she’ll attempt. Mountain wind’s scent of “birch and snow” recharges opening bark image at closure. Spatial choreography tight: table → window → meadow below tracked cleanly. Micro-setting (her own handwriting on bark) functions as environment that limits action. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she live forward while knowing her ending? Pressure tightens when jealousy of her past dreaming-self forces the choice to climb anyway. No external antagonist; escalation is accretive—each scroll layers cost until stance crystallizes. Visible price: surrender of linear certainty, accepted on page. Agency satisfies lens: her decision to write toward death narrows future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image set: chronicling vs. living, flight vs. grave. “Feral nostalgia” is named once but dramatized through bodily ache and scroll ritual; no final moralizing. Final gust of birch-snow scent offers non-literal answer: embrace out-of-sequence story. Complexity preserved—no tidy resolution between knowledge and peace. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—“jade of her exhaustion,” “feral nostalgia” belong to Vera’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for memory, clipped fragments under jealousy. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Metaphors integrated to POV: scroll as net, chaos as narrative. Meets 9+ quick test for distinct signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>No loops, scaffolds, or synonym churn. Information-dense lines: “chronicling lucid dreams for eleven years… cartographer mapping shifting continents” packs backstory and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language restrained; when used (“valley floor a quilt”), it’s precise and brief. Opening and closing lines echo birch/snow without repetition fatigue. Minor cadence echo—“She’d… She’d…” x2—acceptable as pattern reinforcement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Temporal haunting via dream archive feels fresh; “feral nostalgia” reframes standard time-travel ache. Grave-in-meadow twist lands early and seeds closure. Jealousy of own prior clarity is specific inflection not seen in typical chrononaut tales. Concept committed: no safety exit via “it was all a dream.” Risk (lyric non-linear structure) heightens coherence. Transformation test: swap names and you lose bark-scroll inscription logic.</comment>
