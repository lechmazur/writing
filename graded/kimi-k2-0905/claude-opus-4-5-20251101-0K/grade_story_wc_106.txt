<comment>Mira’s contradictory twin drives—thief’s nerve vs. mother-haunted idealist—collide in the pickpocket beat, her pulse against cold glass embodying both hunger and ethical correction. The micro-choice to palm the jar while handing over decoy paper crystallizes her hierarchy: freedom of light > personal safety > legality. Closure cost is felt: station clock chimes doom behind her, mother’s “presence” purchased with permanent exile from normal life. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; flaw (compulsion to steal beauty) drives the mistake of lingering to feel the glow, tightening stakes.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: flower-code intel → body-block ruse → jar swap → flight; each beat narrows escape routes as sunset clock runs. Closure is a Decisive Change: collector’s loss is irreversible, Mira’s destiny door opens onto perpetual night-theft. Cost is on-page: “the first cry of dismay” behind her + moonbeam warmth against chest = wanted fugitive future. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark (platform, dusk, target bag); no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Emerald tiles double as mirror + pressure gauge: jade-to-silver shift signals moonrise and triggers visible jar glow, coercing the swap beat. Spatial choreography is clean: vendor row, bench, exit turnstile track without impossible drift. Selective sensory triage—scent of jasmine, cool glass, chime—serves urgency over panorama. Micro-setting (moonbeam jar) literally constrains next move: visible radiance forces accelerated departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate moonbeams before full dark—tightens once: sunset deadline → moonlit exposure, foreclosing wait-and-watch option. Single reversal: collector’s complacency flips to loss at touch-point. Price paid on-page: Mira trades anonymity for radiant evidence warming her coat—future pursuit now inevitable. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word span; causal lens holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—art must circulate, not be hoarded—emerges through Mira’s backstory fragments and the culminating act of pouring stolen light onto sleeping orphans. Subtext in flower code and sunset clock avoids explicit sermon. Final image of station fading while moonbeams stay with her offers resonant reconfiguration of “ownership.” No tidy moral; ambiguity survives in her outlaw status.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical free-indirect prose mirrors Mira’s painterly eye: “sunset surrendered,” “luminous disbelief,” syntax elongates then compresses during theft. Perceptual signature stable—every noticed detail filtered through light-thief aesthetic. No head-hop; single POV remains intact. Rhythmic control varies sentence length to breathe under sunset awe then tighten during swap—no mechanical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: “jade-tiled walls catching last amber rays” does world, time, and mood in one stroke. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent to light motif. Minor scaffold: “practiced invisibility” + “quiet purpose” echo familiar thief phrasing but do not stall beat. Closure line “the moonbeams glowed brighter…” is crisp, undecorated—image carries weight without prose bloat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “gentle thief redeems stolen wonder” arc is refreshed by specific craft: flower-code spy system, moonbeam physics tied to lunar angle, and orphanage endpoint that fuses personal + cosmic stakes. Transformation test fails if collector or jar renamed—moonlight pour demands liquid-light logic. Risk of lyrical mode is accepted and paid off with clear closure. Not radically novel, but synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
