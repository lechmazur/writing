<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s calm, grave-tending pragmatism is vividly embodied (“gardener’s hands finding each rung”) and consistently motivates her patience with the tapestry; the final quiet smile and decision to dig tomorrow crystallize a credible, low-key change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only minor flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never hesitates or risks failure—so the arc is more steady revelation than tested character. Still, the inherited vocation and star-lit acceptance feel specific and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the coordinates rewire the past fifteen years of gardening into an active next move, a conceptual repricing with felt legacy-cost. Causal chain holds—letter → tapestry → decoding → cemetery—each step contiguous; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (cobalt silo ladder) and the single transition (climb → platform) is legible. The story’s slight lack of pressure or risk keeps it shy of 9.0, but the reconfiguration is undeniably on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting: its cold rungs, starlight, and echoing hollow directly shape Mira’s meditative pace and supply the literal elevation for cosmic perspective that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (velveteen gloom, brass lid click) and filtered through a gardener’s tactile bias. Weather is absent but irrelevant; spatial choreography is clean. The silo’s color and height are reused, not mere postcard flourishes, and they constrain her literal and figurative stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the grandmother’s hidden intention—signals early and tightens once: the border threads resolve into precise coordinates, turning abstract curiosity into concrete next action. The escalation is purely knowledge-based (Accumulative lens) rather than risk-based; no external obstacle or time pressure complicates the decoding, so cost is conceptual, not visceral. Still, the single deepening effectively reweights her past fifteen years of gardening, satisfying the “one meaningful tightening” bar for this length. Agency is intact: her fingers do the untangling that produces the revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: meaning travels in threads—light, cloth, blood—and the dead speak if you learn their quiet language. No character sermonizes; the final image of starlight as untangle-able tapestry offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful: the exact nature of “uncharted echoes” stays suggestive, inviting reflection without confusion. The insight feels earned because it grows from Mira’s concrete labor under stars, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptual filter: starlight on midnight-blue paint, thread tension on fingertips, gardener’s patience. Syntax is rhythmic and varied, with controlled longer sentences that mimic slow untangling; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a gardener’s lexicon (“root systems,” “delicate bulbs”) and avoids decorative thesaurus-itis. Voice never leaks into grandmother’s or stars’ perspective; focalization is immaculate.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “velveteen gloom,” “cathedral of stars,” “visual music” carry triple duty—image, tone, and thematic resonance—without crowding any single beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry = music = starlight) and do not contradict physical logic. Very minor lyric padding in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.0, but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The inheritance-via-tapestry device is fresh, yet the decoding-as-coordinates twist is a known trope; the star-lit silo vantage and gardener’s patience give it new inflection. Specificity of cemetery reading (plastic flowers vs. handwritten letters) transforms a familiar “listening to the dead” concept into lived craft. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though the risk level is modest. Boldness lies in quietness rather than structural daring.</comment>
