<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—“boundary-lessly trapped within her gift” dramatizes the fractal invasion of self. The weaving of external griefs into her own psyche is a visceral, embodied micro-choice each time she orients the loom. Her final reclamation of name is earned because each collected burden visibly anchors the pattern and lessens her diffusion. The only gap is a slight diagnostic tint—“fractals… calcify her mind”—but it is quickly followed by sensory consequence, so the flaw stays minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the exchange of accumulated burdens for a self-boundary is legible and charged. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of echoed griefs increases until the cadence shifts at dawn. Causality holds: because she absorbs each sorrow-thread, therefore the fractal gains weight and she gains edges. The single-scene orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt is triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bronze walls that “sing when touched” and “shingled hush” are sensory, selective, and filtered through Elara’s auditory obsession. The grotto’s acoustic properties directly enable her collection method—orientation toward each grief-pool—so setting constrains tactic. Starlight aperture and mineral sweat recur to mark time and internal shift. The loom and lamp burner act as micro-settings that charge the final image when she presses the weaving to the wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of self from pattern diffusion—is signaled in para 2. Pressure tightens once: the asymmetrical, heavy fractal emerges, proving external grief can anchor her mind. The cost is visible—each burden she takes leaves her more solid, the final one reclaiming her name. Under Accumulative lens, the density shift at dawn reweights the stake successfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox that self is recovered only by absorbing others’ pain. Subtext lives in the hush: silence is not empty but layered with confessed sorrow. The lamp burner’s unlit warmth and the “edges she could finally feel” reweight the earlier boundary-less state without moralizing. No echo of thesis language occurs; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is Elara’s auditory bias—“shingled hush,” “mineral sweat,” threads that “hum.” Syntax grows shorter under peak pressure—“She whispered it once, testing the shape of it in her mouth”—mirroring crystallization. No dialogue to distort voice. Diction stays within mythic register without drifting into academic or therapy idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences layer grief and geology in single strokes—“copper ore had oxidized into walls of living metal.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at the final dawn lift without losing clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and return recharged image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fractal-weaving as self-dissolution is fresh; sacred absolution-via-echoing-cave is inverted into deliberate theft of sorrow. The kerosene lamp that remembers fire without being lit is a small, non-obvious reprise. Concept commits fully—no soft reset that restores her intact; instead boundaries acquire finite, aching edges. Risk is lyrical rather than plot-clever, coherence intact.</comment>
