<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her lilac unease, chalk-stained fingers, and sensory read of the mandala keep her particular. Contradictory impulses surface when she both defies the old man and invites him to witness. The final renunciation—art will fade but listening persists—carries conceptual cost, yet the old man’s arc is thinner; his fear dissolves too readily for a stranger under world-ending pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: mandala, tile, grotto whispers layer density until the silence itself re-weights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mira’s “silence as invitation” reframes the unlearning with felt cost. Orientation is swift: mist, flaking tile, grotto acoustic rules taught by line 6. One causal micro-turn: the tile’s warmth reorients whispers toward her pattern, tightening options without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, tile, and colored sand are lived-in tools, not postcards. The tile flake’s changing temperature and acoustic pull constrain micro-choices—placement at mandala’s center redirects whisper vectors. Scale stays intimate; micro-setting doubles as tool and sacred space, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, reflecting both POV artist and premise of vanishing sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover meaning before universal silence—signals early. Tightening occurs when tile’s hum forces a stance: abandon art or embrace listening; this narrows options under accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: acceptance that creations will scatter yet must still be made. Old man’s initial resistance supplies pressure; his quick conversion lessens the final trade-off’s bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern and image: manufactured noise vs. generative silence. Subtext in the old man’s softened knees and shared kneeling conveys conversion without sermon. Final image—ephemeral chalk figures dancing toward scattering—answers the thematic question non-literally. Ambiguity remains: is the remembering that follows the hush human or cosmic? Complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person tight keeps close psychic distance to Mira; perceptual signature is color-acoustic: “colors that no longer existed,” “spirals nesting within spirals.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for mandala building, staccato for whisper interjections. No head-hopping; old man’s shift is shown externally through gesture. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon; “lilac-soft” used once, not overwritten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—e.g., “tile flake…felt its weight, its wrongness.” No synonym loops or template cadence; varied sentence openings. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay acoustic/artistic. Momentum breathes—compresses transit between mandala layers without stall. Final line earns rhythmic payoff by echoing earlier “silence as invitation” with added charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silence-as-apocalypse is familiar, but coupling it with acoustic grotto + chalk mandala + tile shard offers fresh sensory synthesis. Risky accumulative structure pays off: no villain, no physical jeopardy—pressure is ontological. Conceptual integrity maintained; world forgets itself, so story avoids easy noise = evil cliché. Could tip into familiar eco-parable terrain, but specificity of artist tools and grotto acoustics keeps it particular.</comment>
