<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—terrified mother vs. inter-dimensional locksmith—are dramatized in her tactile grip on the pouch and the star-guided re-write of cosmic machinery; the renunciation of “simply free the idea” is earned, costs the sky itself, and lands with embodied shivers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s silvering and Elena’s first word reweight the premise with undeniable social/emotional cost; causal chain (lock of hair ➔ star hint ➔ stone pattern ➔ mother’s rewrite) holds without gaps; persistent price—Mira now carries the terrible secret home—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The velvet pouch, the shifting standing-stone symbols, and the star-beam act as micro-setting that physically constrain Mira’s finger placement and unlock sequence; spatial choreography inside the circle stays coherent through tactile verbs (“pressed,” “withdrew,” “tucked”); the ribbon’s color-shift in final image recharges atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—Elena’s voice—tightens when the star-beam forces Mira to decide between freeing the raw terror or transforming it; the choice forecloses her own ignorance of cosmic fragility and carries visible price (three-colored dawn, silvered ribbon); agency is internal but decisive under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love as a lock-pick emerges organically from events rather than assertion; the final “Mother” is quiet yet reconfigures meaning without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—cosmic terror still exists, only now mother and daughter share it—earning complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; rhythmic escalation mirrors star-wheel turning, with short percussive sentences at climax (“She rewrote the mechanism”); diction (“starlight like honey from a broken comb”) is precise, POV-plausible, and returns in transformed ribbon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without template cadence; information density high—each sentence advances image or emotion; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; minor scaffold in “shadowed nexus under starlight” repeated descriptor but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Locksmith-who-picks-ideas is fresh synthesis of parental grief and cosmic horror; the starlight-as-tumbler concept feels inevitable in hindsight; risk (cosmic rewrite) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity of ribbon’s color-shift and three-hued dawn lifts trope into memorable image.</comment>
