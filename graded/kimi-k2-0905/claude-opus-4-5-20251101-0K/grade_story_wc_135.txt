<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s vocation and exile motive are crisp, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the single on-page choice—returning to the desk—carries no visible trade-off or risk, so the “earned” stasis feels lightly purchased. The emotional cost is asserted (“she could not change what had been lost”) rather than embodied in a moment of friction. Micro-choices under pressure are missing; all key beats happen in summary while she handles objects.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final lamplight image reweights the premise—absence becomes navigable—at visible cost (lifelong vigil). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each salvaged fragment tightens the pattern. Orientation is clean by 120 words. The −0.2 non-closure cap reflects one minor scaffold: “Day after day” telescopes the decisive intensification instead of letting a single archival session crystallize the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Salt-stung paper, verdigris on brass, and rain-scrubbed limestone are selective and POV-filtered. The trumpet valve serves as micro-setting that constrains choice: its repair record forces Elena to cross-reference and thus publicly resurrect the lighthouse crime. The harbor’s post-rain luminescence bookends the piece, charging the final lamplight image. One minor slip: “glistening with the particular luminescence that gave the harbor its name” is a touch expository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep exhuming painful absences—surfaces early. Pressure escalates texturally: each new fragment tightens the communal grief and Elen’s moral obligation. The meaningful turn is the widow’s sob—proof that excavation works—yet it occurs off-stage; we hear the result, not the confrontation, so the cost is vicarious. Closure linkage is strong (she commits to perpetual vigil), but the beat that forces the commitment is narrated, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: absence is not emptiness but a mapable coastline. Subtext resides in silent objects—the valve’s solder scar speaks of complicity louder than any accusation. The ending’s lamplight reconfigures the rule-set without moralizing. One soft echo: “navigated absences” is repeated near the midpoint, a hair too explicit for a story otherwise confident in implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays latched to Elena; perceptual signature is salted, patient, catalogic—“cataloguing the fragments of ships and sailors who never returned home” tells us how she thinks. Syntax lengthens and breathes during archival acts, then tightens into metonymic compression (“the valve told her things”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One micro-drift: “she had learned long ago” momentarily abstracts rather than embodies the insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences carry double duty (image + back-fill). No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“verdigris,” “luminescence”) is justified by archivist POV. One scaffold sentence: “She began her work methodically…” merely labels the next paragraph; cutting it would sharpen propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The ocean-spray archivist is a fresh occupational lens on the wreck-trove trope; the reactive-vision gift turns typical sleuthing into a lyric, almost synesthetic act. Using “navigated absences” as both method and moral stakes gives the piece conceptual lift. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, accumulative structure—but the execution commits fully. The lighthouse-bribery backstory is familiar, yet the archival aftermath angle reconfigures it.</comment>
