<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nameless woman’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes-scaled: her fingers “trailing rust and salt,” the glass-pressed label as tactile relic, the decision to “breathe with the tide.” Contradictory impulses (grief vs. vengeance, erasure vs. witness) co-exist in-scene rather than in summary. The only micro-slip is a touch of diagnostic self-tag (“she had learned to filter reality differently”) that momentarily abstracts what the body is already dramatizing; it keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rising tide covers the erased maze while she waits “with the patience of the presumed dead,” a charged poise that reweights every prior erasure into unkillable testimony. Causality is clean—overheard fragment → poison label recognition → tomorrow’s confrontation—each because/therefore tightening the noose. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits re-entry into sanctioned life; the certificate’s nullification is irreversible. Lens (Causal) is taught early and held to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The port-container labyrinth is not backdrop but agon: rusted walls “eight stories high” compress movement, ladders dictate escape routes, moon-pull governs visibility and audibility. The tide-as-clock forces every tactical climb or descent; the sodium-orange glow above versus the mud-choked silence below mirrors her liminal citizenship. Micro-setting objects—glass-square label, rust on fingertips—constrain choice and physically carry memory. One decimal off 9 only because a single spatial coordinate (“lower passages”) is briefly vague in the overhear beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the Meridian existed, avenge erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the dockers’ gossip pins her husband’s loss to the same poison notation. Agency is accumulative: each fragment she layers narrows the doctor’s future options and raises her own exposure. The visible price is the forfeiture of reclamation into life; she embraces perpetual ghosthood. A hair more tightening would require an on-page failure beat, but the cadence shift at tide-turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: bureaucratic murder by paperwork versus oral memory that salt air cannot redact. The poison label, tide rhythm, and container serial numbers form a recurring triad of official vs. lived time. Final image reconfigures the premise—erasure becomes weaponized visibility. No moral is declared; the reader is left to weigh the social cost of a world where death certificates can be typeset like shipping invoices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pressed to her skin: “she felt it in her bones,” perceptual signature of rust-salt-metal. Diction is corrosive, tidal, maritime—“sodium-orange,” “corrugated canyons,” “bureaucratic acid”—never elevated beyond her lived lexicon. One near-slip: “she preserved it between two squares of glass” momentarily sounds curatorial, but the next clause anchors the act to evidence, not art. Rhythm swells and recedes with sentence length, echoing the tide without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence compounds image + knowledge: “containers… creating canyons of forgotten cargo and shadow” does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles—and compress under pressure rather than bloom. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new rule set. Density is so high that removing any paragraph would collapse either spatial clarity or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The erased-wife-as-port-ghost trope is refreshed by making the container maze itself the archive: steel walls as palimpsest, tide as file clerk. Risk is taken in withholding proper names, yet specificity of sensory idiom keeps it from generic anonymity. Synthesis feels inevitable—bureaucratic shipping logic + maritime grief = mnemonic flaneur. No echo of famous lines; the closest cultural touchstone (Vertigo’s Madeleine) is inverted—she is alive-to-self, dead-to-state.</comment>
