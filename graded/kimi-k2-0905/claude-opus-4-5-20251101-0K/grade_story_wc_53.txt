<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to survival while still yearning to create—are embodied in her tactile handling of the camera wheel and her willingness to speak the unsayable (“I pretended the stopping was a choice”). The ghost functions as an external pressure, forcing a micro-choice that reconfigures her stance, so the arc is earned. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of self-erasement and accepts the ache of continuity. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s spoken admission dissolves the ghost and reweights her future options while the frozen carousel persists as visible cost. Causal linkage holds: because she finally voices the fear-driven erosion, the ghost can relinquish its claim. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends under a causal lens. One minor loop: “perpetual motion” is repeated twice in close succession, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop; its current literally delivers the camera wheel and later swallows the ghost, constraining Mira’s tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (she notices phosphorescent spray, cold, serrated edge) and mirrors her slippery memory. Spatial choreography is clean: crouch → stand → pocket → watch. The camera wheel fulfills the micro-setting role, charging the final image as she pockets it and decides to keep moving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Mira will keep erasing her former self or re-own her creative drive—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the ghost demands acknowledgement, foreclosing the option of continued pretense. Cost is legible in the final image; the carousel remains still, proving the external world unchanged yet her internal options reconfigured. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific image of a broken camera wheel still able to turn: creativity can outlast its mechanism if acknowledged. Subtext resides in the ghost’s translucent legs and the cold spray that only wets Mira—metaphors for unshared regret. No moralizing; the final line is imagistic action. The reprise of “moving” reweights the earlier stasis without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: temporal confusion, mechanical metaphors, and a hushed, tidal rhythm. Compression (“three days ago, or perhaps three years”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; the ghost’s dialogue is filtered through Mira’s awareness. Syntax modulates with pressure—short admissions under spray, longer reflections on the wheel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; only one paraphrase loop (“perpetual motion”) and one stock phrase (“tumbled from the sky”) appear, neither in the final third. Strong verbs (churn, erode, dissolve) propel sentences. No mixed metaphors. Grammar clean; pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic sky-carousel is fresh, yet the core insight—artistic identity can survive mechanical collapse—feels universal rather than gimmicky. The ghost-as-younger-self trope is transformed by the lagoon’s rule that only Mira gets wet, making the encounter materially asymmetrical. Risk in blurred chronology is purposeful and coherent. Specific detail (serrated edge worn smooth) prevents generic anywhere/anytime drift.</comment>
