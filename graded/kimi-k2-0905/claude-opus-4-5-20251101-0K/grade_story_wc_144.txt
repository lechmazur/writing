<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her haptic, thermal, and sonic world feels lived-in, and her micro-choices (testing rotors by ear, bonding the lens) manifest a hierarchy of values. Blindness is never a gimmick; it constrains and enables real tactics. The “magnetic calm” is credible as practiced poise under deadline, not superpower. Flaw: no contradictory impulse visible in-scene; she never doubts or misreads, so the arc is flat—steady competence rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single causal chain: seized drone → merchant’s noon deadline → Elara’s tactile diagnosis → patch → flight test → anchor lifts. Closure is Earned Stasis: she returns to shop, calm intact, with the felt cost of time spent and mist still pressing. Orientation locked by line 10. No reversals, but one meaningful tightening: harbor bells move closer. Stake stays local—one ship’s voyage—yet reweights her night-long labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass basin of water becomes micro-setting that literally refracts stakes; its cool spot reveals the fracture that would ground the ship. Mist and depot furnish sonic/tactile geography without visual cliché. Spatial choreography is flawless—tools by texture, customer’s footsteps tracked. Environment constrains: mist thickens = time gauge; rail lines = arteries she cannot travel. Final image of mist on skin recharges opening god-breath metaphor with earned calm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><grade>Dominant stake—merchant’s maiden voyage—signaled early and kept visceral by noon bell. Escalation is linear: each diagnostic beat strips another option until patch is only path. Price is time and fingertip stamina; no larger loss, so scale stays modest. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under causal lens. Sufficient but not unforgettable tightening.</grade>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-attention emerges from iterated repair gestures, never sermonized. Final image—mist as second sight—reweights blindness from deficit to alternate clarity. Subtext in merchant’s hurried footsteps versus Elara’s stillness dramatizes pace-of-life critique. Avoids tidy moral; leaves reader sensing that “decoding feedback” is lifelong vocation, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s sensorium; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with her rhythms—long sentences for exploratory touch, fragments when rotors click true. Diction stays within plausible blind mechanic lexicon; no decorative latinate drift. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: warmth-pattern, micro-hum, brass basin echo. Dialogue minimal but natural; merchant’s “anchor lifts at noon” carries subtext of desperation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic repetition. Sentences multitask: “She felt it in the uneven distribution of heat” simultaneously advances plot and reveals method. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (mist as breath, rails as veins). One paraphrase loop: “She had learned… she had learned…” → −0.2. Otherwise crisp, high-density prose that propels rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind rail-depot mechanic who literally sees by water-refraction turns familiar disability trope into tactile epistemology. Drone-as-hummingbird is not re-skinned fairy; its micro-rotor song becomes diagnostic tool. Risk is quiet—no world-saving stakes—yet specificity of mist, depot, and basin keeps it from generic “maker” template. Could swap setting to dockyard with little loss, so freshness is moderate.</comment>
