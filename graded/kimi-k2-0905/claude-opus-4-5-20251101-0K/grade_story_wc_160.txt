<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the trembling hands, chain-clink, and tear-streaked face embody contradiction between inherited guilt and new knowledge. The final renunciation—silence chosen again, now knowingly—pays the cost of her grandmother’s disgrace forward, earned by the decoded letter and her own calibrated resolve. No stock labels; every emotional beat is filtered through machinist perception of living stone and sleeping giants. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory hindsight in “she understood now,” but it is immediately grounded in tactile memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira reseals the truth, accepting the same silence Elara endured, but now as a conscious tactic awaiting alliance. The cost is legible—she walks back into daylight carrying the chain and the burden of postponed justice. Causal lens holds throughout: because Elara hid, Mira decodes, therefore she chooses strategic silence. No orientation drift; amphitheater breathing teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final exhale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The volcano-amphitheater is not backdrop; its pulsing heat dictates tempo, narrows perception, and provides the sulfurous light needed for decoding. The surveyor’s chain doubles as micro-setting, constraining every cipher move. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Mira’s engineer gaze—temperature as calibration, obsidian cracks as pressure gauges. One minor over-portrait of “morning mist” on exit, but the final image re-centers the chain against her chest, recharging the locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the villages—surfaces in the decoded letter and immediately reframes Elara’s disgrace as Mira’s inheritance. Escalation is knowledge-based: each cipher line narrows Mira’s options until silence-with-purpose becomes the only safe stance. The price is explicit: she must preserve the lie to prevent fresh genocide. Under causal lens, the tightening is clean—discovery forces restraint, not liberation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as encrypted compassion: love that accepts public hatred to shield the powerless. No authorial thesis—meaning is built from brass links, volcanic breath, and the reagent’s violet shift. Final image of the chain “warm now against her chest” reweights the premise: silence can be a living, measurable instrument of care. Ambiguity remains—will alliances suffice?—but the emotional aftereffect is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Mira’s machinist lexicon: stone breathes, machines sleep, adhesive ages in amber-to-violet spectra. Rhythm accelerates during decoding, then lengthens into resolved calm as she climbs out. No filter-verb stacks; every verb is chosen for tactile precision. The single POV never leaks; even Elara’s voice arrives only as ciphered artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances both atmosphere and engineering logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each new detail adds pressure or tool knowledge. Metaphors are consistent: volcanic respiration = moral respiration. One tiny scaffold—“she understood now”—but immediately paid by embodied memory. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless, mirroring the amphitheater’s inhale/exhale cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dam-sabotage myth reframed as forced martyrdom feels fresh, especially filtered through a floodgate engineer’s inherited metrics. Brass chain as cipher key and moral compass is a specific, non-transferable object. Risk is taken by making the climax a refusal rather than exposure, yet coherence holds. Slight deduction for echoing real-world corporate-indigenous dynamics, but the volcanic amphitheater encryption gives it singular contour.</comment>
