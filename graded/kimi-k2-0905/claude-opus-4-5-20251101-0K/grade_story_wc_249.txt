<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her “small defiances” and the ache of housing another mind are rendered through embodied beats (climbing, drumming, tears). The final relinquishment of Elias is earned: her choice to keep returning to the garden after curfew makes her stance legible. The quiet cost—loneliness redefined as cleared space—lands as credible renunciation. No diagnostic self-labeling; emotions stay sensory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each percussive layer adds density until the garden itself “breathes” the fused dream. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias diffuses into the sound lattice, Mira accepts eternal surveillance as price. Cost is visible: “the loneliness felt different now… space left after completing something.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; pattern taught early (quantum-fiber haunt) pays off in final shimmer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Crystalline paths, acoustic spires, and bioluminescent lagoon are filtered through Mira’s musician-ear bias; every surface she strikes becomes a tactile instrument. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral ascent, perch, descent track without drift. The garden’s stored sounds constrain tactics: only by drumming can she unlock the lattice, so setting actively shapes climax. Final image of starlight bending through water recharges earlier Elias sketch, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate/transmute Elias’s trapped consciousness—signaled in paragraph 3. Middle tightening occurs when garden responds to drumming: option narrows to “keep playing or abandon him forever.” Price is her solitude and future compliance with lab tests. Agency is continuous (night violation, climb, percussive ritual); no coincidence; escalation is density-driven, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as survivable matter—emerges through fused memory, percussive encoding, and final auric shimmer rather than assertion. Subtext of post-mortem collaboration is carried in silence: no dialogue, only shared rhythm. Final image reweights premise: immortality is porous, distributed, lonely. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity (is Elias truly gone?) lingers legitimately.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly pinned to Mira’s sensory cascade; no head-hop. Percussive syntax (“drumming on everything within reach”) mirrors musical cognition. Lexicon stays within credible scientist-patient range—quantum fibers, molecular lattice—without jargon dump. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as physical resonance (“she heard Elias in its shimmer”). Voice modulation under stress: clauses shorten as beat intensifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data (“golden glow intensified, waves forming patterns that matched her rhythm”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts tight; each advances knowledge or charge. Minor scaffold: “she had been” opener appears twice; doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum entanglement meets sound-sculpture memorial in under 800 words. Concept of memory-to-matter composition feels inevitable yet new. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—pays off in resonant closure without gimmickry. Specificity of extinct whalesong fused with nursery rhyme prevents generic SF backdrop. Transforms familiar grief-into-art trope via tactile percussion ritual.</comment>
