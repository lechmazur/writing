<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s warm curiosity is credibly etched through her seven-year habit of asking after widows’ recipes and gardeners’ devotions; the diary discovery turns this trait into a causal engine. Interiority stays concrete—amber lenses warming her chest, palms pricking with cold—rather than diagnostic. The final gesture of lifting the first jar is earned: her prior servant labor and decoded grief literally build the muscle and moral authority to release Vesper’s light. Cost is visible: the diary’s cracked leather and her mother’s death freight the moment so the renunciation of servitude carries tangible loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: diary → goggles → decrypted instruction → jar release; each step depends on the previous. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by elevator shaft and floor counter within 120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the instant light scatters across Vesper’s face, grief is re-valued as something that must circulate, not be embalmed. Cost is legible: Mira forfeits her anonymous safety and Vesper forfeits her frozen stasis; both pay in exposed vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brass-geared elevator groaning against ice walls is sketched with economy yet keeps returning to guide spatial rhythm. Frosted window, thinning clouds, and prismatic walls act as micro-setting that literally refracts the plot’s decryption method. The observatory’s crystalline jars (handled, lifted, poured) meet the micro-setting test by constraining the final choice: only here can light be released into sky. Sensory triangulation—cold bite, amber glow, glass clink—is selective, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freezing grief vs. circulating joy—is signaled in diary line #1. Escalation is textural: each decoded page thickens the moral density until the single option is release. Agency is Mira’s hand lifting the jar; the irreversible spill of light forecloses her servant anonymity and Vesper’s preserved stasis. Cost is visible on-page: Vesper’s tears become the first meltwater, a lived price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Joy-as-light emerges through handling, not lecture: amber lenses, crystalline jars, scattered refractions. Subtext resides in silence—Vesper’s gasp is the only dialogue needed. The ending image answers the thematic question—should grief be preserved or released—without moralizing. Wisdom is earned: mother’s aphorism is validated only after Mira risks job and lady’s wrath to test it.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is warm-curious—she catalogs domestic griefs the way a scientist labels jars. Syntax lengthens during decryption, mimics elevator climb, then fragments at release: “She lifted the first jar…” Rhythmic control matches pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction shows through imagistic vocabulary unique to her observational bent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “amber lenses catching the strange light” simultaneously anchor object, sensory detail, and foreshadow decryption. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs—groaned, clutched, scattered—propel. One metaphor string frozen→prisms→rainbows is patterned early and repaid at release, avoiding purple overload. Final line offers echo-loop of “ascending servant” without paraphrase, earning cadence payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen-grief-as-preserved-light is fresh synthesis; steampunk elevator + diary decryption via goggles feels specific rather than checklist. Risk is lyric accumulation instead of confrontational climax; the quiet release still crystallizes stakes. Transformation test passes: swap goggles for compass and entire decryption logic collapses. Not 8.8+ because premise still recognizable as “servant uplifts reclusive aristocrat” yet execution elevates it.</comment>
