<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressed it between her fingers… stomach clench”), but the dual-allegiance tension is asserted more than dramatized; the Marinero elders’ refusal is reported, not shown forcing a micro-choice. The closing smile feels unearned after a night of summarized, not sceneworked, negotiation. Competent but not yet crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mosaic of graffiti breadcrumbs teaches its pattern early, transitions are legible, and the final symbol delivers a Charged Poise reweighting with felt cost (“unity in resistance” crystallizes the before/after). Causality is lightly elliptical—Mira’s persuasions are offstage—but the lens stays accumulative/textural and lands cleanly. Orientation is secure by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The raft city is sensuously alive—accordion vs. steel-drum clash, painted hulls, rope bridges—each detail filtered through Mira’s body and agenda. The foundation-stone chip micro-setting re-appears at the end to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room lapses. Could use one more tactile beat of water underfoot to tighten constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. privatization—is signaled early and deepens via graffiti countdown and investor ferry. One meaningful tightening: the new thorn-anchor symbol fuses threat + resistance, foreclosing neutrality. Cost is conceptual but legible; physical stakes remain abstract. Sufficient escalation for this length, though no tangible loss is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><answer>7.6</answer>
<comment>Theme of cultural endurance vs. commodification emerges through carnival imagery and Mira’s bridge-role rather than exposition. The final spiral-inside-anchor image reweights earlier graffiti language, offering resonant non-verbal answer. Avoids moralizing; lets complexity linger. Slight deduction for explicit “hopeful desperation” label earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><answer>8.0</answer>
<comment>Voice carries a percussive carnival rhythm that modulates with fatigue by dawn. Perceptual signature is sharp: Mira notices sound clashes, child-level sightlines, investor linen. Free-indirect diction stays within her likely lexicon. No head-hopping; distance stable. Dialogue snippets are sparse but differentiated when they appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><answer>7.8</answer>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with prepositional fragments, then drum tight: “They might lose everything.” Information density high—one line often sets atmosphere + stakes. No mixed metaphors, but two near-repeats of “kept floating / refused to sink” create minor scaffold. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><answer>8.5</answer>
<comment>Raft-city carnival resisting gentrification feels fresh, and graffiti as encrypted governance minutes is a sharp inflection. The perpetual-motion city as character, not backdrop, lifts the piece above standard “save-our-hood” arcs. Risky compression to 800 words works; no derivative echo. Minor docking for thematic territory that is increasingly common in cli-fi.</comment>
