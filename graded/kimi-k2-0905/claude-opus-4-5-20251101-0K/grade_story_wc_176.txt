<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thumb on the wax, breath on her hands—yet the “letting go” beat is declared more than dramatized. The final stance (she will hum, cast again) crystallizes, but the cost of releasing guilt is told in summary rather than paid in a visible micro-choice. Still, her perceptual signature and layered grief carry the arc convincingly.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rope’s new pattern sings the names, the aurora answers, and Elin becomes “mold and metal both.” The final image reweights the premise—permanence through release—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each braid adjustment accumulates density until the cadence shift of the first sung name.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The sanctum ice, aurora light, and ancient rope fibers are tactile constraints: one careless tug would shatter memory. The micro-setting—the rope’s give, the card’s brittleness—directly shapes the braiding action that sings the names. Environmental specificity charges the final image; remove the aurora current and the logic collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the sound of lost names—tightens when each braid alignment forces a micro-risk of fiber fracture. Agency is renunciation: she forfeits the safety of silence to sing. Cost is visible when the card crumbles and the rope’s new tension hums; this price forecloses the option to remain mute.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of permanence-through-release, crystallized in the final image of dawn ice still singing. No moral is stated; the rope’s reconfigured pattern is the wordless answer. Subtext lives in gesture—warming hands, trembling fingers—rather than declaration. The aurora as living current avoids easy symbolism and instead supplies the literal energy that makes the transcription possible.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elin’s perceptual filter; aurora is “memory refusing to settle,” rope hums “behind her eyes.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-like rhythm, matching the act of braiding. No head-hopping; diction remains within her artisan lexicon of wax, fiber, and metal. Final cadence—“ice sang with names”—lands with resonant compression.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “She cast no bronze that night, melted no wax” condenses two occupations into negation that advances theme. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new tactile or causal information. Metaphors (aurora as memory) stay consistent with the story’s physics of light and resonance. The only hairline slip is the echoed “permanence required first letting go,” a near-paraphrase that slightly dulls the penultimate beat.</comment>

<comment>The lost-wax metaphor is inverted: instead of melting wax to reveal bronze, Elin braids rope to reveal sound—an organic reversal that feels inevitable. The punched-card-as-musical-genome and aurora-as-power-source synthesize craft, tech, and myth without gimmickry. The concept of “technically gentle” remembrance via fiber tension is a fresh inflection on archival fiction. Risk—quiet lyric closure rather than bronze pour—heightens meaning without obscuring causality.</comment>
