<comment>Maya’s interiority is concrete—her fingers closing on the brass fragment, the tablet sketches—and her stoic-wonder tone stays particular. The intern badge relic anchors her identity under pressure, but the “equations for hope” tilt toward label-speak; tightening one sentence to show contradiction inside the wonder would lift this to 8+. The closure choice (present the plan, risk failure) is earned; the sextant warms her palm as visible cost.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, dripping water, frozen boards accrete until the 30% viability equation breaks the pattern and reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks toward the transport with “next equation” in mind; the terminal’s dark patience is the felt cost. One micro-drag: “functionally creative decision” repeats twice in 50 words; trimming one would tighten the cadence and push 8.8+.</comment>

<comment>Environment acts constantly: the vaulted ceiling ducts, floor drains, skylight grit all constrain her measurements and later her presentation logic. The sextant fragment is micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—Gate 47 to atrium to exit—no floating rooms. The 30% capacity figure is the specific constraint that shapes her final gamble; without it the climax would collapse.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—revive the terminal, revive the stars—signalled in paragraph two. Tightening beat: the 30% calculation narrows options from vague hope to concrete, fundable plan; the felt price is the carnival lights “vanished beyond the horizon,” leaving only her equations. No antagonist needed; decay and civic apathy supply coherent pressure. Cost is legible: she risks public rejection and further economic erasure when she steps before the council tomorrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges from逆流 (redirected flows) of water, air, people, purpose—no thesis stated. The sextant’s lost original owner crystallizes the parallel: navigation through uncertainty is human, not heroic. Final image—terminal “patient as stone”—offers resonant reconfiguration: ruins can still channel desire. One soft echo: “equations for hope” nears platitude; had the phrase been cracked open with a micro-memory of her first collapsed bridge model, resonance would deepen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter—air ducts, drips, brass weight. Syntax lengthens during calculation, shortens on exit (“She had a plan now”) to mirror emotional shift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is n/a. Diction stays inside her plausible civil-engineer lexicon until “cathedral of forgotten departures”; the metaphor is earned by preceding architectural detail and pays off in the final “stone” image, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences accumulate texture, then tighten to telegraphic stubs at the turn (“Maya could do the same.”). No scaffold loops; information is dense—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and interiority. Metaphors are coherent: vaulted ceiling → cathedral → stone patience. Minor overgrowth: “functionally creative decision” appears twice; deleting one instance would nudge this into 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-carnival spaceport as civil-engineering patient, not cyberpunk ruin. The sextant shard repurposed as motivational calculus rather than nostalgia prop feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: no external antagonist or dialogue; the bet pays off through accumulative pressure. Conceptual integrity holds—30% viability figure commits to hard-math hope without retreating to metaphoric vagueness.</comment>
