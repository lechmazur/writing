<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation—truth at any cost—drives every beat; the photograph/upload choice is a credible, earned renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“golden borders depicting serpents swallowing their own tails”) and emotionally embodied without therapy-speak. The lone weakness: no contradictory impulse on-page; she never seriously hesitates, so the internal conflict is declarative, not simultaneously enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snow-covered tracks reweight her irreversible act with solemn cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact: petal drop → upload → truth release. One minor scaffold: “comfortable fiction continued its comfortable work” is a paraphrase loop, but it does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-rust-ivy rhythm mirrors Vera’s patient reclamation; the rosebush micro-setting charges the final image when she leaves “dried petals” as memorial. Spatial choreography is tight—platform, ticket booth, desk, door tracked cleanly. Weather shift to snow is causally linked to departure, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—truth versus institutional destruction—tightens once: burn it or publish. The upload is irreversible, foreclosing retreat; the price (Aldric gone, her own erasure) is visible. No escalation beat repeats; pressure accrues throughAccumulative density until the snow silence crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete choice: gilded lies versus unbeautiful truth. The ouroboros motif returns reweighted—truth devours its own tail by destroying the Institute’s good works. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: “tracks that led nowhere and everywhere” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Vera’s scholarly perceptual signature—parchment chemistry, idioms masked in archaic script. Syntax modulates: long cadences for reflection, clipped fragments for action (“She photographed every detail”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description fused to judgment (“ivy crawled like green fire frozen in time”). Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. One minor loop: “comfortable fiction...comfortable work” (already penalized in Q2); otherwise zero scaffold or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forged medieval manuscript as smoking-gun is fresh; linking it to a rogue historian erased from academia gives institutional thriller snap without genre cliché. The rose-petal countdown is an elegant, non-ornamental temporal device. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks, no déjà-vu scenes.</comment>
