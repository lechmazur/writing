<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet competence and outsider stance are well-drawn through tactile grease, scanner calibration, and her preference for machines and aliens over people. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and the final quiet triumph feels proportionate to her solitary labor. Yet the story withholds any micro-choice under real-time opposition; she merely records data she already believed, so the “earned cost” bar is only barely cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: desire (prove sideways time) → twilight window → scanner set-up → anomaly capture → quiet closure with chip pressed to chest. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props; the magnetic nexus is set up, returned, and reweighted at the end. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the data irrevocably reweights her life and the station’s worldview—cost is the solitude she must keep nursing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is selective and sensory: grease scent, amber-violet cloud layers, cold deck air against warm scanner hum. The station’s spider-leg arms and folding cloudweaver wings serve as both spectacle and timekeeping device; spatial choreography stays consistent as Mira moves from hull to deck to quarters. The “mechanically warm” vibration recurs as a tactile anchor that charges the final image. Minor slip: no evidence the environment ever truly threatens or constrains her choices—beauty is vivid but not tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove temporal anomaly—signals early; pressure tightens once as the nexus window shortens and cloudweavers begin to stir. Escalation is gentle but causal: mis-alignment would lose the data, so scanner positioning matters. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—lonely confirmation she must continue bearing alone. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a live trade-off or visible price within the beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as oceanic simultaneity rather than linear river, mirrored by cloudweaver synchronicity and Mira’s own sideways career path. No explicit thesis—meaning accrues through imagery of folding wings, lattice projections, and the final chip against her heart. Final image reweights prior solitude as the price of seeing beyond sequential causality. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether anyone else will ever care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter—machines breathe, wings whisper, magnetic lines shimmer. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful repetition of “mechanically warm” and “sideways” to teach the lyric pattern. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk; technical diction (“holographic principles,” “resonance scanner”) stays within her professional lexicon. Emotional modulation is subtle but present—grease, trembling hands, dream of wings—without ventriloquizing non-POV minds.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop detected (“cloudweavers stirred… began to stir”) but it does not obscure causality or touch closure. High information density: single sentences layer grease, color shift, and emotional stance. Copy is clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Closure line is crisp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest angle is treating relativistic time as sideways ocean perceived by a blue-collar mechanic rather than a physicist. Cloudweaver bioluminescence aligning with EM fields is a lovely, non-anthropocentric calibration device. Concept is not radically new, but the vocational lens and quiet epiphany avoid cliché. Risk is modest; execution feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
