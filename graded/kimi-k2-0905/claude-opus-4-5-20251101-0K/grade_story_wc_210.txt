<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s exile-from-the-Academy motive is cleanly seeded; her seventeen-year solitude is implied rather than shown, but the bottle-warmth micro-choice and the dawn lantern-crafting decision embody her “transformation not preservation” creed with visible cost—she seals her own exile by giving the memories away. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak; the lone flaw is that no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—she never seriously considers keeping the bottle, so the arc is smooth but not jagged. Still, the renunciation is earned and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the stone crumbled → the village fled → Mira acts; because she communes rather than opens → she crystallizes lanterns → the people return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “amber light” reweights the premise—home is now self-lit, not wish-lit—and the cost is felt in her imminent departure. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props; every beat advances knowledge or option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cove’s bioluminescent algae, empty lantern cords, and later the crystallized memory-lanterns are tactile, plot-functional objects that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Selective sensory economy—glow, warmth, weight of amber—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Meets 9+ gate: the lantern-object environment directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can the village live without magic?”—is signaled early and tightens when Mira decides to commune rather than extract. One meaningful deepening: the fisherman’s true wish reframes the problem from “restore stone” to “restore agency.” Cost is legible: Mira forfeits exclusive ownership of the memories and her own settled life. Escalation is causal and suffices for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: gratitude-based community versus dependency on external magic. Subtext lives in the sealed bottle that never needs opening—an unspoken argument against colonialist alchemy. Final image reweights “light” from granted wish to shared memory; no moralizing sentence. The insight feels earned because it is tied to the single fisherman’s wish and Mira’s material response.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistently anchored to Mira’s perceptual filter—warmth of glass, selective attention to lantern sway. Syntax is controlled, slight rhythmic lift in the dawn sequence mirrors emotional rise; no head-hopping. Diction remains within an alchemist’s lexicon without forced academic register. Voice is distinct enough to avoid generic fantasy cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences double-duty (e.g., “amber bottle with no opening—a paradox of glass” sets object + theme). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler stacks. Minor overwrite in “hollow promises” but does not touch closure. Final line “They held light” is crisp, recharges motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the typical “restore the magic” trope into “teach the town to live without it,” a non-obvious reframing. Crystallized memory lanterns feel fresh and specific; the sealed bottle as unopenable archive is a sharp conceptual object. Risky compression of seventeen years into one paragraph pays off by keeping focus on the decisive night. Could edge higher if micro-contradiction had been staged, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
