<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s ache over her erased mother is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to open the wildflower book against the tide-master’s ban shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction—obedience vs. memory hunger—remains active in the salt chamber. The salt-key moment is a hair under-motivated: no prior cue that the book spine itself is a tool, so the lineage “click” feels lucky, not earned. Still, the final step-through-door carries visible cost: she abandons her dock life and lungs herself into the between-world lantern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern’s unnameable colors rewrite the rules of Mira’s universe and her mother’s erasure. Causal chain is tight—coffee pattern → chamber breach → salt key → lantern ignition—each step a because/therefore linkage. One minor bobble: “gravity fluctuated mysteriously” twice in four lines is a loop artifact, but not at closure. Cost is undeniable: the lighthouse door seals behind her, excising her from the town’s ledger exactly as her mother was.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt-crystal walls, body-as-tool (calloused flint hands), and the sphere-as-recurrent-object all constrain tactics: the crystals amplify the sphere’s light, the flint hand strikes the final lantern, the sphere itself is the lock Mira’s bloodline opens. Sensory selection favors salt-glitter silence that literally presses eardrums—perfect POV filter for a lighter used to brine-thick air. Spatial choreography clean: whale → dock → office → chamber → lighthouse summit track without drift. Micro-setting qualifies and charges final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve erased mother—signals in paragraph four and tightens when the sphere cracks open, foreclosing the option to forget again. Agency is continuous: Mira disobeys, offers flowers, palms the salt key, ignites the lantern—each act narrows her retreat back to ordinary dock life. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; cost is the transparent mother on the far side of a one-way door. Fluctuating gravity complicates but does not resolve; the final ignition is pure protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—erasure is displacement, not deletion—emerges from the sphere’s sediment of stolen moments rather than authorial assertion. The whale’s belly as archive and the lantern’s unnameable colors reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the forget-me-nots’ name and the mother’s transparent smile invites lingering ambiguity about what “home” means for memories. Final image of stepping through the door offers resonant non-literal answer: sometimes to restore memory you must accept exile from the remembered world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature: salt fire, brine lungs, flint-calloused palms. Syntax tightens under pressure—“gravity seized them, drawing them into the light”—mirroring pulse spike. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived; internal diction stays within a dock-worker’s ken except for one poetic leap—“silence gleamed like polished glass”—which is ear-justified by the salt chamber. Patterned repetition of “gleaming silence” teaches itself early and pays off in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: a single sentence often sets place, stakes, and metaphor—“The massive creature had washed ashore carrying something… a sphere of compressed light.” No paraphrase loops; “fluctuated mysteriously” is the only stem repeat and it’s minor. Metaphors are coherent: tide-master men / tide-master time. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “gleaming silence.” Micro-movements serve pressure—knees buckle under gravity—no puppet-master clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coffee-ground divination + cetacean data-bank + salt-carceral lighthouse feels inevitable in hindsight. The whale as wandering hard-drive for deleted lives transforms familiar trope into specific cosmology. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when the lantern’s colors reprice reality. No close echoes; even “step through the door” avoids Narnia cliché by trading wardrobe for salt-iron lantern. Transformation test fails if relocated: the dock, brine, and lantern are irreplaceable engines of meaning.</comment>
