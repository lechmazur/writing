<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-rooted vocation and her father’s inherited obsession give her a sharp, idiosyncratic interior lens; every micro-choice (lifting the telescope, christening a cloud) grows from that wound. The final “speak back” moment crystallizes her shift from passive cataloguer to active translator of sky-memory, paying the cost of permanent exile. Interiority stays concrete—frost on glass, telescope weight—avoiding label-speak. One minor slip: the causality between naming clouds and internal change is asserted more than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each newly named cloud adds density until the closing nacreous image reweights the premise—wholeness is solitude completed, not connection restored. The broken tether is the single causal rupture; everything else is pattern-building that pays off when Elena closes her notebook and “speaks back,” a CR with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the phrase “had proven it” claims rather than shows the atmospheric-archive thesis, a micro-tell that keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The frost-rimmed gondola window, brass telescope, and ice-crystal nacreous clouds are tactile, cold, and specific; they constrain action—she can’t open the window, the telescope’s weight steadies her tremor. Sky layers function as vertical geography, limiting escape and forcing the emotional confrontation. Final image of telescope catching starlight recharges every prior mention. Micro-setting (notebook pages “soft as old skin”) anchors body-in-space without drifting into catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the sky remembers—tightens through each cloud baptism; the accumulating catalogue is the escalating cost: she forfeits return, salary, human voice. No external antagonist needed; pressure is atmospheric and existential. The final cumulonimbus memoriam forces the recognition that her own grief is now archived aloft, a tightening that forecloses re-entry into ordinary life. Price is legible but could be sharper if one cloud naming physically risked the gondola.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory is not storage but weather—shared, unstable, precipitating. Subtext whispers that cataloguing is surrogate mourning; the named clouds are headstones no one else can read. Final nacreous transcendentis reconfigures the premise: wholeness equals exile. No moralizing, only an imagic answer that invites re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a meteorologist’s precision filtered through bereaved daughter synaesthesia: “threads of unspoken apology,” “quietly explosive.” Syntax lengthens with humidity, shortens when barometer drops—prose as barograph. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; it stays singular and weather-obsessed. Telescope, notebook, and frost recur as tactile refrain, rhythmically anchoring the lyric flight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with cloud buildup—long cumulus clauses, then abrupt cirrus fragments. Figurative layering is high but patterned; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “empty spaces remember” appears three times with near-identical phrasing; trimming one would tighten. Otherwise zero paraphrase churn, strong verbs (“spooled,” “snapped,” “shimmered”), and no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Emotional meteorology feels fresh: clouds as grief archive reverses the pathetic fallacy without flattening it. Inherited brass telescope repurposed as stethoscope to sky avoids steampunk cliché. Risk—lyric catalog as plot—pays off because closure reweights the list-making as self-condemnation to perpetual drift. Specificity of cloud Latin fused with private grief creates a voice unlikely to be mistaken for another writer.</comment>
