<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s grief and spatial gift are cleanly embodied: she kneels, palms mushrooms, weeps. The “permeable barriers” epiphany is earned by repeated sensory contact with the glowing membranes and her brother’s notebooks; the final stance—holding presence and absence together—costs her tears and tomorrow’s new duties. Interior contradiction is light but present: she arrives to “let something out” yet ends by letting everything in. Competence (intrusion detection) is repurposed rather than struggled against, so the +9 gate is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the red laser dissolving into impossible glow reweights “letting go” from rupture to permeability. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cluster of mushrooms thickens the emotional substrate until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in the line “she finally let herself weep” after the ghost-mushroom epiphany. One hairline slip: the Estate/property legalities are skimmed; no constraint from that quarter shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop but physics: wavelengths that “shouldn’t exist” actively teach the permeability thesis. The laser tool and ghost-mushroom spores constrain Maya’s final metaphor and her literal path through the rows. Spatial choreography is pristine—rows, thresholds, membranes track cleanly. 9+ gate met: the mushrooms’ glow charges the final image of permeable grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightens once: from wanting release to accepting permeable retention. The meaningful turn is micro but decisive: pressing the laser button the second time after decoding the notebooks. Cost is felt (tears, tomorrow’s obligations) yet not materially lossy;持久 constraints are absent. Sufficient for 8-band, shy of 8.8+ which wants a steeper price or option foreclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: letting go = becoming permeable, not severing. The mushrooms’ spectral light reconfigures grief into continuum rather than absence. Subtext operates in silence and glow; no character states the moral. Final image reweights all prior sibling distance into a living membrane—resonant, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Maya’s skin; perceptual signature is color-wavelength synesthesia fused with network-architect spatial sense. Rhythm breathes—long lyrical sentences for cavern glow, clipped fragments when she presses the laser. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing) is internally licensed by her tech background.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer light, color, and metaphor without synonym churn. Opening line anchors stakes and glow; final line resolves by image (“quiet wildfire”). One mixed-metaphor watch: “wildfire of luminescence” is thermally odd for underground fungi yet reads as deliberate oxymoron. No scaffolds or loops; information density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cybersecurity spatial logic × bioluminescent mycelial membranes = grief permeability. Conceptual risk (impossible colors, spore teleportation) is held by emotional truth. Not quite 9 because premise could be re-skinned with other “network” professions; still, mushroom-as-grief-interface feels non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
