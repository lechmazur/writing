<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mora’s interiority is concrete, haunted, and specific to her exile; her contradictory need to test the Council’s walls while still privately doubting is dramatized in the moment she presses quartz to wrist. Micro-choice—paraphrasing rather than copying—turns aesthetic instinct into tactical rebellion with visible cost (the atrium’s awakening, the lake crack). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; head-count stays coherent. Earned stasis lands cleanly: she stays, reads, accepts moth-circled exposure—exile’s wound reopened but now chosen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of quartz-hum, light-shift, and lake-crack layers density until cobalt glow and moth arrival reconfigure meaning. Closure—Charged Poise—arrives when lantern-moths circle the self-lit atrium: sacred redefined as approachable, cost felt in irreversible exposure. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Single transition (memory shard ≤20 %) is cued by concrete quartz touch. Persistent constraint: poetry ban residual; her voice could still be re-criminalized, a price kept alive in the humming after-image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake double each other, forcing Mora to read her own reflection as text; quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting that literally vibrates syntax into light—an environmental tool that alters her poetic method. Cold air narrows sensory palette to crystalline sound/blue, matching exile’s austerity. Spatial choreography holds as she moves from threshold → colonnade → window → reading spot. Weather (lake crack) evolves causally with voiced verses, sealing causality between inner speech and outer world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can art reclaim sacred space without re-triggering ban? Pressure tightens when quartz responds—sound-to-light shift proves words still dissolve walls, foreclosing retreat. Agency: she decides to read aloud, accepting possible re-exile; lake crack externalizes cost. Escalation is textural: humming intensifies, moths arrive, boundary visibly opens. No coincidence; every turn is triggered by her paraphrased verses. Price legible—once glow spreads, silence cannot be restored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: sacred = accessible, not forbidden. Subtext carried in moth imagery—fragile survivors drawn to outlawed light. Paraphrase vs. copy becomes ethical stance on art as living renewal. Final image reweights earlier exile: same words, new syntax, now inviting rather than demanding. Resonant ambiguity: will Council re-seal? Uncertainty lingers, charging poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains psychic distance tight to Mora’s perceptual lens: “like a ghost remembering its bones,” “read its surface the way others read manuscripts.” Syntax grows cadenced, almost chant-like under quartz hum, mirroring poetry’s rhythm. No head-hopping; diction stays within her aesthetic vocabulary (“lantern-moth hush,” “cloud-shadow poet”). Compression taught early (“cobalt atrium stood…”) and paid off in glowing final paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “humming quartz colonnade” does triple duty—setting, tool, metaphor. Varied sentence length accelerates with pressure, breathes during reflection. No mixed metaphors; cobalt / twilight / glass stack remains coherent. Minor loop: “had…had…” in para 2, but momentum recovers immediately. Final line lands on concrete image, not abstraction, satisfying closure read-aloud test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: exile-poet returning to weaponized architecture that literally transduces voice into light. Moth survivors reframe “forbidden” into “lamp-worthy,” a non-obvious moral re-pricing. Conceptual risk—poetry as dissolving force—earned by materializing it in quartz physics and lake fracture. Specificity of “cloud-shadow” metaphor prevents generic rebellion template.</comment>
