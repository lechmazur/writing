<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s “creeping normality noticer” identity is concrete—she tracks foreclosures, names dust motes, moves objects—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the final realization that attention itself is sanctification is lovely yet costless, so the arc feels more observed than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the house’s “exhale” reweights the premise—attention, not ritual, sanctifies. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of displaced objects and accumulating hush tightens once, then crystallizes in the final image. Causality is intact, cost is felt in the shard’s mingled scent, and the ending reconfigures meaning without tidy summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay mud, softened porch boards, amber streetlight, and the orris shard’s iris scent are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final breath of the house. The micro-setting of the Whitmore kitchen table anchors the decisive beat; the shard’s fragrance charging the closing silence satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no sensory checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can attention resurrect abandoned space?—tightens once when Marina grasps that displacement equals witnessing. Pressure grows texturally: objects moved, hush accumulated, scent released. The cost is the absorbed silence she now carries, but because the house cannot push back, escalation is moderate, not fierce.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sanctification through sustained attention to what society forgets. Subtext lives in gesture—cup moved, shoe relocated—never sermonized. Final image of the orris now mingled with Whitmore history offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marina’s perceptual signature: “gap-toothed with foreclosures,” “shard of hush.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with the bay’s fog, then compresses at the epiphany. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; voice modulation supports the hushed blaze tone without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech, propelling the accumulative design. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One paraphrase loop (“the simple act of noticing what others had stopped seeing”) is minor; it doesn’t touch closure. High density, zero scaffolding artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: haunting as attentive conservation—Marina’s displacement method turns foreclosed real estate into living memory. Orris shard repurposed as olfactory time-capsule feels specific, not quirky. Risk is quiet but coherent; no derivative premise penalty. Could edge higher if the town’s economic collapse pressed back more viscerally.</comment>
