<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—"ache with something adjacent to memory"—and her stoic endurance feels lived-in, but the arrival of the child flips her from lone guardian to soft rescuer without visible internal friction. The grandmother’s lullaby-echoed equations are a strong inherited motive, yet the choice to fold spacetime for the girl reads more saintly than costly. We never see her relinquish a concrete want, so the "unlit corner" creed stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage is lyric-loose rather than tight: the anomaly child appears by "wave functions bent wrong," not through Mira’s prior action, so the inciting incident is coincidence, not because/therefore. The midpoint folding scene supplies a decisive micro-turn—Mira actively charms the field—but the mechanism is hand-waved in poetic formula. Closure lands on Earned Stasis: she keeps walking, now carrying the extra branch of possibility; cost is the dune’s dimming flowers, felt but not personal. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern break rather than plot-gear turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The glowing dune is sensory cinema—visual phosphor, pulsing sand, audible blossom frequencies—yet never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography stays clean: summit found, pocket warmth, footprints filling with pollen. The chess clock and flowers act as micro-settings that constrain choice (she times her charm by their simultaneous midnight strike). Environment literally seeds the rescued future, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—"every lost possibility matters"—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: no time limit, no antagonist, no resource at risk. Escalation is a single deepening at the crest when she decides to stabilize the child; the cost (flowers dim) is environmental, not personal. Agency is present but low-heat; the story favors wonder over jeopardy. Situational lens suffices, yet the tightening is modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as conservation of lost futures; the refrain "every lost possibility matters" is never moralized, only dramatized through the rescued child and dimming dune. The midnight chess clocks quietly reprice possibility itself—time that runs backward or stands still—without overt thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: she offers her hand, not a speech. Final image of pollen-filled footprints resonates as a quiet archive entry, resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira’s sinew: "boots sinking," "chest ache," perceptual filter tuned to quantum lullabies. Diction stays within her colloquial range—no academic leakage—even when folding wave functions. Rhythm modulates: long sand-dune sentences breathe, then shorten at the summit encounter. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; the child’s speech is brief, distinct, and child-simple ("I fell through").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is strong—varied openings, no scaffold loops—but figurative density borders purple in clusters: "fractured lullaby," "quantum containers," "probability itself." Mixed metaphors stay internally consistent (clocks/flowers/time), yet the accumulation drags immediacy in the folding beat. Minor paraphrase echo: "walked the freight lines / walked the phosphorescent ridge." Otherwise high density and clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing quantum multiverse with eco-fantasy dunes and a chess-clock metronome feels fresh; no genre template maps directly. The "occasionally everywhere" descriptor is ownable coinage that reweights setting into concept. Risk is high—lyric sf flash—but coherence holds. The rescued timeline branch as cargo is a lovely inversion of freight, transforming logistics into metaphysics.</comment>
