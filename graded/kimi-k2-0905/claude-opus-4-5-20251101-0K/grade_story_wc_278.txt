<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—preserving every lost sound yet unable to heal her own bloodline—drives every beat; the micro-choice to map the letters onto the chamber (not stars) crystallizes the hierarchy of values and triggers the earned release that ends the story. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off stage, but the multi-generational conflict is still rendered as crucible. One minor slip: “she had been searching for a way to send messages backward” is summary rather than embodied moment; still, the final heartbeat-sync is a felt cost that satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the amber cools, the dissonance quiets, and the dawn tastes of forgiveness—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but each added texture (amber warmth, meteor hush, folded hour) intensifies the stake until the final cadence shift releases it. The orientation anchors (who=Vera, where=laboratory, when=the fold) appear within the first 90 words and are re-evoked at the payoff. No plot artifact obscures the emotional causality; the cost is the cooling amber itself—ancient firmware forever still.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is rendered through micro-setting: the crystalline walls drink laughter, the central chamber feeds the fold, and the amber’s prehistoric warmth syncs with heartbeat—each detail constrains or enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory and tactile (humming chambers, cooling amber) reflecting Vera’s professional ear. Spatial choreography is clean: desk drawer → palm → chest → chamber. The meteor hush outside mirrors the internal quietude at the end, but the mirroring emerges through action, not overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of three-generation guilt—is signaled in the first third and tightens through each frequency translation. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the amber insect twitches, narrowing Vera’s options to one final tattoo; cost is the amber’s death-stillness and her own chest-release. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: every salvaged sound adds weight until the fold is forced to reweight meaning. No reversal is needed; the stance crystallization is the quiet dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation as delayed love, translation as forgiveness. The amber’s firmware literalizes the metaphor of outdated emotional code, and the final “dawn that tasted…like forgiveness” offers a non-literal, sensory answer to the central question. Subtext resides in gesture—amber pressed to chest, letters laid out as light-points—never exposition. No moral is declared; the resonance is felt in the cooled amber and the birds’ return, a CR that reweights all prior lost sounds as now found.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and particular: time curls like smoke remembering flame, meteor hush ripples the fold, dawn tastes of forgiveness—Vera’s synesthetic ear shapes every line. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences accumulate during reflection, then fragment at the twitch of the amber. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free-indirect texture stays clean; “impossible, but Vera had stopped believing in impossible…” keeps psychic distance tight yet lyrical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: “constellation of her own design… each envelope a point of light” compresses setting, motive, and action into one clause. Mixed-metaphor risk is limited because all vehicles (fold, smoke, firmware) orbit the same resonance/translation conceit. One minor loop: “the amber had arrived… When Vera had opened” repeats “had” in adjacent lines, but the cadence is purposeful past-perfect framing. Final image lands clean with no artifactual overlay; rhythm breathes out on the last sentence to match the release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of amber-as-haunted-firmware that translates baby-cries into inter-generational apology is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in folding time and giving an insect agency, yet the closure stays legible under Accumulative lens. Specificity anchors the fantastical: Victorian desk drawer, forty-three unsent letters, the exact answering-machine fragment. No trope is stock; even “meteor hush” re-infuses a tired image with fresh sensory cost.</comment>
