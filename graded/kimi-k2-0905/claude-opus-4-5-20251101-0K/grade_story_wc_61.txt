<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Veloris’s memory-keeper identity is vivid and embodied (“carried their sorrows like seeds”), but her final turn from observer to transmitter is stated more than dramatized; we see no interior contradiction or micro-choice that costs her something visible on the page, so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: gear encodes resonance → sonar teaches reception → Veloris transmits → garden re-broadcasts; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (light without fire now possible) with cosmic-scale cost. One soft spot: the “pattern-break” moment is compressed into a single paragraph rather than a dramatized beat, so the tightening feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula flowers shift from ornament to tool—they store starlight and release it under resonance—so setting directly enables the climax; the crystalline petal that falls at transmission is the charged image. Spatial anchoring could be sharper (garden’s edges, Veloris’s bodily relation to flowers), but the micro-setting (gear-in-palm, petal descent) constrains the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can light be shared without fire?”—is signaled early; escalation arrives when the gear’s hidden frequency is discovered, narrowing options to resonance-only. The cost is conceptual (annihilation averted off-stage) rather than personal, so pressure feels cosmic-not-immediate; still, one meaningful deepening occurs and forecloses the fire path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cyclical civilizational suicide via fire versus an alternative physics of light. The refrain “across the quiet sigh of falling petals” reweights at closure, turning decorative time-marker into transmission clock. No moralizing; the question stays open whether any world will heed the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-omniscient voice sustains a luminous, distant telescope tone; diction (“celestial flowers… geometric hearts”) stays within the poetic register without purple drift. Syntax modulates—long breathy sentences for drift, clipped fragments for gear-click—keeping rhythm aligned to emotional temperature. One POV quibble: “she understood now why she had come” edges into retrospective explanation, slightly softening present immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet musical; figurative layering (“colors that existed only in the spaces between stars”) is patterned early and paid off in the resonance release. No synonym loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“pages of her consciousness”) is minor. Final sentence cadence mirrors opening, giving satisfying circular ear-feel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—steampunk gear + cosmic garden + sonar-as-philosophy—feels fresh and inevitable; the premise transforms familiar “civilizations burn” trope into a physics-of-light intervention. Risky lyric density is held by consistent metaphoric grammar; no hedge toward conventional plot beats. Could edge higher if the transmitted light’s first impact were shown rather than forecast.</comment>
