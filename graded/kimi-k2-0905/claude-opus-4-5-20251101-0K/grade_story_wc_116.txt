<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s renunciation of certainty and her embrace of witness-over-action is consistent and embodied; the final image of her “breathing back” the catacombs crystallizes a lifetime of micro-choices. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc leans contemplative rather than crucible-tested, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts her eventual dissolution into the archive with visible cost—“she would become part of the accumulated silence.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the final paragraph reweights the premise under the same regenerative silence that opened the piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The obsidian refuge’s fractured reflections and the river’s voice physically constrain her final stance; the micro-setting of the origami swan in her palms charges the last beat. Every sensory note is filtered through her witness-poetics, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: the discovery of the swan shifts her from passive wandering to deliberate documentation without disturbance. The cost is the surrender of voice and agency—she “lets the water’s voice replace her own”—a renunciation legible under Accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inseparability of decay and genesis; the final image of reciprocal breathing offers a non-literal answer to the implicit question of how to live with impermanence. No moralizing—just the reweighted silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unwavering—moss-softened spines, constellations of moisture—rendered in rhythmic, cadenced syntax that mirrors her loosening grip. No filter-verb stacks; every compression is taught by line one and paid off in the final river-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image and concept without restatement. Figurative control stays precise—“silt gathered at a river’s bend until something new could grow”—and never clutters the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The regenerative archive sustained entirely through witness, not rescue, feels fresh; the origami swan as non-verbal instruction manual is a specific, non-obvious device. Risk in abandoning linear plot for textural accretion pays off because the closure reweights the premise rather than dissipating.</comment>
