<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aldric’s gaunt obsession, three-day grime, and “tears cutting tracks” embody his motive; the final laugh-salt-joy triad crystallizes a credible renunciation of sterile perfection. Micro-choices—pressing forehead to cold glass, trembling hands threading silver wire—keep interiority concrete. The only slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“This is flawed genesis”) without immediate embodied cost; still, contradiction pulses in scene and the hybrid creature lands as visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: forbidden archives → egg → Resonance Reconstruction → flawed birth; each “because” tightens options until copper birds stutter. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—palace sways, citizens scream-laugh, Aldric tastes salt. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The final image of “living heart finally remembering rhythm” reweights the rule-set, meeting Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Frozen tear” palace anchored to “bones of dead gods” immediately grounds scale and stakes; geothermal winds sway the suspended city, guiding final swaying-heart image. Micro-setting—the egg’s velvet-lined box and brass-silver apparatus—constrains every assembly move. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: cold glass, copper glow, salt taste. Environment not postcard: it creaks under new resonance, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite wonder in a mechanized world—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation follows causal beats: each alchemy step risks palace security and ancestral taboo; the activation tightens to irreversible light-flood. Cost is visible: mechanical birds break orbit, citizens scream, Aldric weeps. Agency remains his; coincidence complicates but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>“Flawed genesis” emerges organically from every beat; the closing axiom “Genesis was always flawed” is earned, not sermonized. Subtext coils around irreversible hybridity—flame-metal feathers, scream-laughter citizens—refusing tidy moral. The final taste of salt-joy crystallizes an ambiguous new covenant with imperfection. No thematic echo sentences; meaning arises from image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Aldric; perceptual signature is tactile-gothic: “matted tangles across eyes that burned,” “velvet-lined box,” “copper wings catching bioluminescent glow.” Syntax grows compressed under pressure—fragmented clauses as shell cracks. No head-hopping; diction remains within prince’s educated lexicon. Final “bedraggled prince laughed” retains voice while shifting to mythic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from long dream-sentence to staccato activation: “Light erupted… shell cracked.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (“palace hung like a frozen tear”) is singular and paid off. Information density high—feather-crystal-memory nodes compressed in one clause. One mixed metaphor risk: “bones of dead gods” beside “frozen tear” but consonant in scale. Closure image clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reviving extinction via alchemy-mechanics is fresh; “Resonance Reconstruction” feels inevitable yet unfamiliar. The hybrid phoenix-machine is not a twist but a conceptual repricing born from stated axioms. Risky lyricism (“cavern’s tear,” “quaking reverie”) is balanced by tactile engineering detail. Transformation test: story collapses if creature is purely phoenix or purely machine—only this mongrel births the new order.</comment>
