<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“calcified around her heart like salt crusts”) and the final renunciation—choosing cultivation over preservation—carries visible cost in the tears she “had forgotten how to cry.” Micro-choices (descending, placing the dial, watching the hatchlings) track her pivot cleanly. The seven-century backstory is efficiently anchored to present stimuli, but the leap from solitary grief to instant nurturer feels lightly telescoped; a single intermediate beat of hesitation or self-recoil would sharpen credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: reincarnation memory triggers descent → sundial activates stones → creatures birth → Mira rewrites purpose. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: isolation is reframed as bridge-building with tangible cost (the new manuscript she begins, the sleeping bodies she guards). Orientation is swift—who/where/when fixed by line 3. A modest elasticity: the sundial’s mechanics are stated rather than demonstrated, so the moment of “push” is slightly abstract, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal library is atmospheric yet functional: mist currents shelve and retrieve manuscripts, forcing Mira to navigate moving stacks. Atomically reflective stones are not mere light show—they diffract possibilities and literally spawn new life, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory triangulation is tilted toward the ethereal (sound of stone hum, newborn chirp frequency) but remains specific and filtered through Mira’s grief-sharpened attention. Spatial choreography is flawless across spiral stairs, central pool, and cloud floor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are existential loneliness vs. future creation; the tightening occurs when the stone circle’s light fractures into “winged shapes,” transforming theoretical possibility into vulnerable beings Mira must choose to nurture or ignore. Agency is present—she places the dial, stays to write the guide—yet the decisive turn is partly gifted by the circle rather than wrested from her. Cost is legible (perpetual caretaking renewed, grief un-retired), but the external catalyst softens the band relative to purely self-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via image pattern: salt-crusted isolation dissolves into tidal nurturance; the manuscript she begins literalizes translation of solitude into strength. Subtext is carried through object handling—sundial shifts from memorial to incubator—avoiding explicit thesis. The final line reframes “preservation” as “welcome,” a resonant non-literal answer. A trace of overt statement (“Independence was not the absence…”) nicks the top edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hugs Mira’s perceptual bias: mist currents “arrive,” stones “hum,” chirp hits her chest. Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under shock (“Not leviathans… something new”). No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Register stays lyrical yet internally consistent; only a single elevated clause—“atomically reflective”—leans toward textbook, quickly absorbed by the magic system.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: short percussive clauses for descent, elongation for creature arrival. Metaphors are precise (isolation “calcified… like salt crusts”) and non-muddled. Information density is high—sentence 1 shelves setting, character, and stakes. No loops, filler, or scaffold detected; the single “time is not a cage” aphorism is warranted as remembered dialogue rather than narrator intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantastical library above cloudline plus extinct sky-leviathans gives fresh altitude to post-extinction caretaker trope. The brass sundial as door-opener rather than time-keeper flips expected function. Risk is moderate—emotional stakes ride on miniature creatures rather than world-ending peril—yet specificity (atomically reflective stones birthing forearm-sized draconids) keeps it from feeling safe. A hair more could be stripped from orphan-myth familiarity, but choices feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
