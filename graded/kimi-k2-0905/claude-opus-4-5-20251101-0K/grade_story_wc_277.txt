<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margaret’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs inherited protectiveness—are alive in the scene: she handles the burgundy-stained nib, traces the math, then chooses partial disclosure. The micro-choice to write “something in between” crystallises her father’s orbit of regret as her own, with visible cost: complicity in silence. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the laugh that carries “solemn playfulness” is embodied, not declared. Flaws (paralysis, sudden empathy for paternal paternalism) complicate the final beat and feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the journalist’s call raises doubt, Margaret assumes contradiction, therefore searches, finds the asteroid miss distance, and so decides to soft-lie. Orientation is clean by line 8; the copper dome above clouds is instant anchor. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—she commits to inherited secrecy, foreclosing full disclosure. Persistent constraint: the burgundy nib she lifts at start is the same tool she writes with at end, making the choice tactile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory-as-crown image is selective and atmospherically dominant; copper dome, ink-stained notebooks, and slit of pale light filter through Margaret’s gaze. The rosewood nib serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—she literally writes the future with her father’s instrument. Spatial choreography is flawless: desk → charts → slit → clouds below. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism: tarnished green dome = inherited moral corrosion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to expose or conceal the near-miss—tightens when she realises the asteroid passes tomorrow. One meaningful escalation: verification of the 17,000 km miss converts abstract guilt to immediate ethical fork. Agency is decision, not action heroics; the cost is lifelong complicity. Coincidence (asteroid timing) complicates rather than rescues; tension stays internal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus mercy—emerges from the inverse logic of proof by contradiction applied to filial love. The burgundy ink reweights from “error” to “loving lie,” re-pricing the moral calculus without moralising. Final image of invisible orbits offers Conceptual Repricing: society keeps orbiting because some trajectories stay unspoken. Ambiguity is productive; reader must decide if silence is kindness or repeat of patriarchal control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Margaret; perceptual signature is mathematical, almost proof-based (“proof by contradiction—she remembered that much”). Syntax glides from long atmospheric sentences to staccato realisations (“Tomorrow.”). No head-hop; focalization disciplined. Prose rhythm mirrors emotional intake: slow circling of notebooks, then abrupt laughter that breaks the cadence. Diction stays within her educated but non-astronomer lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: “orbits of regret mapped in burgundy ink” does character, theme, and image in one stroke. No synonym loops; “observatory” never repeated mechanically. Metaphors are coherent—copper dome as forgotten crown, cities like circuits. Final sentence avoids drumbeat by varying clause length. One minor scaffold: “she decided” could be cut, but it occurs mid-story, not in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Father–daughter inheritance of editorial silence feels fresh precisely because the reveal is mundane: he hid nothing except proximity. Synthesis of newspaper empire as orbital-mechanics of censorship is non-obvious and specific. Risk is quiet ending; it pays off by reweighting silence itself as orbital force. Premise avoids cliché of heroic whistle-blower, opting for tragic continuity.</comment>
