<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her theatrical self-narration externalizes grief while preserving the mandated blank face, a sharp contradiction shown on every beat. The micro-choice to keep carving figures (and the dried flowers) is concrete, repeated, and charged with cost; the 17th figure crystallizes the private ritual’s toll. Moral ambiguity is embodied, not labeled: she knowingly violates the law yet preserves a gentler humanity. Only the final “almost smiled” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, a hairline slip that keeps this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last line re-weights the whole performance/hush dialectic, leaving the cost of perpetual blankness legible. Accumulative lens holds—each narrated chore, new carving, and drone pass thickens the texture until the final image detonates. Causality is tight: because she stays, because she narrates, because she carves, the hush becomes weaponized compliance. The 120-word orientation anchor is met cleanly; no disorientation debt.</comment>

<comment>The turbines’ rhythmic shadows function as micro-clock and panopticon, directly constraining her staging choices; every time she must freeze her face as the blade sweeps. Dried bouquet and pine curls act as micro-setting—handled, cracked, scattered—each state change forces the next covert beat. Farmhouse isolation and neighborless fields are sketched with three swift strokes yet decisively remove external rescue. Final image of brittle petals reflected in blank window glass recharges both objects, earning the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will her private grief ritual survive the drone eye?—tightens each sweep of the blade. No reversals needed; pressure escalates by texture: bouquet crumbles, figurines multiply, turbines keep vigil. Agency is renunciation/steadfastness; carving the 17th figure is the visible price. Cost is unmistakable: the unsmiling jaw muscles, the splintered fingertips we never see bandaged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of performed blankness becoming authentic inner hush; no thesis is stated. Narrating mundane tasks into drama enacts the privatization of grief under totalitarian joy—an angle that feels fresh yet inevitable. The closing “almost smiled” is the only thematic echo, but it lands as image, not assertion. Reader left to revalue every earlier “blank” moment: complicity or quiet revolt?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Performer’s idiom is sustained—measured theatrical cadence, script-like stage directions (“our heroine returns inside”)—without syntactic monotony. Perceptual signature filters every object through dramaturgy (shadows = broken clock hands; wood curls = unshed tears). No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Filter verbs (“she wondered”) are few and motivated by narrator persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density; most sentences do double duty (action + emotional translation). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (turbine blades as clock, as surveillance). Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric paragraph on “because” accelerates toward close, then clipped final line. Opening and closing lines are pruned to nerve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Mandatory happiness” dystopia is familiar, but the fusion with lone performer narrating her own silent rebellion is a fresh synthesis. Whittled figurines as clandestine cemetery, wind-turbine shadows as time+surveillance—details particularize the template. Risk lies in quiet, almost plotless pattern; pays off via cumulative charge. Could edge higher if concept probed societal implications beyond personal coping.</comment>
