<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s gift is vividly embodied (“heard her mother’s buried grief…”) and her renunciation of solitude is earned by the cascade she triggers. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat of “peace” is stated rather than shown in body or choice, blunting cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hears stolen dreams → finds collector → releases stardust → village re-awakens. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rusted instrument and falling “first new star” make the cost of her solitude legible without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mountain peak, archway, and bloated brass instrument are tactile and constrain action (she must climb, must turn the dial). Aurora shifts from curtain to “crimson and indigo” celebration, mirroring release; final image of one free star is charged by prior visual grammar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore creativity—tightens when she sees the collector’s “gossamer threads” and realizes the valley’s starvation. One decisive turn of the dial forecloses her option to keep the power; cost is felt in the instant collapse of the tool and her own exile on the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reversal of hoarding: creativity as communal starlight, not private property. Final re-pricing—rust where treasure was—lets the reader feel the price without moralizing; ambiguity remains in Elara’s solitary awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception (“colors she could almost taste”). Rhythm swells with aurora, then breathes in the quiet rust close; no head-hop or register drift. One clause of therapy-speak (“she had not experienced since childhood. Peace.”) is a micro-slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences carry double duty (“creativity trapped like birds in amber”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadowed rapture of the aurora’s embrace”) flirt with purple but serve the lyric pulse; no loops or scaffold detected. Final rust image lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stardust-as-inspiration is familiar, yet the astronomical collector that diverts meteors from destiny is a fresh, grounded mechanism. Risky lyric elevation commits fully and pays off in the rusted dissolution; specificity of “first new star” reweights the entire myth without cliché.</comment>
