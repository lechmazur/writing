<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is tactile and profession-specific; every micro-choice (kneeling to read ice cracks, pressing palms to walls) grows from her mapkeeper identity. Her body’s obsolete “ripple-marks” externalize the central loss and charge the final mapping act with earned cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ test narrowly misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the hush-bloom reconfigures meaning when the echo-stone’s total absorption becomes an on-page image of reclaimed silence. Causal chain holds—ice-crack reading → draft discovery → chamber entry → silence tool activation—each step foreclosing prior options. Cost is visible in her “earned exhaustion” and the foregone reliability of her body’s knowledge. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off in final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as micro-setting: wall geometry literally absorbs sound, constraining her final tactic of mapping a refuge. Ripple-marked forearms and echo-stone serve as embodied setting extensions that charge the closing image. Spatial choreography is flawless across the squeeze, kneel, palm-press sequence. Environment evolves causally with energy-being disruptions shown through new ice and crystalline seals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens when every echo fails. The spiral ice-crack pattern delivers the single meaningful deepening that narrows options toward the hidden chamber. Cost is felt in her obsolete skin-knowledge and the final bodily exhaustion. Agency is sustained attention and mapping labor rather than a single decisive act; under Accumulative lens this suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mapkeeper purpose: obsolete maps become guides to silence, not sound. Final image of “the quiet held her, and she held it back” offers non-literal repricing of silence as mutual stewardship. No overt thesis statements; meaning accrues through tactile particulars. Avoids sentimentality by keeping exhaustion and loss foregrounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: cave textures are felt through Vera’s ripple-marked skin, light is “softened to a pale glow,” silence is “pregnant.” Rhythm modulates from groaning caves to final hush-cadence without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to evaluate. POV remains tight third with no leakage; inference is modest and earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limber: “She had not conquered the storm. She had simply found its eye…” compresses arc and theme in two sentences. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs are specific—stone “pulsed,” walls “whispered through touch alone.” Final line achieves resonant brevity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes alien sound-colonization with subterranean acoustic cartography; both strands feel inevitable together. Risk of “bloom of hush” as literal silence-chamber pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of ripple-marks as sensory tools and ice-crack spiral as pathfinder freshens familiar quest structure. Energy beings remain indifferent, averting anthropomorphic cliché.</comment>
