<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s patience is credibly embodied in the slow decoding of the rope, but her interiority stays safely on one note; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her resolve, so the final “she would not let that happen” feels pre-declared rather than earned under pressure. The fulgurite necklace is a concrete cue for inherited duty, yet its only micro-choice is a concluding touch to the throat—insufficient to reveal a hierarchy of values when the stakes never seriously diverge from her opening goal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The accumulative lens holds: each knot adds density until the final pattern crystallizes an invitation, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the hidden weavers endure only if a new listener keeps decoding. Causality is clean (rope → knowledge → next step) and orientation is swift; the only minor slack is the off-stage “test” that never jeopardizes her path, so the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Golden dock, dissolving snow-flakes, and tarred hemp fibers are filtered through Mira’s collector gaze; every tactile detail advances the arc of deciphering. The fulgurite against her throat re-appears in the final paragraph to charge the lighthouse-lit image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that constrains the closing stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared early—knowledge will vanish—and the middle sequence steadily deepens the archive she is recovering, but no external or internal obstacle ever endangers the project; the only pressure is the abstract passage of time. Because options only widen (she learns, then learns more), escalation is present yet low-temperature; the cost is prospective, not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation survives through transformation—sand to glass, knots to meaning, solitary reader to future community. The closing image of snow erasing footprints while the lighthouse sweeps “nothing” lets the concept resonate without moralizing, though the absence of a concrete setback keeps the aftereffect more cerebral than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s haptic attention; diction is restrained, marine, and winter-cold, with rhythmic alternation between short observations and longer sinuous sentences that mimic rope spirals. No POV leakage or register drift; the voice is consistent and purposeful under the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, image-rich, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold appears (“snow continued falling…snow and silence and the faint impression”) in the coda, too late to blunt closure. Metaphors stay coherent (river deltas, lightning glass) and syntactic variety propels the slow reveal without purple intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “knots-as-manuscript” conceit feels fresh, and the inversion of a fisherman’s tool into a library offers a specific cultural angle rather than generic folk-magic. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric meditation in place of jeopardy—but the synthesis of botanical collector + maritime archive + winter isolates a memorable perspective.</comment>
