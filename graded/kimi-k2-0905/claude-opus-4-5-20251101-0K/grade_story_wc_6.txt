<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—firefighter muscle memory, the click of the coin against glass, the way kelp peace hums in her molars. The contradiction between “extinguish his legacy” and collecting heat-remembering sand is dramatized, not narrated. Final stance crystallizes when she pockets the jar: a micro-choice that visibly forecloses vengeance and endorses transformation. Earned cost is felt, though the father letter beat is summarized rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/texture lens holds: black sand, coin, obsidian, and cloud migration accrete until the final image reweights “fire” from wound to song. One legible shard-transition (lagoon → city apartment) is cued by “Tonight she would graft…” Closure is Charged Poise: the jar click reconfigures her options, cost legible in the warmth against her hip. No orientation debt; early anchors (radio silent, obsidian lagoon, cloud season) land by line 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian ribs, volcanic glass, kelp-drift peace—each sensory pick is filtered through Mara’s professional attention to heat and texture. The lagoon constrains her ritual: only here can sand remember fire without burning, forcing the choice to carry it away. Micro-setting (coin against jar glass, boots sinking) doubles as tactical interface. Final image of sand warming her hip fuses body-tool-environment, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—is signaled early and tightened when she pockets the jar, foreclosing the vengeance path. Escalation is accretive: each black grain adds moral weight until refusal to scatter it becomes costly. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and geological. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she walks away carrying the fire her father set.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fire: destroyer’s daughter becomes keeper of heat-without-flame. Subtext lives in gesture—coin clink, sand warmth—never in thesis statements. Final image answers the scar-song question non-literally: silence of migrating clouds, jar against hip, song as held frequency. Resists moralizing; ambiguity remains whether inheritance is truly rewritten or merely re-contained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual bias: heat, glass, dental hum. Syntax lengthens under kelp peace, shortens when “radio sat silent.” No dialogue, so voice distinctness assessed via interior diction—“volcanic glass pooled beneath the dunes like frozen midnight”—which is character-specific, not tour-guide. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“she realized”) they serve cadence, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high yet pattern-taught: every fire image is re-forged by lava → glass → sand progression, so no coherence break. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clauses drift like clouds, then tighten to “She climbed the dune.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds temperature or texture information. Final line cadence—“carrying darkness toward the light she would make from it”—lands without syntactic flourish, letting image propulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Premise—“firefighter daughter of arsonist”—is familiar, but synthesis with obsidian lagoon that grows succulents on stone feels fresh. Risk taken in accumulative structure pays off: geological memory becomes emotional organ. Transformation test passed: swap sand for ordinary beach and the entire metaphoric engine collapses. Deduction for near-echo of “scars can sing” which flirts with prompt echo; still, particulars outweigh template.</comment>
