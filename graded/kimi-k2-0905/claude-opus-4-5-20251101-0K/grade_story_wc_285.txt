<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coachman’s tactile superstition (needle in pocket, mother’s shroud-sewing backstory) gives him a believable interior life; the silent hand-off to the girl is a credible renunciation that costs him his talisman and lifelong ritual. Interiority is concrete—he “feels the gutters stop ticking” rather than labels emotion. The girl’s hollow eyes and ink-stained fingers are efficient embodiment; her decision to cross is the only consequential choice she makes, but it feels proportionate to her age and exhaustion. No relationship crucible (single passenger), so bullets not invoked; still, the dyad’s tacit pact lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the coachman gifts the needle, crystallizing a before/after in their unstated covenant; cost is the relinquished heirloom and the girl’s unknowable future risk. Causality is causal-lite but intact: gutters ceasing → final pull → dock emerges → transfer. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no disorientation. One continuous scene, single POV, one meaningful tightening (gutters silence) satisfies scope default. No lens ambiguity; drive is situational-pressure crystallized into emblematic act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fog, rope, gutter-drips, and lantern-glow are filtered through the coachman’s practiced senses; each sensory cue doubles as hazard gauge. Yarn needle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act—its transfer reweights the dock moment. Spatial choreography is flawless: ferry rope hand-over-hand, bench, satchel, lantern dimmed all track without drift. No anachronisms; Venn river and Thornmouth archives are named only as needed. Environment literally governs crossing safety, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the crossing remain lethal?”—is signaled early; gutters serve as live pressure gauge. One meaningful tightening (silence of gutters) reweights stakes and forecloses retreat; cost is the coachman’s surrender of protective talisman. Protagonist agency is attention-based endurance rather than active heroics, fitting situational lens. No external antagonist needed; river itself is pressure. Escalation is modest but proportionate to 700-word scale; price is legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of buried truth versus palimpsest emerges organically through coachman’s metaphor and girl’s archive quest; no overt thesis stated. Final image—needle passed into fog—reconfigures motif of mending across death and promises. Ambiguity lingers: we don’t know if archives will believe her, inviting reflection. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete objects and acts. Earned wisdom is quiet, tied to maternal craft and river lore.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside coachman’s perceptions; perceptual signature is auditory/tactile—“fog speaks,” gutters “tick,” rope creaks. Diction is weathered, coastal, preacher-spare: “wool-thick mist,” “hungry water.” Syntax lengthens slightly during meditative beats, shortens when he feels the gutters cease. No head-hop; girl’s interior accessed only via observable hollow eyes. Dialogue minimal but carries subtext: “I listen. I feel.” Voice cohesion survives gift moment without sentimental uplift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either sensory data or metaphor. High density: “lantern’s glow seemed to exist in its own small universe” does scene + mood + foreshadow in one stroke. Metaphors are coherent—fog as wool, water as hunger, needle as mend/curse—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates with crossing pace; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines are charged and specific. No filter-verb stacks; concrete nouns dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Palimpsest as literal archival forgery braided with metaphysical “old words bleeding through” feels fresh; ferry as liminal reading room is non-obvious synthesis. Yarn needle inherited from mother who sewed shrouds—turns domestic craft into death-river talisman. Coachman’s auditory navigation superstition is specific vocation lore, not generic ferryman. Risk stays conceptual rather than plot-twist, but coherence is high; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>
