<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Morrigan’s interiority is rich, her contradictory impulses (desire to reclaim lost time vs fear it is gone) are embodied in trembling lungs and burning climb; the moment she unfastens Iris’s cord knots up her love and cost in one gesture, earning her final restoration. Grandmother and Iris remain off-page, so relationship/status bullets do not apply; the solo POV is coherent and specific. The flaw of exhausted self-erasure is lived-in, not labeled, and drives every micro-choice until the card-door opens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the card-door swings, she drinks the firefly moments, and the cracked saucer glows—cost is the visible cord she forever surrenders. Causal linkage holds: because she climbs → finds glade → breathes on cards → unfastens lock → recovers time. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn descent) is legible; mosaic pattern taught early via card ritual. Accum/Textural lens holds; density tightens once when moments pour back into her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is not postcard but crucible: silver ladder burns her palms, ozone scents each breath, grass warms under palm-trace—details constrain every ritual move. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting; its fault-line mirrors her fracture and final glow recharges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: cards spread → saucer centered → cord unfastened → door opens. No anachronisms; world-rules (ink-cards respond to breath, glade stores time) taught through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost mother-time—is signaled in para 2; pressure tightens once when the card-door opens and she must choose to surrender the cord-lock. Agency drives escalation: her ritual tracing → warm earth → blank cards bloom → she decides to unfasten, paying the irreplaceable cord. Cost is visible: the leather falls away, foreclosing any future “seven knots” ritual with Iris. Under Accumulative lens, density of recovered moments reweights the stake; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: motherhood’s overflow of love coincides with erasure of memory; the glade doesn’t moralize but offers archaeology of tenderness. Subtext lives in objects: cracked saucer = hairline fracture between experience and recall; seven-knot cord = countable days she must now release. Final image of tracing Iris’s palms on everyday cloth answers the thematic question without stating it: presence must be re-performed, not hoarded. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the knowledge future moments will still slip.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited remains pinned to Morrigan’s perceptual signature: “lungs burning,” “jasmine and ozone and something older,” syntax lengthens then fragments as she weeps. No dialogue, so voice purity is judged on narrative texture: ink-in-veins metaphor recurs without churn, rhythm modulates from climbing cadence to hush of firefly dark. Free indirect style is clean: “She understood now…” stays within her lexicon. Compression (“three years of love restored”) is strategic, placed after sensory flood to maintain momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify (participial, nominal, fragment) without algorithmic feel. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mythic data. No mixed metaphors; “stars pressed close enough to wound” sustains physical logic. One scaffold spotted: “time sliding past her like she was made of glass” echoes earlier “moments slipping through fingers like water,” but the variance in vehicle (porcelain vs glass) is purposeful, not churn. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancer motherhood + cloud data-bank of squandered moments converts fantasy trope into maternal memory reclamation. Specificity anchors novelty—seven-knot cord, ink-stained veins, cracked doll saucer—so premise would collapse if elements swapped. Risk of sentimental “recover lost baby time” is subverted by demanding ritual cost (surrender the cord) and acknowledgment future forgetting will recur. Emotional truth feels lived rather than crafted for prompt; no close echoes to famous scenes.</comment>
