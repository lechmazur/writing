<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marguerite’s quiet vocation is vividly particularized—“gently thorough” is shown through decades of cataloguing grocery lists, not asserted. The moment she presses the locket to her lips and relinquishes it is a concrete micro-choice that carries ancestral weight and visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—she feels brass warm, tastes salt, never names her feelings. Flaw: final beat leans on the abstract phrase “weight of small moments” instead of a final bodily act, blunting the earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: handing over the locket crystallizes her new covenant with felt cost—she loses the last tangible face of her grandmother. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: every catalogued scrap → Keeper appears → covenant renews. Beat 1–4 teach pattern early; no orientation debt. One soft spot: “covenant regenerated around them like spring warmth” tells the change instead of dramatizing a visible shift; still, the locket transfer keeps the cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jetty at twilight is sketched with selective sensory economy—roses “catching the dying light like fragments of stained glass” fuses color, motion, POV bias. Micro-setting (locket brass warming against palm) functions as tactile anchor that charges the final image. Keeper’s plank-formed body supplies surreal specificity without over-description. Dock geography stays consistent; no spatial drift. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so capped at 7.6.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she renew the covenant?”—is signaled by paragraph 4 and tightens once: release the locket or keep it. Escalation is textural/accumulative; tension builds through pattern density (letters, roses, Keeper myth) rather than reversals. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the locket itself, paid on-page. Pressure stays coherent; no external antagonist needed. Missing a mid-course tactical narrowing, so stays sub-8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: small, forgotten lives are civilization’s ballast. Subtext lives in gesture—locket kissed then surrendered, not explained. Final image of her writing “one small truth at a time” reweights the opening cataloguing without moralizing. One soft echo: “through proximate causes” is repeated near end, lightly sermonizing; otherwise resonance is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marguerite’s archivist perception—attention to ink, faded ink, paper-settling sound. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, never drifts into committee voice. Occasional elevated diction (“steep the harbor,” “crystallized final moment”) fits the twilight mythic tone and is internally consistent. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry image + backstory + emotional tilt simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-repeat: “weight of small moments” appears twice—first as thematic seed, finally as abstraction; distance prevents 9+. Opening and closing lines are sharp, cadence varied. Grammar clean; pronoun tracks cleanly through Keeper encounter.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—town archive that metaphysically sustains civility via grocery lists—is fresh, non-obvious, yet emotionally credible. Mythic Keeper rising from jetty planks feels novel but grounded in prior letters. Transformation test fails minimally: core insight could transplant to another keeper-of-ephemera profession, but walnut-ink and locket particularize enough. Risk is moderate, not bold; no structural experimentation.</comment>
