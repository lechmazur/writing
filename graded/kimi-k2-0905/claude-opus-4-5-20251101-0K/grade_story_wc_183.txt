<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—longing to remember vs. fear of what that memory will cost—stay active in scene; the sister’s parallel desire to forget is shown, not told. Micro-choices (climbing the carousel, gripping mist-like hand, deciding to speak invented memories) are concrete and charged. The final renunciation of erasure is earned because every beat links back to the emerald cue and shared name. Only the grandmother’s “trembling fingers” label skirts diagnostic shorthand, but it is brief and offset by embodied action.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sisters choose remembrance, fog thins, sun breaks—on-page cost is the sister’s solidity nearly lost. Causal chain holds: emerald cue → poster recognition → carousel confrontation → invented narrative → corporeal return. One soft spot: the ship’s “gentle rocking” is declared but never shown affecting movement or balance, a micro teleport. Orientation is fixed by line 5; no debt. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tilted corridors, salt-stained mirrors, and skeleton poles are filtered through Maya’s urgency—she notices handholds, not every decay detail. Space and object states remain coherent; the emerald card drops once and is tracked to the final deck placement. Fog functions as both atmosphere and barrier—its thinning directly enables the sunlit re-materialization, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the card, carousel horse) constrains the exact moment of contact, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“recover or relinquish the forgotten name”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when sister confesses “I’ve been trying to forget,” converting search into rescue. One meaningful tightening: invented storytelling becomes the only tactic to solidify the sister; options narrow to speak or lose forever. Cost is legible (sister flickers, Maya risks re-forgetting), but the price feels more optical than visceral—no tangible resource lost. Agency remains causal and protagonist-driven under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as identity and forgetting as mercy; no character sermonizes. The green motif evolves from “eternal grass” to reclaimable life, reweighted when the card finally matches real daylight. Subtext carries in silence: the sister’s first line spoken “through water” implies years of muffled existence. Final image of card on deck avoids moral, yet reframes earlier decay as fertile ground for new memory—resonant without tidy message.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Maya’s metaphors skew aquatic (“drifted like a forgotten promise,” “spoken through water”), tying to bay setting. Compression (“blissfully aberrant joy”) is taught early and pays off when decayed horses watch the reunion. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under stress—sentence fragments appear only at flicker moment. Dialogue minimal but voice-differentiated: sister’s softer, fog-blurred cadence against Maya’s imperative pleas.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long languid clauses mimic fog drift, then staccato “Come back.” Information density high—one sentence can set atmosphere, reveal backstory, and foreshadow stakes. Only two minor loops: “memory without truth” echoes “truth without release” in adjacent beats; “rusted Ferris wheel” repeated descriptor. No mixed metaphors; diction stays within POV lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the green cue cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “abandoned memory carnival” trope is refreshed by anchoring it atop a drifting ship, then literalizing erasure as fog-bound disappearance. Invention lies in using narrative invention itself as the rescue tool—storytelling is not metaphor but mechanics. Specific detail (emerald swatch exactitude, salt-stained mirrors) prevents template feel. The transformation test fails if names or setting swapped: bay fog and ship decay are inseparable from memory erosion theme, proving genuine synthesis.</comment>
