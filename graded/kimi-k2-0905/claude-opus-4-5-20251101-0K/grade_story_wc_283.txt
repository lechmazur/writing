<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlowe’s interiority is evocative but drifts toward dramatized self-exposition (“She understood”). Buttons-as-memory is clever, yet the leap from “catalog lost buttons” to “cosmic instruction manual” is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her doubt or mis-sort. The inherited gift for “holding onto what mattered” is tell-stated moments before closure, softening the cost. Still, her quiet climb outward carries credible weight—an Earned Stasis that fits the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: prophecy flips to seed-manual, cost felt in “steady legs” carrying extinction-level stakes. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of buttons, amber, echoes tightens meaning until constellation pattern reconfigures world-rule. One causal micro-gap: why button constellation = usable map is asserted, not tested, but lyric mode tolerates the leap. Orientation crystal-clear by word 40; no temporal teleporting; single-scene default met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber warehouse is tactile—fossilized crates, stalactites of resin—each detail double-loads as time-capsule and memory-bank. Micro-setting (buttons, jar) literally constrain next moves: she cannot proceed until array is complete. Cliff-groans and filtered amber light charge the final climb-out image. Specificity never stalls momentum; every descriptor advances pattern-recognition or stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she harvest a usable map before forgetting wins?”—is signaled early. Escalation is density-driven: each button adds legible information, narrowing possibility space until constellation locks. No visible price (blood, time-limit) is extracted on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral—just sub-9. Protagonist agency pure: she chooses to keep climbing, foreclosing retreat to ignorance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “memory is fractal; scatter is preservation.” Buttons shift from detritus to star-map, enacting the idea without lecture. Final image of “possibility in a jar” offers resonant non-literal answer—no moral tagged. One near-trope: “world ends in forgetting” could slide into cliché, but warehouse’s amber archive particularizes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustained: diction (“crystallized resin,” “pattern prickled like chalk-dust”) is consistent, poetic yet precise. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for descent, clipped clauses for epiphanies—mirroring descent/ascent arc. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied in Marlowe’s shoulder-birthmark and fingertip sorting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid; figurative language dense but patterned (amber, fossil, constellation) so never muddled. One paraphrase loop: “She began cataloging…with methodical patience…By cataloging them…” −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening line (“had not heard a human voice…”) hooks voice and mystery instantly; final line (“Ready to become tomorrow”) lands clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic trope with antique button-collecting feels fresh and inevitable. Constellation pay-off re-weights every prior button without gimmick. Risk taken: no antagonist, no chase—entire plot is quiet sorting in dark, yet tension holds. Memory-as-star-chart offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis that would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
