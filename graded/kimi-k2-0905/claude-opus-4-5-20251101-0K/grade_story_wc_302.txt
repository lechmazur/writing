<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically sustained—gauze, watch, mist all filter perception—but the “I forgive you” beat arrives as abstract summary, not embodied micro-choice under pressure; the emotional cost is declared, not dramatized, flattening the final hierarchy of values. Motive trace is clear (mother’s sealed chain) yet the protagonist’s contradictory impulses (longing / dread) are told rather than enacted in the moment of discovery. Still, the voice stays singular and the flaw is local to the closure beat, so the character reads as a veiled dreamer rather than a theme puppet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the watch ticks forward, the library accepts her first spoken truth, path foreclosed to silence. Causal chain holds: watch → cipher → shelf → own blank book; propagation-delay rule is taught early and paid off. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“corridors of luminescent shelves”). One soft patch: the “seventeen years” wait is asserted, not dramatized, creating a mild ellipsis that the library immediately justifies; under the accumulative lens this is acceptable, but it keeps the piece from 8+ because the cost is felt conceptually rather than through a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library itself functions as micro-setting: glowing shelves, mist, frozen-tears binding—each detail constrains navigation and emotional access. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the watch’s ticking and the “frozen tears” tactility sharpen the final shelf. Spatial choreography stays clean: she “pauses,” “traces,” “lifts gauze”—no floating objects. The environment mirrors interior state without overt symbol-ing; the amber pulse is heartbeat-like because she feels it, not because the text labels it so.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find mother’s unspoken words—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each shelf color tightens emotional weight until crimson demands action. Agency is present (she traces, reads, speaks) but the decisive tightening—opening her own blank book—happens off-stage; we see the book already waiting rather than watching her confront the cost of filling it. Thus the price is legible but not viscerally paid in-scene, capping the score short of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as inheritance—emerges through catalog mechanics, not commentary. The blank book reweights the premise: unspoken words are not relics to collect but a legacy to continue. No moralizing final sentence; the last image (“path deeper into its heart”) invites continuation without forcing interpretation. Subtext operates in gesture (lifting gauze) and object (watch ticks forward) rather than explicit insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers just above the protagonist, sustained by fog, gauze, and cipher imagery; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon (“captured fog,” “champagne bubbles held beneath a cork”). Rhythm modulates: long vowel runs for awe, fragmentary clauses when she touches the frozen-tears spine. No head-hopping; focalization remains pinned to the Dreamer. The single POV and poetic compression meet the 9- gate; only the slightly expositional “now she understood” keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence variety is high; no template cadence. Information density strong—“propagation delays” is unpacked by immediate sensory consequence (light words arrive faster). Metaphors stay coherent: reversed watch ≈ reversed grief. One paraphrase loop: “reverse and restart” repeated three times in two sentences—acceptably pattern-teaching but still a trace artifact. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “library of unspoken words” could have been twee; here it is grounded in a mechanic (signal travel time) that literalizes emotional weight. Watch-as-cipher feels fresh, not gimmick, because it guides reading method rather than delivering a twist. Conceptual risk—grief as engineering problem—pays off in a final human utterance. Synthesis is specific enough that swapping any object would break the symbolic logic.</comment>
