<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mei’s grief is embodied in the folding ritual and the midnight climb; the lantern-capture choice grows credibly from craft obsession. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “grief cracked open like an egg, spilling not darkness but dawn” drifts into therapeutic epiphany rather than lived contradiction, blunting the earned edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: cranes → lantern design → basilica theft → midnight capture. The lantern’s activation beat delivers a decisive change with visible cost (Mei on knees, lantern glowing with “luminous torment”). One reflective block (Lin’s fall) is anchored to present paper cue and tilts the next choice; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Jasmine scent, floating terrace geography, and gem-polishing tools are filtered through Mei’s artisan eye and constrain her method. The lantern itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no world-rule contradictions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep Lin’s shadow from dissolving—is signaled early and tightens at the midnight clock. One meaningful escalation: the shadow arrives, Mei activates the lantern, options narrow from “let go” to “capture,” with the new cost of eternal lantern-glow. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation-through-craft emerges from the cranes-to-light progression; no final moralizing. The lantern image reweights earlier folding motif without explicit statement. Subtext in “the basilica dimmed slightly” acknowledges transgressive appropriation of elite tech, adding moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mei’s artisan perception; diction of polish, refraction, and paper grain feels specific. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences calm, then shorten at the capture. No head-hopping or register drift; “luminous torment” is the single allowed poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each crane fold, gem cut, or scent note advances grief or plan. One scaffold pair: “could almost hear her voice in the crystal’s resonance” immediately followed by the quoted “Mama” could compress, but clarity remains intact. No mixed metaphors or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami grief-work with stolen dream-recorder tech feels fresh; the “lantern as spirit vessel” twist grows organically from craft premise. Risk taken in merging spiritual cosmology and hard gem optics pays off. Slight deduction for echoing familiar “thousand cranes” trope, though retooled here.</comment>
