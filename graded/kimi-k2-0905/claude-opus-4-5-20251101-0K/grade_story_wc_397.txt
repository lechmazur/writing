<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s loosened grip on reality is embodied in her sensory drift and micro-choice to join the trawl; the parasol tip as tactile relic anchors her endurance. The interior contradiction—coming to die, choosing to drift—remains consistent and charged. Renunciation of the Zurich appointment is implied, cost felt in the final “waiting itself” image. Voice-specific perceptual warp keeps her individual, not diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each frozen detail layers patience until the final “fold between intentions” crystallizes the reconfiguration. The lacework tip’s return in the last paragraph reweights the premise without causal reversal. No orientation debt; place, time, and POV anchor within 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is the suspended future, felt in the body leaning into the marina’s groan.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting: moving dock, creak timbre, and cathedral ice constrain boat tactics and bodily stance. Cold-water trawling is tactile, tool-heavy, POV-filtered. The parasol tip substitutes for geographic breadth, its shadow a portable locale. Final image folds body, dock, and ice into one breathing system, charging the close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: learn to hear approaching endings while already under death sentence. Escalation is accretive—each ice crack deepens the patience fold rather than narrows causal options. The stroke’s perceptual shift is the irreversible price; no reversal is required. Final stance crystallizes when she leans into the groan, foreclosing the Zurich path without overt decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from relic survival vs. ice loss: beautiful pieces outlast wholes. No moralizing; the midnight sun image reconfigures prior death wish into suspended living. Subtext of “fold in patience” is enacted, not stated. Final resonance is quiet yet charged, inviting counter-readings of surrender or renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perception skew (“colors bleeding at their edges”) is POV-bound, not explanatory. Compressed lyric rhythm taught early and sustained; no filter-verb stacks. Captain Elise’s spoken line carries distinct maritime idiom, brief but audible. No head-hopping; voice stays inside Maren’s loosened sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting, character, and metaphor work (“the ice would shift when it shifted”). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated phrasing (“windborne solace”) fits lyric mode and is earned. Final paragraph breathes with short/long cadence match to dock motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “terminal patient in wild” trope and tilts it via post-stroke perceptual drift, making the Arctic a teacher of patience rather than mere backdrop. Parasol tip as relic object refreshes standard survival motif. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in closure. Synthesis feels specific to this voice; removing Svalbard or stroke would collapse the arc.</comment>
