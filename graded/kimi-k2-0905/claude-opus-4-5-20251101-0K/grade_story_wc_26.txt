<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—clinging to a physical stone while curating weightless hope—plays out in embodied beats (kneeling, placing the stone). Her “softly deliberate” stance is shown, not told, through the measured offer to the shadow. The ending’s Earned Stasis—accepting luminous regret as the price of guardianship—carries visible cost. Only minor hedge: the grandmother’s hand-off is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting the motivational lineage.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the shadow’s metamorphose from devourer to river-keeper reweights the entire premise, cost paid in the stone’s surrender. Causal chain holds throughout: comparison footage → confirms shadow’s autonomy → prompts offering → transforms threat into guardian. Orientation locked by line 10; no lens drift. Final image of darkness “flowing between preserved dreams” crystallizes options and stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The glass-and-light library is not backdrop; its hope-lattices and unfixed shadows actively constrain tactics—Vera can’t torch the shadow without incinerating dreams. Micro-setting triumph: the river stone’s grit against translucent petals offers tactile grounding that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is impeccable; we track her climb, kneel, placement, and retreat without drift. Meeting 9+ gate: the stone-as-body-proxy directly shapes the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve hope-shapes—tightens once: confirming the shadow’s independence collapses Vera’s prior tactic of mere cataloging, forcing material sacrifice. Escalation is accumulative: each dusk’s wandering darkness incrementally raises the stakes until the comparison footage crystallizes the threat. Cost is legible on-page: the stone’s loss and the enduring ache of “luminous regret.” Slight deduction: no secondary material loss (time, social credit) to vary pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief, if witnessed, transmutes into guardianship. The river stone’s shift from memento to offering reweights “preservation” from hoarding to release. Final image of shadow-as-river answers the thematic question—“how to remember a lost world?”—without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: Vera’s whisper “I notice you” is consent to shared custodianship, not conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“petals of translucent walls,” “hope-lattices”—is lyrical yet disciplined, avoiding purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for recognition (“I see you”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; succeeds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—shadow → water → guardian—without mixed logic. Information density high: one line can stage, evoke, and advance (“The shadow pooled beneath a lattice containing a child's hope, the simple wish to see an ocean”). Zero loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: data-cloud library + grief-as-autonomous-shadow + geologic memento is non-obvious and fully committed. Ascension Earth and shareable dreams are sketched, not explained, trusting reader. Risk—quiet, near-lyric resolution—pays off by making grief itself the curator. Could not swap stone or shadow without collapsing logic; concept is irreplaceable.</comment>
