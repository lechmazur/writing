<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-driven resolve and Petra’s brittle eagerness are crisply embodied; the ribbon hand-off crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior contradiction is light—Mira’s “laugh” arrives abruptly but doesn’t undercut the stakes. Relationship as crucible works: the climbing banter forces Mira to recommit to teaching under pressure. A hairline slip: Petra’s “fuzzy eye” complaint is diagnostic shorthand, but it’s brief enough to avoid full penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon transfer reweights the generational pact, cost is felt (“teach you instead”). Causal chain holds: breach → abandoned hall → letter → orchard → bag → recommit. Orientation anchored by word 40; no disorientation persists. Drive lens is Causal; because/therefore links tighten options until the final vow renewal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is vivid, selective, and physically coherent: roots in dust, fruit lanterns, sideways nest. Micro-setting (ribbon, quartz eye) constrains the final choice and charges the image. Sensory economy favors touch and sight filtered through climber urgency. No world-rule drift; spatial choreography tracks cleanly across beams.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the craft die?”—is signaled early and tightened when the bag’s contents foreclose that fear. One meaningful turn: the journal’s discovery shifts tactics from search to teaching. Cost is legible but generalized (lost guild, lost daughter); a sharper personal price would punch higher. Agency is Mira’s decision to hand over the ribbon, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from recurrent falling/returning imagery (deciduous vows, orchard litter, ribbon color shift). No overt thesis; final image of “spring always returned” reweights prior losses without moralizing. Subtext in ribbon color—“fog” versus former blue—carries unstated grief. Ambiguity lingers: craft may yet die, only the vow persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira’s quartz-eye whirr, climber-body filter, cathedral-as-vertical-garden idiom. Dialogue rhythm separates age: Petra’s clipped jabs versus Mira’s gruff tenderness. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Minor register drift—“conceptual integrity” in narration feels academic—but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong density: single sentences often do setting + emotion + metaphor (“apple trees rooted in centuries of accumulated dust and decay, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed like lanterns”). One paraphrase loop (“We persist… we keep coming back”) is intentional motif, not artifact. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. Final line cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guild-collapse eye-menders + cathedral orchard + deciduous vows feels inevitable in hindsight. Ribbon color shift reprises without gimmickry. Risky vertical setting is fully embodied, not postcard. Trope twist: generational knowledge hoarded by accident, not prophecy. Could not swap ribbon for locket without breaking resonance.</comment>
