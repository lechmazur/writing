<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—gift or curse—drives every micro-choice; her quiet articulation under threat of voice-loss embodies embodied emotion. The decisive turn (pressing the diamond to throat) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: language over safety. Earned stasis lands when she walks deeper into the canyon, copper threads now carrying the full lexicon at visible cost: the diamond has shattered, the birds have settled, her body alone must bear the resurrected tongue. No motivational slippage; every beat tightens the same stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (copper pulse, bird algorithm, echo tunnel) deepens the same existential stake—language death—until the final cadence shift reweights it to life. Closure is a Charged Poise: she stands in resonant silence, the cost (shattered diamond, embodied lexicon) legible without exposition. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“entrance to the towers of bone”); no disorientation. One minor causality fuzz: how the copper “intercepts” the curse is stated, not shown, but the image still lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, and flawed diamond are not backdrop but instruments: the towers’ shapes literally form the missing resonating chambers, the echoes preserve phonemes, the diamond becomes translator. Micro-setting (her copper veins) constrains the climax by rerouting the curse. Final image recharges earliest motif: she follows her own echo deeper in—setting now internalized. Specificity throughout (“grit in creases of old linen”) keeps description tethered to POV priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the dying tongue alive—tightens exactly once when she realizes birds encode phonemes; no reversal needed. Agency: she elects to press the cursed diamond to throat, trading silence risk for full lexicon; cost materializes as crystal shards and permanent bodily burden. Escalation is textural: each new sensory layer (copper hum, bird algorithm, echo multiplication) increases the weight of loss until the cadence flips to resurrection. Under Accumulative lens, density itself is the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language is a texture that must be lived in the body, not owned. Subtext sits in the flock’s silent flight—movement as alphabet, ownership as violation. Final image answers the stakes with conceptual re-pricing: resurrection is not triumph but ongoing burden (“true work lay ahead”). No moralizing; the cost is the commentary. The copper/diamond/bird triad never explained, only enacted, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to her perceptual filter: every noticed detail (sand in honey, wet wool weight) is texture-first, voice-second. Rhythm modulates from languid canyon observance to staccato bird formations under rising stakes, mirroring her pulse. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within plausible storyteller lexicon yet attains lyric lift. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “She raised the flawed diamond and studied the birds through its fractured heart” advances action, motif, and visual in one stroke). Metaphors stay coherent—copper as circuitry, birds as alphabet—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional beats; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only micro-slip: “quietly articulate voice” used twice; the repetition is distance-distant but not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—cursed diamond + copper vasculature + bird alphabet—feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk taken: language resurrection via avian choreography, yet the mechanics are taught early (echo tunnel) and paid off. Specific detail (“Tongue-Taker’s Flaw”) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the bone towers and canyon echoes are inseparable from the semantic problem. Fresh inflection at ending: resurrection framed as ongoing labor, not victory.</comment>
