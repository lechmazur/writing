<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—she “paints with light” to reclaim joy lost to commerce—and her embodied emotions (the fresco warming in her pocket, the involuntary laugh) anchor the arc. The contradiction between paid commercial work and this secret nocturnal art drives every micro-choice; each luminous stroke is a renunciation of corporate drudgery with felt cost (time, secrecy, spirit). Earned Stasis lands cleanly: she commits to return nightly, joy re-practiced, path foreclosed. Minor gap: we get no back-remembered instance of past corporate gigs to texture the wound, but the ache is still palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared early (“within the fold of a daydream”) and held: each sensory layer of fog, crumbling wall, and projected light thickens the stake of artistic reclamation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragment warms, fusing ancient pigment to modern beam—knowledge network whispers old techniques, options re-weighted. Closure is Charged Poise: perpetual mist will keep her secret, the glowing mural a private covenant. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—she chooses perpetual twilight labor over daylight success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-bound orchard functions as micro-setting that literally constrains tactics—sunlight denied makes “paints with light” necessary. Sensory hierarchy obeys artist POV: color ghosts of murals, temperature of fresco fragment, sound of her own surprise-laugh. Spatial choreography is immaculate—trees as “skeletal monuments,” distance tracked as she approaches her chosen wall. Final image of mist swallowing dawn recharges setting as sanctuary, not ruin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover joy in art—signaled in paragraph three and intensifies through each projected stroke; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when ancient fragment responds, forcing merger of eras and validating her covert method. Visible price: she will keep returning to night-fog, forfeiting daylight career. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word span; coincidence only as atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: joy is practice, not product. Recurrent image—laughing woman on fragment—shifts from nostalgic ache to catalytic mirror, charging final laugh. Subtext in gesture: pocket warmth equals permission, involuntary laugh equals proof. Avoids moralizing; the orchard remains ruined, her joy private, resonance bittersweet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric-omniscient stays consistent, focalization tight to Mira’s perceptual quirks—“light flowed…like exposed film.” Syntax lengthens during creation beats, contracts at the surprise laugh, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; neural-network whispers are still her filtered access. Diction remains painterly but avoids purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for fog layering, staccato “She laughed” for release. Metaphors stay coherent—film, orchard, beacon—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “She understood now that…” could trim, but it’s isolated. High information density; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, historical data without pad.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise mash—“daydreamable” ruined district, light-painting, neural archive—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of lost artist redeemed are subverted by keeping orchard ruined and joy clandestine. Specific detail (fresco warming, fog as sun-blocker) prevents template drift. Risk lies in quiet ending, but Charged Poise justifies it.</comment>
