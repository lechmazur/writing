<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to exile yet yearning for return—are dramatized in the tactile handling of logbook and oak grain; the final step through violet threshold is earned by seventeen years of micro-choices that cost her the safety of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The father’s off-page reawakening is felt as a visceral tremor in her body, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the prism terrace stops, the threshold opens, Wren steps through clutching the logbook—cost is the exile itself, now ended. Causal lens holds: because she deciphers the codes as prayers and accepts “necessary distances,” the drift halts and the architect’s search restarts. Orientation is taught early by disorienting refractions that payoff at the sacred edge. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bench’s oak grain, the violet threshold, and the prism’s light-lies function as micro-setting that constrain her interpretive choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is filtered through Wren’s architect-child eye—wood rings as braille, light as whisper—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: she moves from bench to edge in one continuous arc. Environment, body, and tool jointly shape the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she remain adrift or cross—tightens once she translates CAVOK as permission to land. Agency drives the turn: pressing the logbook to her chest, she speaks readiness, terrace stops. Cost is the seventeen-year exile itself, now paid to exit. No coincidence resolves; the father’s distant tremor complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of maze, flight codes, and sacred thresholds: exile as curriculum, distance as runway. The phrase “featherly determined” reweights from fragile label to earned engine of crossing. Final image reconfigures the maze from predator to teacher without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will reunion succeed?—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; refraction-whispers and wood-braille create a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the violet edge, longer reflective spirals earlier. No head-hopping; father’s tremor is inferred through Wren’s body. Register stays within Wren’s plausible lexicon of light and grain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “wood whispered of a forest near an airfield” does triple duty—setting, character, backstory. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned early (light-lies, fractured hush) and paid off at closure without muddle. Rhythm accelerates into the final three clauses, mirroring the stop of drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes labyrinth and aviation tropes into a fresh cosmology where weather abbreviations become prayers and corn-maze collapse births prism exile. The “featherly determined” coinage feels inevitable yet new, grounding transcendence in avian fragility. Risky lyric compression taught by line-one refractions pays off in sacred threshold without gimmick. Transformation test passed: swap any element and the whole shatters.</comment>
