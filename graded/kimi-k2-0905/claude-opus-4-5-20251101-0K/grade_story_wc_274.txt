<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete (“her hands trembling,” “chest ache”) and her contradictory stakes—mother in 1,203 vs. the discarded dead—are shown through micro-choice: six months clandestine repair, the single keystroke upload. The final line “She felt awake” is an earned epiphany, but the renunciation cost is stated more than embodied; we don’t see her brace for reprisal in body or plan, only assertion. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible and character-specific. Vance functions as secondary pressure, status shift cleanly staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: found letter → secret repair → upload → confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—“the data packet fragmenting… irreversible” and Vance’s painful grip—so price is on-page. Orientation is clean by sentence 4; timeline tension (“within the blink”) tightens options. One causality seam: Mira’s six-month off-stage repair is told, not shown, but it is motivated and does not break linkage. Closure effect reverberates outward, satisfying RR test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment and micro-setting (cryogenic interface terminal, snow-weighted skylight) constrain choice—cold keeps bodies viable, offline console gives secrecy. The “snow fell in sheets” returns in the last paragraph to re-weight silence into after-storm awakening, charging closure. Sensory economy is tight—breath visible, green blinking lights—filtered through archivist habit of noticing catalog numbers. Spatial choreography holds as Vance crosses from doorway to terminal. Setting passes 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose vs. protect mother—signals early; upload act deepens cost by foreclosing secrecy. Pressure tightens from silence of snow to live network hum; coincidence (Vance arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Price is legible: mother now hostage, Mira’s career/fate forfeited. Escalation is one decisive turn, sufficient for 600-word scope under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as complicity vs. voice as moral duty—emerges through image progression: adored silence → complicity → broken silence. Subtext lives in Vance’s neutral mask and grip. Final image of networks “carrying her dangerous gift” reweights earlier quiet without sermon. Ambiguity remains: is awakening worth blood price? Complexity acknowledged, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“cataloging the dead-but-dreaming,” numeric chamber labels—archivist-biased. Syntax breathes: long cold opening, then staccato “One keystroke… One more.” Dialogue sparse, indirection adequate: “Whatever you think you understand—” conveys threat without exposition. No head-hopping; Vance’s interior accessed only through external cues. Voice control strong but not quite virtuosic enough for 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density: “snow accumulated… pressing against her eardrums” does two jobs. No loops, no mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies: compound opening, then fragment “She felt awake.” Register stays within POV lexicon. Minor hedge: “dangerous liaison letter” feels slightly canned; could compress to “incriminating letter” without loss. Otherwise line-craft publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen-mind archive + whistle-blower arc is familiar; freshness comes from claustrophobic single-night, single-keystroke climax and mother-in-stasis personal stake. Specific detail—chamber numbers, Transparency Riots—grounds premise. Risk-taking modest: structure default, no formal experiment. Synthesis competent rather than revelatory.</comment>
