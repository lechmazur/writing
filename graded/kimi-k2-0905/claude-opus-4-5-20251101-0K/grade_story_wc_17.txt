<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s perceptual gift is dramatized in the first beat—palpating stone for “echo fossils”—and every later choice (abandoning sensors, pocketing Helena’s negative, pressing the wall again) flows from that trait. Interiority stays concrete and biased; the impulse to “give walls voice” is tested against the discovery that they already possess one, producing a micro-cost in humility rather than a declarative epiphany. The only cap is slight: no interior contradiction shown at the climax; she simply receives the legacy. Still, the lens is Accumulative and the stance crystallizes, satisfying the 9- gate. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the final sentence—“they dreamed of exactly this moment”—reprices the entire premise, making the walls’ consciousness undeniable and charging Mira’s future labor with conceptual cost. The Accumulative lens is taught by the repeating gesture (hand on stone) and holds to the last line; orientation is anchored by word 80 (“ivy-veiled passage”). One meaningful tightening occurs when she swaps live mapping for salvaged diaries, narrowing her agency from explorer to inheritor. No causal break; cost is legible in the weight she now shoulders. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy tunnel functions as micro-setting: it screens light, hides artifacts, and literally guides her fingers to the wall; its rustle supplies the final auditory layer. Sensory economy is biased to touch and hearing, matching an echo-cartographer’s priorities. Spatial choreography is clean—entry, fireplace crouch, pack closure—no impossible positions. Setting charges the final image: filtered light on the negative strip reframes the corridor as witness, not ruin. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira hear the walls dream?—is signaled in paragraph three. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each salvaged object (diary, negative, sensor cascade) deepens the acoustic archive rather than threatening life, narrowing her option from discovery to custodianship. Cost is conceptual but felt: she must “continue the cartography” forever, inheritance as tether. No overt antagonist or reversal, fitting Accumulative design; one meaningful deepening suffices. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as reciprocal listening—emerges through repeating gestures, not assertion. The negative strip reappears as mirror, reframing Mira’s solitude as continuity, not sequel. Final line avoids moral; it crystallizes the walls’ desire to be understood, reweighting prior ivy, ash, and echo as sentient archive. Ambiguity lingers: who is servant, wall or woman? </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Mira’s synesthetic bias—stone hums, light is “filtered,” diaries “curl.” No head-hopping. Syntax is rhythmic but controlled: longer sentences for archive awe, fragments for tactile beats (“She extracted them carefully”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Compression in the last paragraph is purposeful, mirroring sensor cascade. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers sensory or historical information without scaffold. Metaphors are few and coherent—“echoes nested like fossils”—never overwritten. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly; final sentence propels outward, not explanatory. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—walls as dreaming witnesses—takes standard haunted-architecture trope but re-casts it as climate-gothic inheritance. Helena’s diaries and embedded filaments feel engineered, not magical, and the profession “corridor echo cartographer” is freshly specific. Accumulative closure rather than ghostly reveal avoids cliché. Risk in quiet ending pays off: conceptual cost > spectacle. </comment>
