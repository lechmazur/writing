<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor’s armor-as-skepticism is vivid; the seashell tug and cello-induced collapse are embodied. The shift from myth-buster to listener lands with cost—she descends changed, shell to ear, recorder forgone. One interior contradiction beats: “This is acoustics” while grief floods—enough for this length. Flaw: the father line arrives late, so the cost feels slightly imported rather than compounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses pure debunking, keeps the shell, chooses wonder with a visible forfeiture of certainty; lens holds Accumulative/Textural—density of voices reweights her stance. Causality inside the cello beat is soft (why unfinished cello works is elided), but pattern is taught early and closure coherent. Spatial anchors (cliff, dome, stairs) clear by 100 words—no orientation debt. One micro-turn: bow drawn ⇒ voices dissolve armor; suffices for 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Observatory as cracked cranium mirrors Eleanor’s fracture; every tactile detail (rust, November chill, bow vibration) feeds the stake. The half-finished cello becomes micro-setting that constrains the impossible music, charging closure. Selective senses—sound foremost—keep economy tight. Only nit: “perpetual gray sky” edges toward weather cliché, but dome wound redeems it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she heed living words?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is single deep dive: cello voices force a stance shift; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: surrender of epistemic control, on-page laughter/weeping. Lacks persistent external consequence (she’ll come back tomorrow), so ceiling high-7s not 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“listen before words die”—emerges through cello retell, never sermonizes. Subtext in shell’s compass-shift and her laugh-cry crystallizes without label. Final image of shell-to-ear re-weights earlier dismissal of grandmother. Ambiguity remains: is it physics or miracle? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains crisp perceptual filter: “her boots echoing against rust and silence.” Syntax lengthens under grief, contracts under denial—rhythm mirrors pressure. Figurative language stays within POV lexicon; no head-hop. Distinctive phrasings (“abandoned observatory…forgotten thought”) seed voice early and repay at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences pull double duty (sensorial + emotional). No loops or scaffold; metaphors consistent. One mixed vehicle: “observatory held her grief like cupped hands” after dome-as-skull is minor. Density high; read-aloud rhythm varies. Closure line clean, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Myth-buster meets talking cello” is fresh, but core trope—skeptic confronted by living memory—familiar. Specifics redeem: unfinished cello as resonator, painted compass-shell that warms, grandmother idiom. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk level moderate; concept commits without gimmick.</comment>
