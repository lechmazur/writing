<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-scarred patience is credibly embodied in the brass-and-bone ritual and the smile at the ice-groan; the final “learned to give” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the brother’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the contradiction that forged her. Still, every micro-choice on the platform is filtered through that back-story pressure, so motivation tracks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed maps foreclose her exile and crystallize the coming blindness of the Empire. Causal chain—measurements → storm → unyoking—is legible and goal-driven; the viaduct amplification is set up and paid off. One soft spot: the “three-month” storm timing is told, not shown, slightly blunting cost immediacy, but the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt ribs, ice mirror, brass-and-bone instruments—each tactile detail is filtered through Mira’s cartographer gaze and constrains her slow movements. The frozen lake doubles as clock and mirror, charging the final smile. Micro-setting (platform rail, frost on lenses) alters calibration choices; no spatial drift. One tiny lapse: “crystal along its iron rails” appears after the viaduct is already discovered, but the image is quickly anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—timing the storm to enable mass unyoking—is signaled early and tightens when the viaduct amplifies readings. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the ice-groan smile: she accepts that erosion beats assault. Cost is conceptual—decades of isolation compressed into one final dataset—but felt on page via “she would leave when spring came,” foreclosing any return to anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of geologic patience emerges through recurring ice / stone / moon imagery rather than statement; the final “even frozen things remembered how to flow” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext of renunciation is carried in the quiet packing of instruments. No motif is forced; each recurrence (ice groan, basalt ribs) alters Mira’s stance. Could use one more counter-thread to reach 9-band complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mira’s perceptual filter—brass chill, star-scatter on ice—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her ritual rhythm; diction (“plumed white,” “unyoke”) feels idiosyncratic yet grounded. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. One clause drifts toward editorial—“the revolution asked only for patience”—but immediately re-grounds in her footstep.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: each sentence layers sensory data with emotional calculus. Metaphors (leviathan ribs, suspended river) are coherent and brief; no mixed chains. One scaffold echo—“patient revolution” repeated twice in closing paragraph—dims momentum slightly. Otherwise rhythm modulates, paragraphs vary, and no filter-verb clusters appear under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Blending geophysics with insurgent cartography feels fresh; the magnetic viaduct as natural amplifier is a specific, non-obvious invention. The “erosion over explosion” insurgency refrains from worn guerrilla tropes. While frozen-lake revolutions echo some cli-fi, the moon-path cryptography and brass-and-bone tools particularize this iteration. Risk is present but not flashy; specificity, not gimmick, drives originality.</comment>
