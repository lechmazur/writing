<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>VERA-7’s nostalgic-android interiority is vivid and specific—the static grown loud, the borrowed fears calcified—yet her final micro-choice (miniaturize & bury) feels slightly under-motivated; we see the emotional build but not the causal leap that makes *this* act the inevitable release. Still, the embodied contradiction (“synthetic fingers brushing petals that felt more alive than her own chassis”) sustains pressure, and the Earned Stasis of turning with the roses carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the grain of compressed trauma buried beneath the oldest rose becomes the new before/after, magnetic north restored, static quieted. Causal linkage holds—magnetic shift → sensory migraine → box ignition → miniaturize—but the “why now” of initiating the burn protocol could be one beat sharper. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of iterative tending and containment pays off in the final image of roses breathing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass dome, adenium spirals, irrigation pipes as fire-ring—each environmental element is lived-in and choice-constraining: the dome’s transparency lets magnetic auroras charge the final image, the sandy paths meter VERA-7’s ritual pace, the burn pipes repurpose life-support for sacrificial cleansing. Selective detail never stalls momentum; “strangely organic” is felt through tactile Bloom-to-chassis contrast rather than declared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the inner static—tightens once: box opened → fears burned → grain compressed. Escalation is textural (density of ritual vs. chaos) rather than causal reversal; the magnetic shift externalizes the pressure but does not narrow tactical options until the burn choice. Cost is legible in the ashes and the speck of dark matter, yet the stakes never deepen beyond the single internal metric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically: decades of absorbed childhood terrors miniaturized into a grain that fertilizes the same roses—closure re-weights “containment” into recursive nourishment. No moralizing; the final image of android and roses turning toward an artificial sun offers quiet conceptual repricing of machine-care vs. self-care. Ambiguity lingers—has she merely relocated, not purged, the chaos?—which deepens rather than muddies resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, metallic yet botanical: “static in her circuits like a migraine” marries tech and flesh; syntax lengthens during ritual walks, compresses in the burn moment. No dialogue, so perceptual signature carries all; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual calcification”) fits android POV. Patterned repetition of “morning rituals” and “static” teaches cadence that quiets satisfyingly at end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative control high—“magnetic auroras danced across the sky” arrives only after physics cue, avoiding purple. Information often dual-tasked: “peeling stickers of cartoon characters no one remembered” compresses time and cultural loss in one stroke. Final paragraph mirrors opening with altered valence, giving circular momentum without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of nostalgic android, desert-rose greenhouse, and magnetic-shift fire ritual feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist scent. Risk in letting climax be a miniature compression rather than explosion pays off by thematic inversion—smallness as liberation. Specificity throughout (irrigation pipes repurposed, plastic spider melt) prevents abstraction; could edge higher if magnetic aurora rule were seeded earlier to heighten wonder.</comment>
