<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s fear-to-ice reflex is vividly embodied and contradictory impulses (serve the tea vs. flee) collide in scene. Interiority stays concrete—flashback to cellar crow-count anchors present micro-choice to inhale instead of panic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: ritual precision > safety > self-exposure. Final stance crystallizes when she traces the rune on her own transforming skin—cost is the scar now iridescent, path foreclosed: she can no longer hide the mark or the ice. Missing the 9-band because the mentor’s absence is off-page; no second character to pressure/status-test her, so relationship crucible and status shift are N/A—cap not violated, yet the solo ritual keeps the arc inward and safe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore links—memory triggers frost → breath held → tea traced → frost sheds → scar remade. Orientation anchors within 120 words: floating rock, amber twilight, solitary apprentice. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scar’s iridescence re-weights her premise from curse to alphabet. Cost is legible in the lightning-branch now publicly legible—she forecloses anonymity. Slight drag: the “tomorrow she would return” future-tell edges toward summarised aftermath; cost is felt but not yet socially paid, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Body-as-setting functions: forearm scar becomes parchment; quill and kettle are tactile tools that constrain gesture. Weather and rock motion are filtered through her narrowed storm-trauma perception—steam scent, rain curtain, dry pocket at centre. Spatial choreography is clean: kettle, cups, quill, crows circle; no impossible moves. Final image of iridescent scar on living flesh charges closure. Environment does not merely mirror mood—it is the page she must write on. Micro-setting qualifies and reweights choice; just shy of 9 because description occasionally luxuriates until the rune-drawing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she master the ice or be mastered—signalled at “tried to remember how to breathe.” Escalation is micro but causal: each flare of frost forces a tighter stillness, narrowing options to inscribe or shatter. Agency is decision to write on living skin—cost is physical (cold crackle) and social (scar now legible). Persistent constraint (ice) shapes ritual tactics; no coincidence resolves. Missing a sharper external consequence within the scene keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific inversion: childhood superstition (counting crows) becomes adult methodology for linguistic self-authorship. No moral delivered—image of scar-as-alphabet lets reader feel the cost of turning trauma into text. Subtext in silence of crows at end: they watch but do not speak, implying stories yet unwritten. Epiphany is earned through physical ordeal, not assertion. Metaphor of “breath between storms” reweights from meteorological pause to existential workspace—no thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical close-distance stays inside Mira’s perceptual filter: selective crow-count, scent of char, geometry of scar. Syntax lengthens during calms, fragments under frost flare—rhythmic modulation matches breath control. No dialogue to judge; narrator diction within apprentice lexicon. Filter verbs (“she saw”) appear only when perception itself is the stakes. Voice is consistent, textured, and distinct to her storm-scarred worldview.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per high-pressure beat, no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm varies: opening lyrical cadence, clipped fragments during frost surge. Information dense: steam curl recalls scar shape; tea colour mirrors storm light. No synonym loops or scaffold. Minor over-adjectiving in “spilled ink” robe image keeps it from 9.0, but artifact does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar magic-school trope is re-angled through embodied rune-scarification and folk-nonsense epistemology. Real innovation: body becomes parchment, childhood superstition becomes translation software for trauma. Specificity of lightning-fractal iridescence is fresh; generic “scholar” label is only token. Risk taken with quiet, lyric closure—pays off in Charged Poise. Not quite 9 because core “orphan with elemental curse” scaffold is recognisable despite surface renovation.</comment>
