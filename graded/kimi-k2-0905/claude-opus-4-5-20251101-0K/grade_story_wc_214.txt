<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her aching joints, the ritual ladder climb, the palm on cold rail—but her motives stay static; she begins and ends in the same stance of chosen solitude, so no new contradiction or higher-stakes choice is forced. The “cosmic janitor” persona is vivid, yet the text labels her spiritual growth rather than dramatizing a fresh test of it; the final smile feels like confirmation, not costly renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stardust sweep and amber-glass observation layers density until the dawn image reweights “stillness” as active survival. Closure is a Charged Poise: the captured sunrise in yellow glass crystallizes her lifelong bargain—lonely vigil for cosmic intimacy— with undeniable conceptual cost; the station “waits for a world that had forgotten how to look up” foregrounds the price of her endurance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory stones, moss-choked scopes, and the yellow lantern glass are tactile, lived-in, and fate-bearing; the amber lens literally refracts both starlight and meaning, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—ladder, railing, dome slit— and the environment’s decay constrains her mobility and options, anchoring the stakes of staying.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain vs. leave— is signaled early; pressure deepens through accreted solitude and bodily wear, but no new external complication arrives tonight. The single meaningful tightening is dawn’s approach: daylight forces her to withdraw, underscoring that her vigil is cyclically finite; cost is felt in aching joints and the world’s indifference, yet the beat is familiar, not revelatory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: abandonment reframed as chosen stillness, death as arrival. The amber glass’s transformation of “falling” into “blooming” supplies a visual thesis without abstract sermon. Final image of the lantern holding a “small captured sun” reconfigures prior motifs—stardust, sweeping, solitude—into a resonant, non-moralizing answer about endurance as quiet rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s synesthetic perception—”honeyed, alive”—and controls psychic distance; syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses at dawn. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent cosmic loneliness. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never drifts above her self-taught star-reader register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) flirts with loftiness but stays anchored in sensory payoff. No scaffold or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with celestial sweep vs. joint ache. Final line cadence earns its quiet uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor conceit freshens the abandoned-observer trope; yellow-glass reframing of meteor death as bloom is a specific, non-obvious twist. Still, the arc of solitary watcher finding meaning in smallness is familiar; risk is emotional rather than structural. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically new.</comment>
