<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—she measures with “careful precision,” speaks aloud to her dead father, and the trembling heart under steady hands shows embodied contradiction. The flaw-to-golden-seam arc is credibly powered by fifteen off-page years, but the on-page micro-choices are few: only the decision to use the coin and the final walk-out carry visible cost. The shift from crushing shame to open-carry legacy is legible, yet the story tells us “she understood” twice rather than dramatizing the exact instant the weight flips. Still, the kintsugi metaphor shapes her worldview distinctively and the endurance leaves a felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the metal’s “imperfect sheen” reweights the father’s name from poison to golden seam—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the cracks remain). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: rain, furnace glow, and coin rub layer density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words), but the single-scene default is stretched by a fifteen-year ellipses that is told, not shown; because the lens is accumulative this does not break causality, yet it slightly weakens the tightening moment. No meaningful escalation inside the scene—pressure is atmospheric, not tactical—so the beat qualifies as one deepening rather than a reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Foundry, rain, soot-stained bench, and furnace glow are selectively filtered through Mira’s healer-alchemist eye; tools are handled (crucible, coin, satchel) and constrain action. The rain stops at dawn, mirroring the internal wash but avoiding overt symbolism because it is tied to the furnace’s cooling timeline. Spatial choreography is clean: lantern retreat, work-bench layout, coin pressed into warm metal. The zodiac coin serves as micro-setting that charges the final image—its Scorpio imprint literalizes the “golden seam” in the new alloy—meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: redeem father’s name without erasing imperfection. The only tightening comes when she embeds the coin—an irreversible act that forecloses alternative alloys—but this is a single, quiet choice rather than a rising sequence. No external antagonist or time-clock beyond the implied dawn; pressure is atmospheric (rain, furnace heat, village memory) rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual—accepting visible cracks—so the escalation is legible under Accumulative lens yet modest in scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “redemption through embracing fault lines.” No explicit thesis statements; the kintsugi idea is shown via alloy that keeps its cracks. Final image of “seam of gold running through everything she would ever create” offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, invites counter-readings (is she still trapped by legacy?). The village’s absent voices remain unforgiven, preserving moral complexity.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is lyrical but anchored in alchemical diction—“tincture,” “crucible,” “transcendent”—with syntax that mirrors heating/cooling rhythm (long reflective sentences, then short declarative beats). No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional elevated phrasing (“captured tears,” “celestial scorpion”) borders on poetic overwrite but stays consistent with her factually-mystical vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense—three metaphors in four lines at climax—but the pattern is taught early (“lanterns… like scattered stars”) and pays off in the final alloy image, so the density feels purposeful rather than accidental scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “weight of his name shifted… no longer purely leaden” restates the prior sentence’s idea; minor −0.2. No tense or pronoun drift; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi alchemy is fresh angle on familiar “redeem family shame” arc; the coin-as-catalyst and cracked-beautiful metal are specific to this voice. Risk-taking is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than dramatic confrontation—but coherence is high. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test passes—swap alchemy for pottery and the emotional logic collapses. Minor proximity to Murakami-esque rain-and-lonely-workshop vibe, but detail set is distinctively metallurgic.</comment>
