<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—fleeing versus embracing fragmentation—are dramatized in her tactile handling of the tarot-mirror debris; the moment she layers transparency over opacity crystallizes her prior flaws and costs her the old commercial identity. Interiority stays concrete: “her mirrors had become enemies” fuses psyche and craft. The final stance (painting multiplicity) is earned by the sequence of micro-choices with the silk thread and the collage act; cost is felt in the lighthouse’s amber grief and her shaking hands. No diagnostic self-labeling; voice remains idiosyncratic and embodied throughout.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism-portrait refracts rather than unifies, reweighting her entire artistic rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she abandons the lucrative single-image market. Accumulative lens holds: salt-light, contracting walls, and layered fragments intensify pattern until the cadence shifts at “prism” declaration. Orientation anchored by word 86 (“Eleanor climbed its spiral staircase anyway”). Persistent constraint—walls that literally tighten—shapes her tactical turn to collage; cost is legible in the final lantern flare that accepts incompleteness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-library hybrid is not backdrop but hydraulic chamber: breathing walls constrict choice, the salt-crusted windows color the amber grief light that charges the final image. Micro-settings—broken tarot box turned frame, mirror shard reflecting text—are handled in goal-directed action and constrain her redesign tactic. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral ascent, third-landing table, walls measurable by inch. No brand lists; sensory hierarchy favors tactile dust, green lace hinges, silk thread under fingernails. Environment literally presses inward to force the artistic break.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—artistic identity versus marketable unity—tightens when every failed portrait costs clientele; the lighthouse’s contracting walls externalize that pressure. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes fragmentation is ontology, not failure, forecloses the path of “fixing” faces and narrows options to prism-making. Escalation is accumulative: dust motes → salt light → walls inching inward → lantern flare; each layer ups the cost of clinging to singular likeness. Visible price paid: she forfeits her portfolio of commercial “failures” and embraces an aesthetics of multiplicity with no patrons waiting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular sequence of mirror-shard overlays rather than assertion: portraits as prisms refract human multiplicity, not fix it. Subtext resides in silence—no patron voices, only rhetorical questions to the breathing tower—inviting reader reflection on their own fractured selves. Final image of a face that “shifted depending on the angle” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question. No sermonizing; the tarot card, photograph, and mirror shard accumulate meaning through reuse, not symbol grafted late.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Eleanor’s perceptual quirks: noticing dust motes as “passengers on a sinking vessel,” feeling walls “closer now than when she’d entered.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into short questions that mime her broken sight. No head-hopping; psychic distance choreographed—intimate for finger-thread, middle-distance for lantern memory. Rhetorical questions read as self-conversation, not reader nudge; diction stays within her artistic lexicon (“transparency over opacity”). Voice modulation matches pressure: clauses shorten when walls contract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, no template cadence; only two instances of “she” opener in sequence, justified by urgent action. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work: “Dust motes swirled through beams of fractured light that fell through salt-crusted windows, illuminating shelves that curved with the tower’s wall.” Metaphors stay coherent (salt-lace hinges, nervous-system silk) and physically grounded. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold hedges. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not moral. Copy clean—no typos, tense drift, or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—artist’s block cured by mystical space—is transformed through the lighthouse-library as a literal hydraulic chamber that breathes, making fragmentation architectural rather than therapeutic. Specificity: tarot cards shuffled with book pages and mirror shards creates a material logic unique to this tower. Fresh inflection: the prism-portrait refracts instead of unifies, offering a non-redemptive resolution. Synthesis feels inevitable—every salt-crusted detail primes the final optics metaphor. Risk (breathing building) heightens stakes without gimmick; closure remains legible.</comment>
