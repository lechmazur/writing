<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vera’s curiosity is repeatedly asserted (“persistently curious by nature”) yet never dramatized in contradiction or costly choice; she listens and translates without visible risk or personal stake. Margaret’s guilt and need are clear, but the sisters’ interior contradictions remain off-stage—Ruth is only a pulse, Margaret only apology. The micro-choice to “translate” carries no escalating cost, so the arc lands as facilitation rather than transformation. The emotional change is Margaret’s; Vera’s curiosity neither complicates nor forecloses her own path.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a credible Earned Stasis: Ruth’s pulse quiets after Margaret’s confession, peace achieved with felt cost (decades of insomnia). Causality is light but coherent under an Accumulative lens—each pulse-strengthening moment follows Margaret’s revealed truth. Orientation anchors within 120 words; single-scene default met. The lens holds, yet the decisive change is Margaret’s, not Vera’s, so the protagonist’s causal footprint remains thin.</comment>

<comment>The atrium’s sanatorium history, fog, and marble are filtered through Vera’s tracer gaze, supplying atmospheric density without checklist excess. The hearing aid functions as micro-setting; its static and pulse constrain the only available action (listening) and charge the final silence. Spatial choreography is clean across the wheelchair move and photo release. Environment does not alter tactics beyond the initial premise, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Margaret’s need for absolution—is signaled early and tightens as each confession strengthens the pulse. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens: every new detail heightens the spectral response until silence equals resolution. Vera’s agency is purely facilitative; no option narrows for her, so cost is vicarious rather than personal. A visible price is paid (photo released, pulse gone), meeting the low-bar for 8+ but not charging Vera’s own path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: lingering grief can be metabolized only when the living speak the unspeakable. The hearing-aid pulse and photograph act as concrete particulars, not abstract symbols. Subtext resides in the static-to-silence shift rather than any stated moral. Final image reweights the premise—listening is the last mercy—but the slight soft-focus on “vulnerable voices” keeps it just shy of 8.8+ resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent, slightly vaulted register (“mist-clad atrium,” “membrane between worlds”) appropriate to the premise. Syntax flexes with emotional temperature—short clauses under pulse-listening, longer cadence during confession. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Vera’s perception. Distinctiveness is moderate; the cadence occasionally drifts toward template lyricism, capping entry below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold; information density is high with simultaneous scene-work and world-texture. Metaphors (“fog pooled like spilled milk”) are apt and non-competing. One paraphrase loop—“pulse—irregular, hesitant, but present”—is minor. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final line lands with crisp image. Minor filter-verb clustering in early expository lines holds score just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh conceptual twist that obeys internal logic without late rule-breaks. The haunted hearing-aid device and pulse-mapping method are specific, non-generic. Emotional core—sister estrangement healed post-mortem—is familiar, but the spectral tech angle re-inflects it. Risk is moderate; premise feels inevitable yet not radically transformative, keeping score solidly mid-8 range.</comment>
