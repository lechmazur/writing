<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to an obsolete craft while adapting to silence—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of outward sound is earned by the tactile trial-and-error that precedes it. Embodied emotion (“hands ached with the silence”) is specific, never diagnostic. The hedgehog’s presence supplies external pressure without diluting focus. Only the grandmother backstory is told, not tested, keeping her just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new bone-conducted music reconfigures community possibility while the silence persists—cost is the permanent privatization of sound. Causal chain (porcelain → crack-reading → inward instrument) holds without gaps; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 40. One reflective block stays under 20 % and tilts present action. No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once when cracks become channels, not endings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The porcelain insulator and stress-cracked sculpture function as micro-settings that literally channel vibration; their material properties constrain design choices and charge the final image. Alder grove is filtered through a wood-worker’s priorities—grain, cambium, sap—rather than scenic catalog. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over audition, mirroring the premise. Spatial choreography is clean in the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore music—faces the irreversible silence; pressure escalates when outward attempts fail and inward transmission becomes the last open path. One meaningful tightening: cracks shift from damage-data to essential circuitry, foreclosing conventional resonance. Cost is legible: music is now confined to bone and soil, never again to travel free air. Agency resides entirely in Maren’s iterative carving and final strum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through material metaphor: trauma (cracks) becomes conduit, empathy becomes literal vibration shared root-to-root. No character verbalizes the thesis; the hedgehog’s curled/uncurled mirror supplies silent counterpoint. Final image reweights earlier porcelain telegraph as ancestor to the new tactile network. Ambiguity remains—will communal silence fracture or deepen—yet emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual signature: wood grain, fracture patterns, vibration felt in marrow. Syntax lengthens and compresses with musical phrasing, supporting the symphonic mind. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Register stays within artisanal lexicon; no corporate or academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“music bloomed inside her bones”). Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; no filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic. One minor scaffold—“silence had come…silence remained”—is purposeful echo, not redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the familiar “last musician in a silent world” by rejecting airborne sound entirely; bone-conduction via stress-cracked wood is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable once taught. Risk—no audible music on page—pays off by making reader complicit in haptic imagination. Specificity of porcelain telegraph insulator and alder cambium prevents generic substitution. Conceptual integrity holds: silence stays absolute, victory is redefined, not revoked.</comment>
