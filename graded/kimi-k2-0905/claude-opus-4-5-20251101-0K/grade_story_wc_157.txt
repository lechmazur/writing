<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus’s rogue-scholar charisma and curiosity are vividly present, but Sofia remains largely functional—her interiority is sketched only to facilitate exposition. Their shared decision to plant is credible, yet the emotional cost is collective rather than individually textured. The earned stasis (they commit to a long game whose price is deferred) is consistent with the premise but feels slightly safe; a sharper personal stake would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: taxed thoughts → gourd-seed dead-drop → decoded garden plot → joint resolve. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair crystallize a covert future whose social cost is legible (“thoughts would be free again” vs. Bureau surveillance). Time remains free is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics; the notebook choreography page supplies the visible price. All orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse micro-setting is textured through sweating glass, atlas-moth wings, clicking mandibles—details that constrain secrecy (humid silence) and supply the literal seed. Spatial choreography is tight: Marcus palms the seed, Sofia steps between rows, lamp draws the moth. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus’s scholar-rogue bias: he notices architecture of enclosures, beetles as “conspirators.” The setting never stalls action; every detail is woven through gesture or dialogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade thought tax & reclaim free expression—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when they decide to plant encoded gardens. Agency is shared: Sofia’s prior garden network becomes tactical infrastructure; Marcus supplies code. Cost is conceptual (future risk of discovery) rather than immediate; a sharper micro-loss (tool, social credit) would have lifted this into the 9-band. Still, the tightening forecloses passive resistance and commits them to active subversion.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as contraband, cultivation as resistance. The gourd rattle’s shift from curiosity to punctuation mark reweights the motif without overt statement. Final image—vegetable choreography spelling messages visible from drone-height—offers a resonant non-literal answer: free thought will grow literally underground. No late moralizing; the Bureau’s taxed dreams line supplies conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice carries scholar-rogue perceptual signature: “charming smile that had talked him out of three expulsions,” “angles & escape routes.” Syntax modulates—compressed when surveillance is near, expansive when describing insect choruses. Free indirect clean: “Time is the one thing they haven’t figured out how to tax yet.” Dialogue indirection is present (“Show me the alphabet”) but limited; more subtext would have nudged higher. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “glass walls that sweated with humidity and terrariums housing beetles from six continents” loads scene, humidity, global scope in one sweep. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (moths as conspirators, gardens as virus of hope). Rhythm varies: long breathy sentence for greenhouse intro, staccato exchange when stakes are voiced. Final line cadence mirrors planting patience without drum-beat monotony. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: taxable thoughts + vegetable cipher + gourd-rattle punctuation feels inevitable in hindsight yet unseen elsewhere. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—beetle chorus, greenhouse humidity, and garden-code specificity root the piece. Risk in adopting horticultural steganography is fully committed to; no retreat into safer tech MacGuffins. Specific detail (“consonants were carrots and vowels were climbing beans”) keeps concept alive rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Setup: “too charming for his own good” line 1. Development: uses charm to recruit Sofia, calculates angles/escape routes. Closure: his scholar-rogue trait seeds the alphabet lesson, locking him into future risk. Cost is conceptual (surveillance exposure) rather than tangible, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Seed handled in opening beat, re-appears as planted promise in closure. Irreplaceable: only gourd rattle’s audible shake works as untaxed punctuation. Causes Sofia’s final request (“Show me the alphabet”), directly shaping ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Concept taught early via notebook, constrains middle choice (they decide to plant code), reweights closure (gardens will bloom rebellion). Mechanics visible: carrot consonants, bean vowels. Without it, no tactical path exists.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.6</question><comment>Marcus labels himself “candidly cryptic”; trait enables his half-explanations that lure Sofia without triggering Bureau flags. No deeper cost shown, so stays mid-band. Swappable adjective would dull voice but not break plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>“Warp reality” is metaphorical—he aims to bend surveillance perception, not physics. Serves as motivational flare rather than concrete action; decision to plant gardens is the actual warp. Metaphor’s poetic utility keeps it above 6.0, but lacks tangible tactical twist.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Method seeded in paragraph 9, developed via notebook diagrams, payoff in final planting vow. Sofia’s two-year garden network is the infrastructure that makes revolt possible; without this exact method, the climax collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Greenhouse supplies humid silence that protects against neural monitors and provides literal seed. Spatial choreography keeps pair hidden among rows; setting shapes secrecy protocol. Could swap for another hothouse, but insect chorus and glass sweat are texturally specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Taxed-thoughts premise opens story and tightens every silence. Timeframe creates immediate stakes but no ticking clock within scene; pressure is ambient rather than urgent. Still, all tactical choices derive from this fiscal surveillance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>“Stand guard over our own spark” is quoted motive, dramatized when they accept risk of planting coded gardens. Conflict between safety and expression is on-page; cost is deferred but legible. Slightly abstract; a sharper immediate sacrifice would lift higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Chaos (insect clatter, converging wings) starts atmospheric and modulates into strategic disorder of city-wide garden patterns. Tone charges final image: rebellion likened to virus of hope. Coherent escalation from micro-chaos to macro-insurrection.</comment>
