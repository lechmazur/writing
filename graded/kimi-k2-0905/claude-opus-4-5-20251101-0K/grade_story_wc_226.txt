<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s contradictory impulses—obedient daughter vs. memory-guardian—are dramatized in the final cascade of seven truths; the paint-stained fingers and canyon-echo tests show embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“thought of her mother’s hands…”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to speak many truths is earned by childhood mischief and clandestine rehearsals; the price (ritual failure, Elders’ wrath) is legible. Cap at 8.7 because the external consequence is implied, not yet paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bone tower now holds a “spectrum of humanity,” reweighting the ritual’s rule-set with undeniable social cost—Elders’ authority dissolved in their own canyon. Causal chain holds: childhood acoustics → refract plan → dawn execution → tower hums. Orientation anchored by word 30; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the moment the spire “hummed” and Elders’ commands became indistinguishable poetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon’s echo physics is not backdrop; it enables the entire refract tactic and charges the final image. Bone towers constrain movement and supply the carved surface that absorbs the multi-truth. Mist thickness modulates auditory surveillance, directly shaping the poets’ positioning. Environment, body (paint-stained fingers), and tool (tower as resonator) together constrain the climax—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve maternal complexity—tightens when dawn light breaks and Sera must choose single vs. refracted truth. One meaningful escalation: the poets’ hidden rehearsals convert ambient acoustics into tactical advantage, narrowing Elders’ options to silence. Cost is visible: ritual authority nullified, Sera exposed to unspecified reprisal. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refracted truths themselves: “forgiveness is not forgetting.” Subtext lives in canyon echoes that turn sanctioned monologue into polyphony. Final image reweights the premise—memory can be plural without moral collapse. No final-paragraph sermon; the hummed tower is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Sera; perceptual signature filters through artistic metaphors (“paint-stained fingers,” “light through glass”). Rhythm modulates from ritual cadence to cascading anaphora (“She stole bread…”) under peak pressure. No head-hopping; Elders’ voices remain external, indistinct—intentionally dissolved. Diction stays within Sera’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long breathless anaphoric runs to fragmentary whispers; no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned early (“light through glass”) and paid off at climax. Zero paraphrase loops; each refract line adds new facet. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone-canyon memory-prison is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail and acoustic physics. The refract tactic weaponizes echo as plot engine—risky structural choice that pays off. Familiar “erase the sinful past” trope is inverted: multiplicity defeats erasure. Specificity of seven bread-lines makes the abstract device concrete and memorable.</comment>
