<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to recover extinct names—remains vivid and embodied; the cracked bamboo tube as proxy for her daughter’s lost syllables externalizes the ache. Interiority is concrete (“shape of it in her mouth…spring rain and copper pennies”) and her gently systematic ritual gives consistent micro-choice. Emotional arc moves from solitary tending to tearful, earned release, but no second character or status shift means no crucible test; the cost is felt yet internal, not relational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design taught early: orchid-name library, extinct feelings, spiral corridors. Escalation arrives via the echo of the lullaby gathering extinct phonemes; closure lands when the bamboo reseals and orchids bloom with recovered names—visible, sonic, charged. Causality is metaphorical but coherent under the lens of resonance; rhythm of listing extinct emotions builds density that the final cadence releases. No orientation issues; time/space anchors float but are legible by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal walls, cloud-level library, foxglove regret, calcified hope—these particulars are sensory, selective, and filter through Mira’s caretaker eye. Micro-setting (bamboo tube, orchids) constrains the ritual and literally hosts the closure image; no white-room lapses. Weather and spatial choreography stay consistent; world rule (names fossilize into orchids) is shown, never exposited. The setting’s emotional palette directly powers the thematic engine rather than acting as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost names—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the fracture widens daily. Agency appears through the ritual of echo-singing; the escalating beat is the bamboo drinking in resonance until it sings back. Cost is aesthetic and emotional: Mira’s tears, the reopened wound of remembrance, and the knowledge preservation can only be partial. No external antagonist; pressure is temporal/spiritual, perfectly sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as fragile, communal archive—emerges from the orchid conceit and extinct-feelings museum, never sermonized. Subtextual hinge: the library collects not just names but obsolete griefs; lullaby as carrier wave lets private love become public resonance. Final image of rainbowed sound refracted through opal offers Conceptual Repricing: what was lost is now both audible and visible, altering value of forgetting. Ambiguity lingers—names will go extinct again—resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, syntactically varied—“sugar in time’s indifferent waters”—and remains inside Mira’s lexicon and perceptual bias. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Pattern-taught metaphor chain (foxglove, calcified hope, copper pennies) pays off in final orchid bloom. Psychic distance tightens under ritual precision then widens into wonder; compression during climax (“impossibly, beautifully”) matches emotional surge. Distinct perceptual signature achieved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences layer image upon image without template cadence. High information density: each clause layers sensory or emotional data—no filler. Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors—and supports rather than obscures causality. Minor scaffold: “quietly poisonous to those who linger too long” echoes standard regret trope, but it’s brief and functional; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library-of-extinct-feelings and orchid-name vessels feel fresh yet inevitable; emotional specificity prevents gimmickry. Lullaby-as-sonic-torch transforms familiar trope of memory-song into literal resurrection of dead phonemes, satisfying transformation test. Risk taken with lyric accumulation pays off in resonant final image. Conceptual integrity complete—no retreat into metaphorical safety.</comment>
