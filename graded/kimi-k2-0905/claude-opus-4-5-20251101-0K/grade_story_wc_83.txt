<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yara’s survivor-incompleteness is rendered through body-level memory (breath fogging the port, copper taste) and micro-choices—resetting breakers, recording coordinates with trembling fingers—so motive stays visible in action. The geode’s shift from “intangibly tangible” to “impossibly, unbearably real” crystallizes her earned stance: she forecloses the option of forgetting by choosing to keep hunting. One interior contradiction pulses throughout—her drive to prove deaths were not inevitable while admitting resurrection is impossible—keeping her from tidy sainthood. Cost is legible in the final image: she returns to equations knowing the answer may never come, the geode now a weight she refuses to set down.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the spike on the readout reconfigures meaning—her map of unspent futures is growing, the price being perpetual pursuit. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds; each cooling cycle and failed overload is a because/therefore stitch pressuring her to keep computing. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The only drag is a 23-word reflective block (lines 29-32) that summarises therapist language already shown through embodied memory; it does not break escalation but does keep the score shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory constrains every move: breakers trip because wind tilts the station; clouds resemble “brain tissue contemplating nothing,” mirroring her obsessive hunt; console beeps are tied to literal countdown. The geode functions as micro-setting—its purple scatter on the walls marks time passing and reappears in the final image, charging the closing beat. Sensory economy is ruthless: taste of ash, ears ringing, cold viewport—all selected to keep the lens on bodily aftermath rather than panoramic spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that massacre was not universe-mandated—signalled in paragraph five and tightened when the new spike forces her to keep mapping at personal cost (no rescue, no end). One meaningful deepening: the third pocket’s pattern now “she was beginning to understand,” narrowing option from random grief to chosen obsession. Agency is her finger on the record button; renunciation is accepting perpetual hunt. Cost is the lived circuit of isolation, described as “bleak exhilaration,” felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: unresolved quantum pockets = unlived futures of the dead. No explicit thesis; the geode’s final glow reweights earlier “hollow beauty” line, implying unused potential can still birth painful beauty. Ambiguity is preserved—her map may be futile—yet emotional after-effect is unmistakable: reader left holding the same heavy stone. Final paragraph avoids moralising; instead it equates “unused potential” with “not wasted hope,” a resonant repricing that lands as image, not lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Yara’s sensory filter: “tasting copper and ash,” “watching her breath fog.” Diction is controlled—no academic jargon beyond “perturbation theory,” which she literally uses. Rhythm accelerates into short beats during console beeps, then exhales into longer lyric sentences on clouds; the modulation mirrors her pulse. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; internal voice remains coherent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “circuit breakers had tripped again, overloaded by her latest calculations” does triple duty (tech state, causality, time pressure). Metaphors are spare and coherent: clouds as “brain tissue contemplating nothing” sustains the observatory-as-mind frame without mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Only minor scaffold: two adjectives (“intangibly tangible”) could be one, but the oxymoron is voice-true and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of quantum-waste cosmology with survivor grief feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior story has treated “unused potential” as both physics and epitaph. The geode-as-hope-in-hollowness is a specific, non-transferable image; swap it and the thematic engine collapses. Risky choice to keep protagonist alone, narrating equations, pays off by making the observatory itself the antagonist circuit. Synthesis rewards rereading: first sentence’s “clouds that had long forgotten the earth” prefigures the ending’s denial of closure.</comment>
