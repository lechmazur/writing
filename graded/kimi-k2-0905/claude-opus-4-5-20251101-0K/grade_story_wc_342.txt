<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her tactile perception of faces as “landscapes of texture” is specific and embodied. The contradiction between her blindness to faces and her sought-after art is dramatized through her hands-on discovery of the coin’s coordinates, a micro-choice that tilts her stance. Yet the arc is more accumulative than causal: she “understands” rather than decides, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. The Earned Stasis rings true, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the condemned oak “finally released” reweights the scholars’ failure as liberation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via nested hollows, carved constellations, and the tactile coin—until the cadence shift at dawn. Causality is present but soft: the coin’s indentations lead her to the book, yet the manuscript’s insight is received, not wrenched. Cost is felt in the “heightened stillness” awaiting demolition, a Charged Poise that forecloses preservation and licenses new sight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is not backdrop but instrument: its false panel, carved star-slits, and heartwood chambers constrain how Elara searches and what she can carry out. The coin’s microscopic grooves act as micro-setting, dictating finger movement and narrative direction. Spatial choreography is flawless—every tactile discovery is tracked in real time. The final image of the oak “settling into its final hours” charges the atmosphere with undeniable mortality, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving vs. releasing knowledge—tightens when the manuscript asserts that limits are doorways, forcing Elara to re-price her lifelong blindness. No external antagonist is needed; the demolition clock supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each carved surface or coin ridge adds density until the stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual but legible: she leaves the tree to its destruction, carrying the “heartbeat” of constraint in her palm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: failure to mirror heaven becomes the very doorway to transcendence. The scholars’ theorem and Elara’s art converge on the same insight—limits are not prisons but invitations—without abstractions being imposed. The final image of the oak awaiting erasure reconfigures the premise: knowledge survives by relinquishing containment. No moralizing; the resonance is left humming in the reader’s hand like the coin’s indentations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: every visual noun is routed through touch—“hollowed trunk,” “grain of centuries-old wood,” “copper worn smooth.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with Elara’s finger pace, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; focalization stays tactile and consistent. The elevated register—“fractally precise patterns,” “microscopic geography of corroded metal”—is justified by the scholar-built world and pays off in the final conceptual reweighting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence openings vary from participial to noun-driven, avoiding template cadence. Metaphors are tactile, never mixed: “landscapes of texture,” “constellations filtered through calculated starlight.” Information density is high—one sentence often layers time, texture, and thematic hint. A single paraphrase loop—“the tree stood condemned, its rings of knowledge awaiting erasure”—is forgivable at closure and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portraitist who maps infinity through touch is a fresh synthesis of synesthesia and archive apocalypse. The scholars’ carved star-chambers inside a living oak feel inevitable yet wholly new. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure, and it pays off when the failure of mirroring becomes the liberation. The premise could not survive a simple swap of venue or profession; the tactile logic is irreplaceable.</comment>
