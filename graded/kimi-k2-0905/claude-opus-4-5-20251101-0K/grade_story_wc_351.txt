<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s helical, "chaotically precise" mind is shown in concrete micro-gestures (angled mirror, exact equipment placement) and contradictory interiority—engineer’s logic colliding with mystical hunger. The memories she absorbs are dramatized, not labeled, and each wave visibly taxes her body (tears, trembling), creating escalating cost. Her final refusal to distinguish “her” longing from the acquired ones is an earned renunciation that forecloses return to ordinary identity. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; perceptual signature stays consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure intensifies through density of orphaned memories rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 60; spatial logic holds. Closure is a Charged Poise: Vera crystallizes into a lifelong "keeper" of abandoned dreams, cost felt in the image of moon-set mirror still gleaming—an open-ended stasis that reweights all prior strata. No meaningful escalation flaw; accumulation peaks exactly at the final sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon layers, broken mirror fractures, and moonlight refractions are returned as tactile constraints: the mirror’s angle must stay exact or the channel collapses, and the mineral walls literally hold the archives she raids. Sensory hierarchy is engineer-visual—angles, strata, reflection—yet body-led (trembling, weeping) under memory load. Final image of sourceless mirror-light recharges every earlier glitter, locking setting as the closure device. Environmental specificity is irreplaceable: remove the canyon’s mineral memory and the entire premise collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve erased dreams—signaled in paragraph four and complicated by each influx that threatens self-boundaries. Escalation is accretive: every absorbed life tightens the psychic noose until "she could no longer distinguish" becomes the irreversible cost. No coincidence; pressure is purely internal-accumulative. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the returning image of broken reflectors (mirror, mineral flakes, moon splits) that reweight the premise: wholeness is a lie, fracture is preservation. No moralizing; final line invites extrapolation without spelling it. Subtext of gendered erasure (stonecutter’s cathedral, burned prodigy) is felt, not stated. Emotional aftereffect lingers as bittersweet solidarity with lost futurity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric-elevated register stays anchored in engineer lexicon ("synaptic modulator," "interference patterns") creating a hybrid science-mystic texture that feels intentional. Sentence rhythm spirals—long cumulative clauses that mirror helical thought—then snaps short at peak memory influx, taught early and paid off. No head-hop; single POV remains locked to Vera’s body. Filter verbs are minimal and justified by perceptual distance needed for techné description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High metaphor density is patterned and accretive, not ornamental—each light/reflection metaphor feeds the final mirror-gleam image. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop ("abandoned dreams... dreams that had been abandoned") but it occurs in low-pressure exposition and does not touch closure. Otherwise clean, vivid, information-dense lines that advance atmosphere or character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neuro-engineering + geologic memory archive yields a conceptually original hauntology. Broken periscope as sideways-viewer into dead minds is non-obvious and becomes inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure in under 800 words—pays off with clear closure. Specificity of erased historical voices (1647 math proofs, Victorian manuscript) resists generic "lost souls" trope.</comment>
