<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid (“brightened disquiet”), her micro-choice to carve the cameo blank crystallizes the arc, and the retroactive self-curatorship gives her a concrete, costly identity shift. Emotional embodiment is strong; only minor gap is that the early “bewildered” label isn’t tested in an observable mistake before comprehension arrives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mosaic shard structure (journal-portal → orchard → bathroom → grove) is taught by 25 %, transitions are legible, and the ending lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: Maren realizes she must perpetuate the loop. Causality is nonlinear yet coherent; the bathroom beat satisfyingly pays off the tile clue with felt cost—“she left changed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silver blossoms rising, membrane sky, and cameo-as-map are selective, sense-layered details that double as choice constraints. The impossible bathroom anchors bodily need inside cosmic scale, charging the final image; only missing micro-setting constraint in the closing grove prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—inherit the forbidden knowledge—tightens once in the marble bathroom when comprehension forecloses the option to refuse. Escalation is accumulative: each odd structure (tea-steaming kitchen, future nursery) deepens density until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible: eternal curatorship with no exit page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy as self-authorship across time. The blank cameo’s shift from emptiness to living map reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of “bewildered but purposefully so” offers resonant, non-literal answer to inheritance question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“silver blossoms drifted upward instead of down”) is character-bound and rhythmic. No head-hop; purposeful compression (“between the first and last page”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; strong verbs (“carved,” “humming”) propel. One paraphrase loop (“bewildered still but purposefully so”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Nonlinear self-inheritance via astral orchard is fresh; bathroom as transcendence chamber flips trope usefully. Concept commits fully—no retreat to linear time—and the risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
