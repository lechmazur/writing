<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and grief are concrete; the moment he spots his self-serving wish to resurrect Grandmother, contradictory impulses collide on the page and the choice to renounce that hope costs him something palpable. Interiority stays sensory (“wilting” chest) rather than diagnostic. The micro-choice to apologise to the chip crystallises values under pressure, earning the lighter-than-years beat at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chip’s light is not restored to Elias’s past but dispersed into future songs—cost is the vanishing stone and his acceptance of mortality. Causal chain holds: dishonesty detected → music stops → confession → transmutation. Orientation is swift; “tonight, the chamber felt different” anchors time and place by line 3. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights all prior mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The resonance chamber’s copper walls, amber pulse, and transformed rust are not backdrop; they modulate the only two actions Elias can take (play or stop). The micro-setting of the workbench arranges the seven boxes in a fixed geometry that must be obeyed for the ritual. Sensory selection skews auditory and tactile, matching a tuner’s ear. Final sparkle of “copper stars” recharges the opening covenant of rust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light before midnight claims it forever”—is signaled early and tightens when each night the chip dims. Mid-story reversal: the music itself halts because Elias’s hidden wish introduces a moral impurity, forcing either abandon or honest surrender. Escalation is causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each added box increases harmonic density until the dishonesty pattern breaks. Cost is the stone’s erasure and the irreversibility of death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the transmutation of rust and dishonesty into forward-shining song; no character sermonises. The covenant of rust reweights from decay to dignified sparkle without verbal gloss. Final image of “reclaimed dawn” inside humble boxes offers a non-literal answer to grief: memory survives by dispersal, not resurrection. Ambiguity remains—readers may see alchemy as mercy or consolation—but the emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s tuner-brain: harmonic vocabulary, mechanical metaphors for emotion, no knowledge beyond the bench. Rhythm swells and thins with the music; short sentences under the “wilting” beat mimic skipped gears. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through syntax and sensory filter. Compression (“tinkersong wonder”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical: “copper walls singing sympathetic harmonics” fuses setting and action in one clause. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic field. One mixed risk—“covenant of rust” personification—earns its keep by returning as transformed literal glitter. Final paragraph varies cadence to echo a music-box fade-out.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing alchemical philosopher’s stone with a music-box repair shop feels inevitable here, not gimmicky: both traffic in miniature precision and latent song. The “covenant of rust” reframes entropy as negotiated rather than defeated, a fresh angle on both grief narratives and alchemy tales. Risk of sentimentality is skirted by dispersing the miracle into seven anonymous future gifts. Specificity of tuner’s craft keeps the magic grounded.</comment>
