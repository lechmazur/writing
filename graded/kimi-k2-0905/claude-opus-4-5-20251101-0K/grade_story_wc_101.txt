<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her grandmother’s coat pocket, the bell’s map of hands—yet the moment she hands the bell to Yusuf crystallizes her hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradiction between safety and heritage is dramatized, not declared. Yusuf’s skepticism supplies external pressure that forces her to articulate the cost of memory aloud, earning the final pocketing of the photograph. One hairline slip: “survival meant more than food” flirts with label-speak, but is immediately embodied by the bread-and-tea communion scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens: the photograph tucked beside the bell reweights the entire pattern of anonymous gifts, making the exile’s return legible as future possibility with present cost. The because/therefore linkage holds—anonymous crates → nightly runs → bell ritual → photograph promise—without causal gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”) and again at the patrol-avoiding culverts, satisfying the 120-word test. One minor scaffold: “This was the architecture of survival” summarizes what the scene has already shown, but it occurs mid-text and does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor’s clay pillars constrain every gathering; their salt-weathered surface mirrors the community’s erosion. The silver bell’s micro-setting—tarnished map of every palm—functions as portable homeland, charging the final pocket image. Spatial choreography is clean: volunteers arrive “in twos and threes,” crates descend from a borrowed truck, distances tracked through back paths and culverts. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s urgency—moonlight first, then rationed candlelight, finally the dawn glow on columns—never a tourist catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep a scattered people whole—tightens when anonymous crates remove scarcity as excuse, forcing Mira to convert food into ritual instead of mere relief. The midnight run itself is the single meaningful escalation: each silent step amplifies the risk of patrols, narrowing options to memory or oblivion. Cost is visible in Yusuf’s glare and the grandmother’s flour-short lesson, but the patrol threat stays atmospheric rather than concrete; a missed opportunity to show one confiscated parcel or imposed curfew fine. Still, the escalation coheres under Accumulative pressure and forecloses the path back to nameless survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bell’s inherited sound and the photograph’s mute promise: memory is portable only if carried at personal risk. No character articulates the thesis; instead, the final envelope reconfigures “anonymous” from safety to complicity in return. Subtext resides in Yusuf’s silence after he weighs the bell—he hears the old sound before he believes it. The story resists tidy morals by leaving the benefactor invisible, forcing the reader to price that anonymity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s sensory filter: “salt winds that came too hot and stayed too long” is perception, not meteorology. Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, then fragments during the run—“They arrived in twos and threes”—matching breathless tempo. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong (“rang,” “unloaded,” “tucked”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Yusuf’s clipped suspicion versus Mira’s ancestral cadences. The final sentence’s quiet parallelism (“until the sanctions lifted, until the borders opened…”) feels earned ritual rather than drumbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs—”The bell had crossed borders in her grandmother's coat pocket, smuggled past checkpoints, carried through refugee camps” delivers heritage, danger, and tactile object in twenty words. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new axis of risk. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moon hung silver, columns glow amber—never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by image that recharges bell + photograph without exposition. Micro-scaffold only in “This was the architecture of survival,” but its summary is brief and mid-text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar deportation/refugee terrain is refreshed by making the supply chain mysteriously bidirectional—anonymous donor inside the homeland shipping aid outward. The bell-as-memory-device and photograph-as-return-ticket invert usual exile tropes: the past is carried forward, the future ships back. Specific detail—“terra-cotta” not concrete, “ridge” not camp—roots the concept in one ridge rather than every border. Risk is moderate; the inversion feels inevitable only after the final envelope, not beforehand, keeping it from the top band.</comment>
