<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessional curiosity is more than backstory: it drives every beat—tracing hopscotch numbers, cross-referencing the cipher, choosing to stay up alone—and the final grin is a credible renunciation of rescue fear. Interiority stays concrete (“hands shaking,” “laughing aloud”) without label-speak. No contradictory impulse is staged in a single scene, so the 9+ quick test barely fails, but the endurance cost is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → Luminance) triggers the next action under her agency. Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration—her notes reweight the ship’s purpose—cost is the sleepless night and future debt to proof. Minor waiver: the “someone once believed” backstory is 21 % of word-count, but it tilts her present choice and is repaid at climax, so BRR passes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Airship brass, shifting starling shadows, and the moth-eaten rug are tactile, bias-filtered through map-apprentice eyes. The hopscotch board acts as micro-setting that literally constrains foot and eye movements, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy narrows to lantern-light dust grooves under urgency; no postcard catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn abandonment into discovery—signals early and tightens once when she realizes the final coordinate is directly below. The night-long observation is the meaningful escalation; options narrow from passive waiting to active documentation with visible fatigue cost. Coincidence (birds point, Luminance appears) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: solitude can be alchemy—abandonment transmutes into agency through patient attention. No explicit thesis, only the reweighted image of starlings roosting “as if they belonged.” Subtext of playroom vs. explorer charts layers innocence and ambition without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-limited voice stays inside Elara’s map-idiom: “coastlines and trade winds,” “ghosts of numbers.” Rhythm accelerates with parataxis when light blooms—“She scrambled for her instruments, hands shaking”—then exhales at dawn. No head-hop, no register drift; perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long breathless accumulations to fragment bursts under pressure; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is spare—only two metaphors across climax—hence no muddle. Opening and final lines re-echo “starlings” and “notes,” creating clean ring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher is a fresh, organic conceit that fuses child’s play with celestial navigation; trope transformation succeeds. Risk in choosing a quiet, solitary climax is rewarded by Conceptual Repricing rather than spectacle. Without the exact starling-Luminance linkage the finale collapses, so irreplaceability is high.</comment>
