<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s quiet, ritualized competence is vivid; her refusal of digital tools and the wax seal embody her creed. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final “cost” is the perpetual return to dawn vigil—an earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the mail-slot swallow reweights the entire premise—slow magic beats instant tech, and Vera’s life is foreclosed to repetition. Causal chain (chalk → transcription → letter → future escape) is airtight; 37-day clock is a persistent constraint. No orientation debt; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first image to final amber line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden arcade’s marble, fountain, and brass fixtures act as tactile filter for Vera’s attention; the ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting that literally bears prior handlers’ wear. Dawn light shift from “first light” to “cathedral of amber” reweights the stakes at closure. Environment never merely decorates—it dictates slowness and visibility of chalk codes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the message out before caretakers erase the chalk—tightens once: yellow-over-blue = imminent. Escalation is textural: dawn brightens, ads flicker, child with chalk approaches, time narrows. Cost is the eternal return implied; no visible price beyond that, so stops short of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: history survives in margins, slow artifacts outrun progress. Subtext lives in the children’s ignorant artistry and the wax relic—never named as “resistance,” only enacted. Final image of tomorrow’s chalk reconfigures the arcade as living palimpsest. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Vera’s shoulder, perceptual signature filtered through patina, brass, ink scent. Syntax lengthens during transcription, shortens at mail-slot—rhythmic mimicry of task. No head-hop; diction stays within her antiquarian lexicon. Voice is unmistakably hers: “small poems, identities that contained multitudes.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid cadence to clipped final drop; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is selective—amber cathedral, veins of mail—never overwrought. Information dual-loads: “ebony clipboard pressed against her chest” conveys object, emotion, and ritual in one touch. Clean copy, zero artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cyber-escape trope with steampunk tempo inversion; chalk-code via toddlers feels newly mythic. Risk: entire plot hinges on deliberate anachronism, yet world logic stays internally rigorous. Specificity of 37-day surface orbit makes the concept un-swap-outable. Freshness survives transformation test.</comment>
