<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Corin’s “lukewarm” self-concept is embodied in trembling hands and tepid-robe color; his refusal to quit is shown through spider-silk instruments, not told. Interior contradiction arrives when he admits his devotion is “brittle” yet keeps pouring understanding into cracks. Final bell-whisper earns stasis: he smiles while the viaduct stays indifferent, foreclosing greatness but accepting possibility—cost is the lifetime of mockery he wears. No secondary character on page, so status crucible not tested; micro-choices (measuring fractures, warming bell) reveal value hierarchy clearly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single drop of sound re-weights cosmic drip rules, felt cost is the lifetime marginalization crystallized in “lukewarm” label now vindicated. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence-density → hairline mapping → drip-cadence shift. Causality intact—bell warmth arises from prolonged handling, not miracle. Orientation anchored by word 60 (viaduct, dawn, Corin center); no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: crystalline arches supply reflective surface that scatters dawn light into “blue fire,” guiding Corin’s ritual timing. Spatial choreography clean—bell tracked from trembling hands to warming bronze to first whisper. Sensory hierarchy obeys mage’s attention: color first, then temperature, finally sound. Environment does not merely mirror mood; its indifference pressures him to accept modest success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart cosmic flow—signaled paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: silence honey-thick → hairline mapping → drip begins → new current forms; each stage densifies failure cost. Agency visible in micro-choices (silk instruments, pour understanding). No reversal, but deepening reweights stakes from “fix universe” to “enable one drop,” price is public mediocrity affirmed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via drip metaphor: value of modest, persistent acts vs heroic miracles. Subtext in bell’s voice existing “somewhere” reframes failure as hidden persistence. Final image re-prices “lukewarm” from insult to sufficient condition. Avoids moralizing; instead shows possibility born of limitation. No motif echoing for checklist sake—drip returns because it’s the causal engine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Corin’s perceptual filter: “tepid dishwater” robe, “patient mathematics,” lukewarm heat—diction consistent with self-deprecating mage. Rhythm breathes: long lyrical opener contracts to clipped “It was not loud.” No dialogue, so no head-hop risk. Compression taught early (“dripping rates”) and paid off in final whisper. Register stable; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: opening cumulative sentence mirrors frozen river, then tightens into procedural beats. Metaphors stay consistent—sound as liquid, silence as honey. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Minor density alert: “blue fire” + “gemstone river” in same sentence, but logic holds (light scattering). Closing line earns resonance without abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: cosmic plumber mage who treats universal balance as hydrology problem. Transformation of “lukewarm” from insult to engine of change feels inevitable. Risky refusal of miracle ending paid off by conceptual re-pricing. Specific detail (spider-silk instruments, morning dew calipers) grounds originality. Not radical in structure but synthesizes familiar underdog trope with new metaphor system.</comment>
