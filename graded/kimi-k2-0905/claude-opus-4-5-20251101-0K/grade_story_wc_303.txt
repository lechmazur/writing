<comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—coffee stains, fern whispers, velvet pulse give Mira a singular sensorium. Contradictory impulses (promise‐keeping vs cultural witness) coexist in the same beats, and her final choice shatters the violin only after we’ve felt the cost in her burning palms and forsworn glow. The mulberry‐ache tonality is character-specific, not decorative. Minor slip: “diagnostic” phrase “empire that had traded its future for frozen music” could be more lived-in, but it doesn’t flatten the climax.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the melted ice-dust constellation reweights ownership itself, felt cost is the forsworn glow and hunted future. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stain-prophecy, fern-memory, violin-song layers until the dome burst reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and velvet observatory rules stay consistent. No causal breaks; every beat (reading stains, fern counsel, propagate choice) is tethered to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet dome functions as both acoustic tool and social pressure-cooker, literally amplifying the propagate act; its plum-colored fabric is returned in the final sparkle of ice dust. Micro-setting (palms against warm velvet, brass coffee urn) constrains the only possible stage for the song’s release. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory and tactile over visual, matching Mira’s profession. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from table to dome apex.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cultural survival vs imperial ownership—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when the promise’s glow literally fades. Escalation is driven by her decision to play once, foreclosing delivery and igniting war; price is immediate (violin lost, forsworn status). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each reverb of song deepens the irreversible cost. Empire remains off-stage but the threatened burnings are viscerally priced on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of perforating destiny emerges through the coffee-stain tear and the shattering violin, never moralized. “Some destinies were meant to be perforated” lands as earned CR, not statement. Subtext in fern whispers and ice-dust reclaims erased culture without exposition. Final image invites reader to weigh propagation against empire without tidy resolve; ambiguity is charged, not vague.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled—velvet/bruised-plum/mulberry-ache diction stays within researcher-poet lexicon. Rhythm swells with sentence crescendo as bow approaches final note; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is scopic-acoustic (stains=scores, dome=ear) unique to Mira. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination; interior monologue avoids therapeutic gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty (image, pressure, world rule) with high density; only two mild scaffold phrases (“like a living thing”, “waiting for someone to disturb them”) but they echo fern patience, forgiven. Metaphors are coherent—velvet as ear, ice as constellation—and paid off. No synonym loops or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into one-run sentence at violin burst; paragraph cut test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of provenance scholarship with acoustic ice violin is fresh; propagate-through-song subverts expected theft/heist arc. “Perforated destiny” concept materializes as literal tear in coffee stain, then as shattering instrument—idea made tactile. Velvet observatory and plant-telepathy feel inevitable, not bolted on. Risk in taking a quiet, lyric rebellion rather than battlefield pays off; reader left reweighting ownership itself.</comment>
