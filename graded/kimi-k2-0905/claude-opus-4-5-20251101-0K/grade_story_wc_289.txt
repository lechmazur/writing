<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradiction between her mechanical competence and her felt emptiness is shown through the micro-choice of writing her own letter and releasing it. The twig spiral anchors her vocation via childhood memory and constrains her present moment—an earned, visible cost. Emotions are embodied (“lighter hands”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation—writing differently tomorrow—lands as credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the self-addressed letter dissolves among others, crystallizing her altered stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (lotus, spheres, spiral) reweights the stake of connection. Anchors (who/where/when) are legible within 120 words; no orientation penalty. Cost is legible in the final image; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and recurring object (twig spiral) constrain choice and charge the final image. The lotus temple and floating spheres provide tactile, spatial pressure—she must descend to the water to release her letter. Post-storm light is filtered through her perceptual bias, guiding the rainbowed quiet. Micro-setting (inkwell balanced on marble) mirrors precarity of vocation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss of authentic connection—signals early. One meaningful deepening: realization that the art installation offers “presence, not permanence” reweights her tactics and prompts her to write for herself. Escalation is textural: density of secrets in the water intensifies the cost of her own omission. Agency is renunciation/release; price is the dissolution of her own secret among strangers’.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particular images—nest spiral, floating spheres, lotus closing—never abstract assertion. Final image reweights “connection as daily practice” without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (toe disturbing reflection) and silence. The thrush-as-builder metaphor reframes letter-writing as instinctive architecture, tying protagonist arc to thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: selective attention to water-light, spiral geometry, ink balanced on marble. Rhythmic control under pressure: short, breath-like sentences during release mirror the moment’s delicacy. No dialogue; interior texture stays consistent. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon—no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences advance story, image, and theme (“prismatic quiet… scattered… across the lily pads”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and local—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates at release then quiets into closure. Minor filter verbs (“she understood”) are voice-motivated and paid off within two lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle: professional love-letter ghostwriter confronts her own inarticulacy via public secrets dissolving in a temple pond. Thrush-nest spiral as vocational origin feels inevitable, not quirky. Risky lyric accumulation (lotus, spheres, spiral) pays off in final Charged Poise. Specificity of “prismatic quiet” and “inevitable, whimsical” prophecy avoids generic uplift.</comment>
