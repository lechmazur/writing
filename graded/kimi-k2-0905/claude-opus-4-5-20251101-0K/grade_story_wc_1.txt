<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—yearning for beauty yet complicit in a dirty trade—arrives early and drives the ledger decoding. The embodied poison tremor/quick temperature adjustments link body to craft; the “pause” epiphany is earned because we have watched her test it against frost/ledger in real time. Cost is legible: she forfeits patron income and steps into uncertain self-commissions. Voice stays singular; no external status crucible but internal split suffices for single-POV default.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens: each image (frost, starlight, poison memory) layers density until the ledger/frost homology re-weights meaning. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: her future art will monetize the very patterns that once marked her expendable—cost framed as professional exile. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint is the poison legacy (“scorched testament”) that now reroutes her craft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Canyon, frost, and charcoal strip all act as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices; frost literally rewrites the ledger before her eyes. Spatial choreography clean: stone seat, satchel angle, climbing path track. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile cold and visual star/glass analogies—apt for glass artist POV. Final frost-light rainbow scatters through residual crystals, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she revalue her art after learning she was catalogued as expendable—tightens when frost decodes “valuable & expendable” on the strip. Agency: her tracing the frost is an active intervention that forecloses return to patronage. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she accepts financial uncertainty for aesthetic autonomy. No coincidence; poison already inverted patron’s plan.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty’s independence from commerce emerges concretely via frost/ledger homology rather than assertion. Subtext in “luminous” versus “scorched” light keeps moral ambiguity alive—she profits from smuggler data yet rejects patron. Final image of “seeds of light” offers quiet repricing without sermon. Complexity remains: she still needs markets, just not that market.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, furnace-warmed diction (“glass-sharp light,” “molten gold”) stays within artist’s perceptual lexicon. Sentence rhythm lengthens for star-wheeling contemplation, shortens for decoding beats—controlled modulation. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered through tactile verbs (cupped palms, smudged charcoal). Frost/ledger cipher taught and paid off within POV knowledge limits.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors (cathedral walls, molten gold) are spare, mixed only when pressure low, and never obfuscate action. High density: “numbers became names” compresses entire revelation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with canyon cold and dawn acceleration. Clean copy—no tense slips or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frost-as-cipher is fresh, grows from character’s craft lens, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Smuggler data on artists’ expendability flips the patron-artist trope without moral lecture. Canyon setting fused with glass-making vocabulary yields singular texture. Risk in quiet ending justified: conceptual repricing lands with audible shift in livelihood. Could edge higher if cipher mechanics were seeded even earlier.</comment>
