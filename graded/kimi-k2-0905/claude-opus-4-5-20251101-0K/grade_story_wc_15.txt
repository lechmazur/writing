<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meren’s interiority is evocative—her memories of grandmother and mother braid with present action—but the “decision” to weave the paths is front-loaded as inherited destiny rather than a visible micro-choice under pressure. The bone needle and hair thread are tactile anchors, yet their procurement and meaning are summarized, not dramatized, softening the felt cost. Still, her stance crystallizes in the final image, and the contradiction between tradition and mercy is embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth is re-imagined from prison to garden, cost paid by seventeen years of secret mapping and the invisible surrender of ancestral cruelty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake—though the causal chain of “sewing paths that sleepwalkers can later walk” remains slightly magical rather than mechanically evidenced. Orientation is secure within 120 words; transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, salt-crusted basins, and bone needle form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move; the illustration plate recharges the ending when Meren holds it to starlight. Sensory economy is excellent—only three smells, two textures, but each returns to reconfigure meaning. Spatial choreography stays crisp despite off-stage geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate future walkers from cruelty—tightens when Meren defies precedent; the single deepening is the stitch that merges three dream-paths, foreclosing her ability to remain neutral. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts the label of desecration. Agency is present yet slightly abstract because the sewing happens after the paths have already been walked; we see the result more than the struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inversion of ordeal into invitation, seeded in the grandmother-to-Meren generational contrast and ripened in the final garden image. Subtext is carried by the empty tide pools and the plate’s painted whales—ruin and reverence coexist without sermon. No thematic echo is declared; the final “orchid solace” line is brief enough to skirt overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Meren’s perceptual filter: she sees moonlit water that never existed, feels “ancient breath” in stone, speaks of “phantom fishing boats.” Syntax lengthens in reflective paragraphs, shortens during sewing, mirroring breath. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; the prose itself becomes her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes—long sentences for memory, staccato for needlework—without template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned (water, breath, thread) and pays off in the starlit plate image. One scaffold detected: “paths…paths…paths” triplet in paragraph four; minor, does not obscure causality. Opening and closing images are propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sleep-weaver who stitches dream cartography into stone feels unprecedented; familiar tropes—labyrinth, oracle bone, generational craft—are re-cast through unconscious footfall cartography. Risk is high but coherent: lyrical exposition and magical causality could have broken, yet the accumulative texture lands. Specificity of “whales passing through corridors” re-weights the whole mythos.</comment>
