<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s interiority is vivid (“clocks that ran backward, so wrongness felt like home”), embodied grief drives every micro-choice, and the yoyo-cast that snatches his daughter’s laughter crystallizes a cost that justifies his vanished future. The flaw: the daughter remains off-page memory, so the relationship crucible is off-stage; the only live pressure is between man and time, not between people. Still, his flaw—obsessive retro-engineering—compounds to the exit beat, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands clean: the counter-clockwise beam drags him bodily through a door that forecloses return, a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—each backward gear in the yoyo pays forward to the lighthouse lens reversal—so the lens (Causal) holds. The missing orientation debt is waived because disorientation (“spiraled wrong”) is the pattern taught early and paid off at exit. Only nit: the seventeen-year corpse is never inspected or causal, a faint Chekhov-dust bunny that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Every black vertebra-rock and tide-pool breath is filtered through Alaric’s clock-maker eye; the lighthouse architecture literally steers his body up backward stairs that later invert the beam. The hunger stone evolves from prop to key—its glow and carved coordinates constrain his route onto the island and then unlock the portal—meeting the 9+ gate. Micro-setting triumph: the yoyo’s guts become the world’s guts. Minor slip: “Dresden” is named once but never exploited for geist or historical weight, a missed specificity tweak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewind time to save daughter—signals early and tightens twice: first when the yoyo guts reveal counter-causality gears, second when the beam actually starts unwinding night. Each step narrows his real-world future to zero. Cost is visceral: casting the yoyo he “pulls… a sound: his daughter’s laughter… distant but real,” trading his present coherence for one auditory glimpse—an on-page price that charges the final image under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: time as repairable mechanism vs. time as irreversible grief. The hunger stone’s medieval warning is repriced from “weep for drought” to “weep for beauty of hidden access,” a conceptual shift that fuses drought of water with drought of presence. Daughter-laughter echo supplies the emotional aftertaste. Only a trace of sermonizing in the clause “to prove that destiny was just another mechanism” keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Alaric’s perceptual signature: gears, counter-rotations, latencies. Syntax mirrors his mind—“spiraled wrong,” “wrongness felt like home”—and compresses under peak stress into fragmented percussive clauses as the beam ignites. No dialogue, hence no voice drift. Free indirect (“He understood then…”) is clean and character-bound. Near 9.0 but a few filter verbs (“he could only describe”) dull the final thrust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, largely scaffold-free; every sentence layers image with motive (“toolbox rattling against the hunger stone”). Mixed-metaphor watch passes: “the ocean holding its breath” and “fishing line cast into deeper waters” cohere under an angler/respiration motif. One paraphrase loop—“latent radiance, light that had always been present but never expressed”—costs a −0.2, preventing 8.3. Otherwise momentum breathes with scene tide.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of backward-clockmaker, drought-marking hunger stone, and yoyo-as-temporal-fishing-reel feels freshly non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky structural choice—counter-clock stairs, lens, and tide—becomes the literal exit rather than a gimmick. Emotional specificity (dead daughter → auditory echo) grounds the speculative frame. Only a faint scent of prompt-checklist in the neat bundling of all nine required elements keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
