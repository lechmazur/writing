<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—rational artist vs. inheritor of mystic duty—remains embodied and specific; the moment she presses the slide to lightning her body choice crystallizes the alliance stake. Flaw is minimal: “mechanical lullaby” drifts toward label-speak in the final beat, a hair below 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lightning layer reweights the slide’s meaning, tightening until the final image of “bridge-shadow” reconfigures her path; cost is the foreclosure of solitary art-for-art’s-sake. Orientation clean by line 5; closure lands with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Archway, storm, and lantern slide each constrain choice: granite offers back-rest, slide demands lightning angle, wind sets clock for revelation. Micro-setting (palm-sized glass) literally steers final tactic; no 9-band only because salt-air physics stays generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—join or ignore cross-era alliance—tightens three times: GPS death, slide-layer reveal, bridge-shadow exit; each escalation is driven by her attention choices under storm pressure. Cost is loss of autonomous artistry; legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrence of “scaffold complexity with simplicity” enacted in wood, glass, storm-built stone; no moralizing statement. Final image of “eternity speak” in driftwood reweights prior sculptures as messages, achieving CR without abstract declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Marina’s perceptual filter—wind “like a turbine’s hum” mirrors her sculptor ear for rhythm. Compression taught early (“patterns she hadn’t carved”) pays off at closure; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with storm cadence—short slashes for rain, elongated clauses for reverie; no loops or mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often layers GPS failure, electromagnetic chaos, and alliance signal. Minor scaffold: “she would...she would...” future loop in penultimate paragraph trims 0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drift-worn sculptor as inheritor of geologic-lantern archive; trope of generational magic transformed through material practice. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Specificity of “twisted forms the sea discarded” makes alliance feel discovered, not invented.</comment>
