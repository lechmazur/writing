<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s “resiliently positive” stance is shown through breezy dialogue and the decision to up-end the hourglass; the split-self pain at the end gives a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“gripped the rusted railing…smelled of salt and static electricity”). The flickering passengers function as pressure backdrop rather than relationship crucible, so status/secondary-char bullets stay muted, but her own contradictory impulse—laugh while splitting—reads cleanly. One causality bump: the grandmother’s rule-set is delivered in a single inherited line; the leap from “time runs in” to net-repair is asserted, not dramatized, keeping this just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ferry solidifies, Mara remains aboard holding now-star-filled hourglass—her refusal to disembark prices her with eternal repair duty. Lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of phosphorescence / radio voices / stellar reflections accrete until the “up-end” reweights reality. Orientation is taught by word 17 (“the ferry had been vanishing”) and pays off; no penalty. Persistent constraint established: she is the only whole survivor and must repeat the ritual; cost is legible in the closing image. Minor slip: the divergence moment (“choosing left instead of right”) is told in summary rather than shown, preventing a perfect 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The Meridian itself, the spectral grotto, and the hourglass all constrain choice and charge the final image. Environment drives action: only inside the grotto can Mara collect lost seconds; starlight ceiling and phosphorescent water guide the pattern she follows. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“spray that smelled of salt and static electricity”). Spatial choreography stays coherent across the dissolve/re-solidify sequence. World-rules are taught through observation, not exposition. Slight over-reliance on visual channel; other senses appear only once each, keeping this below 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake = rescue the passengers by merging timelines; signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation occurs once: realization that hourglass can pour time back → instant bodily cost when she splits. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates (ferry horn, radio voices) but does not resolve. Cost is visible—her selves split and she stays exiled aboard—satisfying the 8.8+ price test. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no second tightening beat, so just reaches 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: time as repairable net rather than irreversible river; persistence of compassion in impossible systems. Motifs (hourglass, starlight, radio static) recur with shifting significance and charge the final image. Subtext lives in gesture—knitting grows, child actually cries—rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise: perpetual deckhand ferrying lost souls, a resonant answer without moral. Only hedge: one near-thesis line from grandmother (“Time runs out…”) costs −0.2; still lands above 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual signature: “bright edge of someone who had accepted the impossible and decided to smile anyway.” Syntax tightens under stress—fragments appear as ferry dissolves. No head-hopping; passengers remain opaque, correctly. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within deckhand lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for drifting, staccato for split-self pain. Distinctive, publish-ready voice with only a hairline cliché (“smelled of salt and static electricity”) holding it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere); no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (net, static, starlight) and do not crowd high-pressure beat. One template cadence run: three “The ___” openers in close succession (−0.2). Opening and closing lines are sharp, propulsive. Information density high; paragraph cuts clean. Minor proof blemish—“businesssman” typo—does not dull closure. Overall clean enough for immediate print, minor copy-edit only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: commuter-ferry disappearance re-imagined as cosmic repair-job, grounded in working-class deckhand POV. Risk taken—lyric accumulation, non-linear time—yet closure remains legible. Hourglass emptied to collect time is a specific, non-obvious twist that feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice, world, theme cohere into singular stance. Transformation test passes: swap names and concept collapses. Meets 9+ standard with minor hairline slip (template cadence) not touching closure.</comment>
