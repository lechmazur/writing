<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elena’s “kindly methodical” interiority is vivid—she catalogs grief like verb paradigms—yet the caretaker arrives as plot-spokesman rather than pressure-source; the final endurance (“she would stay”) is earned by accumulated image, not by a crucible-choice that costs her a live alternative, so the 9+ quick test narrowly fails.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the seed-grown fruit makes the physics of transition felt in her mouth, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as pattern—clay, seed, magnetic soil—deepens to cadence shift; orientation is anchored by rung 120; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sideways-rooted, lodestone-threaded trees supply micro-setting that literally enables the knowledge fruit; magnetic dust sparkles under fingernails, constraining the final choice to plant; the arbor’s windless sway is a charged environmental mirror of grief’s suspension—meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>The dominant stake—“what happens in the moment of transition?”—tightens once: seed → fruit → tasted understanding forecloses earthly academic life; price is the irreversible swallow of luminous flesh; agency is attention/planting, not combat, fitting Accumulative lens; cost is legible, though second pressure-turn absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: translation as ontological continuation rather than loss; the final image of “grammar of passage” reweights prior clay/seed motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—does ingested knowledge erase or transmute grief—earning resonance; no echo-chamber thesis lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Elena’s shoulder with cuneiform-specific perceptual signature—“her fingers still stained with clay dust”—and controlled psychic distance; syntax lengthens calmly, mirroring methodical patience; no head-hops; caretaker diction suitably weathered; final luminous bite carries tactile immediacy; rhythmic propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Lines multitask: “fruit that glowed faintly blue in the eternal twilight above the world” sets scene + stakes + tone; no filter-verb clusters; figurative language sparse, precise; magnetic dust / clay recurrence avoids synonym churn; opening and closing images (clay(seed(fruit))) form clean bracket; minor scaffold: “she thought of... she thought of” could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fusion of Assyriologist procedural with soul-physics orchard feels inevitable yet unmined; trope inversion—academic becomes arborist of epistemology—grows from character flaw (patience as existential engine); risk in quiet ending pays off via conceptual reprice rather than spectacle; specificity of cuneiform verb forms roots abstraction in lived craft.</comment>
