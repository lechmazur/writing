<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Meridia’s refusal to sell her body is a sharp, embodied contradiction that drives every beat; her choice to harvest the echoes is the natural culmination of that stance. The “army she carried within her” moment crystallizes a credible, earned inheritance rather than an epiphany. Interiority stays specific and sensorial, though a few phrases (“architecture of boundaries”) flirt with abstraction. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of anonymity and steps into the role of teacher—visible, targeted, but finally whole.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism dims, the threads are gone, and Meridia’s solitude is permanently rewired into collectivity. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each untangled thread thickens the ancestral texture until the final inhale reweights her identity. The orientation is immediate (snow, courtyard, naked shoulders), and the lens holds. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: she is warm despite the snow, carrying voices that will now speak through her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, prism, and falling snow are not backdrop but instrument: the cold bites her skin, the prism refracts starlight onto her body, the snow muffles sound so the whispers can surface. Spatial choreography is pristine—she kneels, rises, walks back—every move tracked. The micro-setting of her bare shoulders against winter crystallizes the stakes: exposure, vulnerability, refusal. Weather and geometry converge to force the harvest; without them, the echo-knots have no medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“remain sovereign over her body while reclaiming ancestral voice”—tightens when each untangled thread eliminates the option of remaining merely the Untouched Muse. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the accumulating load of inherited silence. The final turn forecloses anonymity: she will now teach, becoming visible to patrons and pimps alike. Cost is visible on the page when the prism dims and the cold no longer touches her—she has traded insulation for ignition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lullaby of conformity versus the anthem of sovereign choice emerges through concrete inheritance rather than slogan. The prism’s rainbow fragments reprice the reader’s sense of intimacy: what looked like solitary light is revealed as communal refraction. The final smile is not moral but ontological—she becomes a conduit, not a symbol. Theme resists tidy feminism: chastity is neither purity nor prudence but tactical architecture, and the echo-harvest is not victory but ongoing obligation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Meridia’s skin, filtering every image through her bodily poetic: snow is “silver courtyard silence,” threads are “gossamer strands of light.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with the untangling rhythm, teaching the reader the pattern without exposition. No head-hopping; the collective voices arrive as overheard whispers, not interior invasion. Register remains sensual and slightly archaic, matching the Velvet House’s self-mythology while staying believable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Paragraph lengths swell and contract like breath, mirroring the untangling cadence. Metaphors are stacked but purposeful—each knot is a “voice, a memory, a piece of someone”—creating a texture that justifies its own density. No loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances the harvest or deepens the cold. Occasional elevated diction (“ontological,” “sovereign choice”) skirts register drift yet feels earned by the ceremonial stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The courtesan-who-refuses-sex is familiar, but the echo-harvest reframes abstinence as archival activism rather than virtue. The prism sanctuary evolves from new-age prop to genealogical server rack—an image I haven’t seen. Bodily poetic as inscription technology feels fresh: movement as data retrieval. Risk is taken: a largely static scene hung on lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals, and it pays off.</comment>
