<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s scars-as-maps interiority is vivid and specifically embodied; the root-binding curse is shown through her inability to step free even at the climax. Contradictory impulses—yearning to cross the dream-door while physically anchored—are active in the final beat. The moment she recognizes her role as living bridge lands as earned stasis with visible cost: “her roots strained against their earthly anchor.” Secondary characters remain emblematic; only their scars micro-differentiate them, so the relationship crucible is weak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the door of overlapping shadows crystallizes options—cross collectively or stay rooted—while the price (Mira’s permanent anchoring) is felt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scar-mapping and hedge-rebuilding thickens until the maze reconfigures reality. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cobalt glade at dusk”), well inside the 120-word allowance. Causality is intact: clipping → root growth → maze re-formation → door appearance, each step because/therefore linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s bruise-colored dusk and root-tangled soil are filtered through Mira’s bodily priorities; the hedge regrowth is handled in tactile, lived-in detail. The topiary clipping functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—she must plant it to summon the maze. Spatial choreography is clean: seven strangers approach, form ring, hand-link without drift. Weather/light remain static, but the shifting hedge geometry supplies dynamic environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the shadow-door appears. Escalation is a single deepening: the maze rebuilds outward rather than upward, foreclosing physical escape and forcing collective decision. Cost is visible: Mira’s roots “strain,” anchoring her forever. Agency is shared—Mira plants, others link scars—but the final image reweights options for all eight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartographies of trauma (scars) become communal maps to transcendence. The topiary clipping and root-binding reprise at the end re-price the premise—immobility as gift, not curse. No meta-commentary; meaning accrues through image of door built from overlapping shadows. Ambiguity lingers: is collective dreaming liberation or new colonization? Reader left to weigh cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly interior to Mira; perceptual signature is botanical and somatic—“roots she had cultivated herself,” “hummed against her skin like a tuning fork.” Rhythm modulates: lyrical open, compressed urgency during maze growth, stateliness at the Charged Poise. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Metaphor chain (bruise sky, tuning fork, overlapping shadows) is purposeful and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear varied; sentence lengths contract during hedge eruption to mimic speed. Information density high—e.g., “Stars aligned decades ahead of schedule, and the eclipsed covenant…shattered” world-builds in one line. Two mixed-metaphor risks—“color of bruises and promises” and “door made of overlapping shadows”—but both pay off thematically. Minor loop: “roots…roots” repetition in paragraph 11; not at closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope mash-up—chosen one, dream-web, magical maze—is refreshed by scar-topography mechanics and inversion of immobility as power. Specific detail—“keloid tissue formed spiraling paths,” “scratches that spelled words in no waking language”—creates memorable grotesque. Risk taken in collective rather than solitary transcendence; coherence holds. Synthesis feels inevitable: root-bound gardener becomes literal root-bridge.</comment>
