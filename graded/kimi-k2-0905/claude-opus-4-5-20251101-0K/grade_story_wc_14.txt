<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mei’s monastic ritual of charting lamp-hums is a compelling, idiosyncratic obsession that drives every action; her interior contradiction—collecting intangible dawns to sell as tangible paper—peaks when she tastes “ash and wedding cake” and still keeps climbing. The inherited compulsion arrives fully motivated, but the story never tests her commitment with a live temptation or visible forfeiture; closure is a quiet reiteration rather than a cost-bearing renunciation. Micro-choices (opening the notepad, tracing the spine) are concrete, yet they do not narrow her future or foreclose a path. Earned Stasis is present, but the price feels abstract—she simply descends again—so the arc hovers just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mei tracing the worn spine reweights every prior dawn into embodied capital she can never spend, only carry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each numbered hum layers density until the catalogue itself becomes the irreversible cost. Orientation is swift (gilded-leaf stationer, mountain path, pre-dawn) and causality remains intact; no prop or rule is broken. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally—no blood, no broken lamp, no missed sunrise—so the repricing is elegant but not yet wrenching.</comment>

<comment>The blooming bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but engine: its spiral forces Mei’s repetitive climb, its impossible blossoms refract the lamp-light she must record, and their ancient patience contrasts her consumptive cataloguing—environment that charges the final image. Every sensory pick is filtered through her paper-maker’s bias (gold leaf, cedar, “tastes of ash and wedding cake”), so the mountain becomes a texture quarry, not scenery. Spatial choreography is pristine: she enters, reaches center, exits, same path, same silence, yet the trees’ micro-seasons mark invisible time. The setting constrains her choice to keep ascending, making the labyrinth indispensable to stakes and closure.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—preserve intangible dawns before they vanish—tightens through lower-frequency hums and accumulating pages, but pressure is ambient, not adversarial; no external force threatens the lamp or shop. The 744th entry marks a micro-turn (mournful tone) that deepens rather than narrows options; Mei’s agency is to persist, not sacrifice. Cost is present but abstract: the growing weight of unspent textures in her notepad spine. Escalation is subtle cadence shift, sufficient for Accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible price that alters her next climb—hence stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is a commodity that devalues the rememberer. Subtext operates through tactile synesthesia (hum = taste) and the widow’s unexplained tears—paper that rewrites grief without mentioning grief. The final image of worn spine-as-archive offers a resonant, non-moral answer: cataloguing time replaces living inside it. No sentence moralizes; the concept reprices itself.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mei’s perceptual filter—synesthetic taste of electricity, paper-maker’s mineral eye—never slipping into monk or customer mind. Syntax glides from lyrical long sentences to staccato note-taking (“Dawn 744 - 58.3 Hz”) that mirrors her cataloguing obsession. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; diction stays within her craft lexicon without sudden graduate-seminar lifts. The lamp’s flicker is described with the same reverence as cherry petals—cosmic and domestic registers seamlessly fused.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “Cherry blossoms fell like pink snow” carries fresh synesthesia without cliché because next clause grounds it in cedar patience. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; each sentence layers texture or advances ritual. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line recharges “worn spine” as archive of intangible dawns—image reweights all prior material. Micro-blemish: “impossibly old” appears twice in 200 words, a hairline echo that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—stationer harvesting fluorescent-lamp spectra at dawn to manufacture paper that carries invented histories—is a wild, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable once begun. Risk of preciousness is averted by concrete mechanics (Hz readings, ash-and-cake taste) and social payoff (mayor’s victory, widow’s tears). The bonsai labyrinth reframes eco-gothic trope into miniature time garden; generational obsession becomes quiet capitalist critique. Transformation test fails: swap stationer for baker and entire conceptual scaffold collapses—proof of irreducible originality.</comment>
