<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s interiority is lyrically dense but remains observational; she never makes a high-stakes choice that visibly costs her something. The mallet-handling beats are tactile, yet her stance toward the new wreck is static appreciation rather than dilemma. Without a tightening fork where refusal or risk is dramatized, the arc is a steady-state meditation, not a crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers sensory refrains (clouds, salt-creak, struck wood) until the final “one note at a time” crystallizes the reframing of wreckage into music. Orientation is swift and anchored in the body at the orchard’s edge; transitions are unnecessary in this single drifting shard. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the perpetual drift—earned by the iterative dubbing pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard is evoked through sound, flex, and salt taste; every tool (mallet, hull, nets) doubles as micro-setting that constrains how music can be harvested. Spatial tracking is clean—no impossible drift or warp. The 9+ gate is missed because no single environmental detail forces a tactical shift at the end; the orchard remains a gorgeous constant rather than a variable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform incoming wreckage into song—announced early; pressure is steady but flat: each new fragment merely extends the same task. No beat narrows options or raises cost (no broken mallet, no storm that threatens the raft). Escalation is decorative (more debris coming) rather than tactical; the prophet’s agency never faces a fork where failure is possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation-through-sound emerges organically from iterative dubbing; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image reweights the premise: destruction becomes “almost like meaning,” achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext could sharpen if the cost of this meaning were probed—does something get lost when grief is tuned into beauty?—but the restraint is valid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent salt-stiffened cadence; perceptual signature is cloud-reading, timber-toned, wave-counted. No head-hopping; distance remains contemplative. Syntax modulates with longer anaphoric sweeps at climax (“The sea took everything…”). No dialogue to test, yet diction stays within a weather-reader’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned (fractal, spiral, echo) and justified by the prophet’s vocation; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. One paraphrase loop (“wreckage… obstacle… wreckage”) costs −0.2; otherwise compression is strong. Rhythm breathes with the blue-hour fade; no scaffold sentences. Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating sound-orchard is a fresh, risk-laden premise; the refusal to explain how apples survive salt signals confidence. Fractal cloud-reading and musical wreck-dubbing synthesize weather lore and salvage art into an organic whole. The concept is memorable and inseparable from this voice; swapping setting or instrument would collapse the story. Risk distinction +0.3 for committing fully to the lyric without plotty pay-off.</comment>
