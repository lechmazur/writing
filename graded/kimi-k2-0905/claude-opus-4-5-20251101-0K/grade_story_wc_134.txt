<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her sudden blindness to the future is embodied in the pilgrim’s blood-map and her own racing pulse. The moment she chooses the pearl, the cost is felt: “She wept… she had missed the miracles breathing in every ordinary second.” Yet the arc leans toward epiphany rather than contradiction; the final smile is earned but not deeply scarred.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearl reweights Vera’s vocation from future-fixation to present-awe, with unmistakable cost—“dawn breaking in colors she had never truly noticed.” Causal chain holds: pilgrim’s death → map → descent → pearl → present-sight. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cave’s singing crystals constrain pace and perception—song deepens into language, colors bleed with each step, forcing Vera to “walk blind.” The pearl’s alcove, worn smooth by millennia of drips, charges the final image: moonlight she can hold. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she trade prophecy for present wonder?—is signaled early and tightens when shadows overlap and the song becomes language. The pearl-touch is the single decisive turn that forecloses the old path. Cost is legible in her tears and the dawn she finally sees; a second reversal or higher price would push this into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the magic already lives in ordinary seconds, not distant futures. The final image of dawn reweights every prior vision without moralizing. One soft spot: “everyday magic, multiplied a thousandfold” flirts with echoing the prompt; still, the weeping moment earns the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—“colors she had never truly noticed.” Syntax swells and contracts with cave song and pulse. No head-hopping or register drift; lyric repetition is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, rhythmic, largely loop-free; occasional modifier stacks (“haunting melodies that echoed through the mountain”) slightly dilute urgency. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. A tighter cut on some adjectives would lift this toward 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combining clairvoyant blindness, singing cave, and moonlight pearl feels fresh; the inversion that prophecy is the lesser gift is non-obvious. Risk is moderate—lyric descent into present-sight rather than battle—but execution is coherent. A bolder structural gamble could push higher.</comment>
