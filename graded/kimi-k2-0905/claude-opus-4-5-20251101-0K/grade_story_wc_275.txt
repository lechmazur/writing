<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifist inversion of her father’s legacy is vivid: she presses thorns soft, pockets the ballast, and refuses the knife. The internal contradiction—hunter training vs. plant-gentling—plays live in scene, not summary. Cost is paid: she kneels on the buried bounty badge, literally and symbolically. Only the soldier’s beat feels observed, not altered, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each rose-tending beat thickens the pattern of refusal until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchored by word 20; no lens drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dome’s “blazing tranquilly” reweights all prior violence, cost legible in the kneeling-on-badge scar and the knife left sheathed. Persistent constraint—the dome’s glass and the sandbag pouch—shape every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dome’s copper-filtered light is both atmosphere and pressure: it lets roses live but exposes refugees. Ballast scrap functions as micro-setting, its weight turned to seed-vessel. Spatial choreography is clean—east-panel roses vibrate, soldier enters bleeding, bench placement exact. Final image of “blazing tranquilly” ties environment to moral stance, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Mira repeat or repudiate her father’s violence? One tightening: she reaches for knife, then sheathes it; option foreclosed. Cost is visible—she risks welcoming a wounded enemy—but external threat stays abstract; soldier’s desperation never endangers her life, muting escalation. Still, the refusal is causal under Accumulative lens and pays into the final poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of bounty-hunter tools into gardening instruments; no moral is declared. “Teaching roses to forgive” is literal action, not metaphoric tag. Final image reconfigures tower’s collapse into dome’s calm without sermon. Subtext in the soldier’s tears and Mira’s silence lets readers feel mercy as rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly sewn to Mira’s perceptual filter: “copper-tinted soil,” “roses’ small green thoughts.” Syntax lengthens with meditative rhythm, then clipped when soldier enters—micro modulation. No head-hopping; soldier’s interior is read only through Mira’s gift, preserving distance. Diction stays within desert-gardener idiom; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long breathy sentences for dome calm, short clauses for intrusion. Information dense—one line can set, sense, and symbol: “weight released, descent chosen.” No mixed metaphors; ballast-to-seed logic stays physical and moral. Minor scaffold: “the practice centered her, weaving continuity…” could compress, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter is fresh; using ballast sand as seed pouch is specific synthesis. Roses taught mercy literalizes forgiveness without allegorical stiffness. Risk: lyric horticulture could read precious, but grounding detail—kneeling on buried badge—keeps it earned. Final “tranquil blaze” reweights trope of apocalyptic fire into cultivated light.</comment>
