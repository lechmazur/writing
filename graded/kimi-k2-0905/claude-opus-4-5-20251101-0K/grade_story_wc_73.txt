<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s grim optimism is lived-in: she keeps climbing after “centuries,” chalks equations on the very steps that imprison her. The interior contradiction—hope against despair—drives every micro-choice (roll the dice, kneel, press palm to crack). The final Earned Stasis (she keeps climbing, chip smoother, grief-engine humming) is fully earned by her prior obsession with crystallizing regret. Only minor leakage: “grim optimist” is named once in opening exposition rather than dramatized first.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crack seals with her on the “other side,” grief-engine now internalized, cost felt in the warmer stone and smoother die. Causal chain holds: dice roll → 8th step → crack → chalk-proof → rupture → sealed passage. Infinite-stair rule-set stays consistent; no teleporting props. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 3; the mild initial disorientation (time has no meaning) is taught and pays off thematically, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The staircase as micro-setting constrains every move: steps absorb light, provide chalk, groan when violated. The cracked step and chalk-dust texture physically guide her equations and her final hand-press; the “warmer stone” on the new staircase is the charged image that reweights the closure. Sensory economy is tight—no visual clichés, only selective pale/golden light. Spatial logic is flawless: she climbs, kneels, writes, crosses, and the geography stays trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled early and escalates through each mathematical test. The dice roll tightens options: eight steps up, she MUST find the predicted crack. The rupture moment forces a trade-off—she crosses, sealing her eternal climb with grief-engine intact. Cost is visible: warmer stone, smoother die, eternal continuation—no escape, only internalized perpetual motion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: perpetual motion = grief chasing hope forever. No thesis statements; the final warmer staircase reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the chipped die smoothing—imperfection worn by passage. The ending’s image (eternal climb, engine humming) offers resonant non-literal answer: regret is the fuel, not the flaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is character-specific: mathematician’s diction (“stress fractals,” “golden ratio”) filtered through grief-poetry (“texture of a missed opportunity,” “door that closed”). Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences for ascent, staccato bursts at rupture. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly Vera-bound. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a scientist in extremis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “chalk she’d made from grinding steps she’d already passed” does triple duty (world rule, resource, emotional recycling). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“universe clearing its throat”). Syntax varies: fragments used only at rupture beat for propulsion. Copy-clean except one comma splice that reads intentional for breathless ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: infinite staircase as physics lab for grief-powered perpetual motion. Dice-with-chip becomes literal engine part; cracked step as experimental apparatus. Risky concept committed fully—no retreat to “it was all a dream.” Specific detail (step 4012, chalk from prior steps) prevents generic nowhere setting. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
