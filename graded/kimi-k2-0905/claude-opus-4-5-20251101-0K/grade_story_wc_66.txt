<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Helena’s interiority is textured through music-anchored memory and ritualized gesture (amber dial, blanket pull) that externalize a disciplined, risk-accruing stance; the “thistled calm” line crystallizes her acceptance of permanent danger. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only recalled, so the cost is conceptually but not dramaturgically felt at the closure beat. Still, her vocation as copyist seeds the lyric-code tactic and the final image of composing tomorrow’s tale, giving the arc credible continuity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each broadcast thickens the communal “dust” layer until the final crystallization that “the story famine was ending.” Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn reveals no seized equipment, yet the invisible network now exists, reweighting Helena’s solitude with irrevocable responsibility. Cost is legible in the blanket-drawn vigil and tomorrow’s already-forming script—an ongoing endangerment rather than a single sacrifice. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no temporal or spatial ambiguity persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove’s glow, radio dial amber, and dissolving mist function as micro-setting that literally enables the crime (invisible from outside) and metaphorically charges the “banked fire” closure image. Sensory selection skews auditory (crackle, whisper) and tactile (weathered hands, blanket), mirroring a copyist’s haptic world. Spatial choreography tracks fox vs patrol sweep cleanly. Environment directly constrains every beat: mist thickness governs transmission length; dawn forces shutdown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the illegal memory-channel alive—tightens once: mist thinning = imminent exposure, so she must sign off and accept perpetual vulnerability. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the牧羊人 parable embeds coordinates that convert story into logistics, showing stakes expanding from personal survival to territory-wide resistance. Cost is the unending vigil; however, because the patrol never actually threatens on-page, the price is announced more than dramatized, capping intensity just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: cultural memory as particulate matter—dust—reclaims power when animated by art. The shepherd-who-counts-stars parable reweights loss as navigational gift, returning in the final “breadcrumbs” image to argue that narrative itself is cartography. No moral is declared; resonance is left airborne, inviting reader to inhale the dust. Subtext in Mahler/Debussy code keeps message literally beneath melody, fulfilling the “elusive song lyrics” requirement while deepening motif of clandestine beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering description through Helena’s synesthetic professionalism (notes = coordinates, silence = famine). Syntax lengthens during broadcast, mimicking phrase-on-phrase transcription, then shortens at sign-off, echoing a cadence close. No dialogue, so register remains orchestral-copyist precise: “architecture of music,” “thistled calm.” Metaphor chain of dust, stars, breadcrumbs is coherent and pattern-taught early, paying off in blanket-side composition moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Opening “ember alcove glowed” and closing “banked, waiting” form a clean ring structure. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptually contraband”) stays within a copyist’s plausible lexicon and heightens the formal stakes of cultural loss. Minor over-adornment in “mist hung heavy as velvet” is the single decorative surplus, but it doesn’t occlude clarity or slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar resistance-radio trope is re-angled through orchestral code channeling logistics into fairy tale; dust-as-data-carrier concept gives fresh physical substrate to memory politics. Specificity of copyist profession converts abstract censorship into tactile erasure of “note-by-note” labour. Risk is taken by keeping protagonist off-stage to authorities, making her power precisely her invisibility—an inversion that heightens rather than defuses tension. Synthesis feels inevitable: music, dust, story, and star-map fuse into one insurgent instrument.</comment>
