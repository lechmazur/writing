<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “turn questions into destinations” motive is stated repeatedly but only dramatized at the very end; the duel with Krell is too short to reveal contradictory impulses or cost. The mechanical arm grants competence yet no visible flaw or limit complicates her tactics. Interiority drifts into thesis-speak (“philosophy without destination was merely elegant procrastination”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sundial cipher → clandestine meeting discovery → confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change—Krell’s plot exposed—paid with shattered teacups and diplomatic pretense, satisfying cost requirement. Orientation is clear within 120 words; single-scene default met. Micro-turn (Krell’s sleeve-blade) tightens options cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, and sundial are sketched with economical sensory strokes; sundial’s code actively shapes plot, meeting the 9+ constraint test. Brass gears of Elara’s arm recur as tactile micro-setting. Spatial choreography stays coherent during the brief duel. A few decorative adjectives (“crystalline walls,” “patient song”) slightly temper economy but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent suppression of peace overture—signaled early. Escalation arrives via sundial decode and Krell’s drawn blade; Elara’s counter-threat crystallizes stance with visible cost (diplomatic mask shattered). Pressure stays causal and coherent; no coincidence resolves. Could use one tangible forfeiture (lost needle card, gear jam) to raise tactical price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-revelation versus protocol emerges through sundial, hidden card, and shattered courtesy rather than explicit moral. Subtext in Krell’s “velvet courtesy” line lands well. Final image of brook unchanged while diplomacy fractures supplies resonant reweighting. Avoids sermonizing; only minor drift toward thesis-speak in Elara’s interiority keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is philosophical but particular—she notices cipher-angles, gear-whir, ethics in motion. Diction modulates from calm observation to compressed parry syntax. Dialogue indirection works (“curious that it remains unfinished”). One register hitch: “dignified chaos of political philosophy” is abstract where a visceral image would serve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control; no template cadence or synonym loops. Sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is spare and apt (“diplomatic mask cracking”). Filter verbs minimal; information density high. Minor micro-scaffold: “as she had been for seventeen minutes now” could tighten to “seventeen minutes already.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of philosopher-duelist, steampunk arm, and sundial cipher feels fresh yet inevitable. Stakes hinge on an unfinished artwork as covert channel—specific, not stock spy trope. Transformation test passes: swap any element (arm, sundial, brook) and the story collapses. Risk in merging metaphysics with blade-drawn thriller pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
