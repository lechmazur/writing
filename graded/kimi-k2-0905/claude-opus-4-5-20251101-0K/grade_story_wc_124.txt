<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s cautious, scent-avoidant nature is embodied in every beat: she waits, uncorks only when alone, cries without forcing explanation. The inherited aversion is dramatized, not labeled, and the final choice to keep the vial feels inevitable. Interior contradiction—yearning to know vs. fear of being swept away—stays live in scene. No stock therapeutic self-talk; cost is felt in tear-tracked cheeks and low-oil lantern.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: each scent “ghost” layers density until the Silphium bloom and vial release re-weight all prior grief. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren stands in dawn light, vial against heart, options reconfigured—she is no longer afraid yet carries the price of permanent melancholy. Cost is legible in “one fewer extinction to mourn” and her swollen eyes. Pattern holds without causality breaks; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass-and-regret cathedral, UV racks, crystal sediment swirling in three drops—each detail is tactile and choice-limiting: the UV array permits the bloom, the vial’s facets refract both light and memory. Spatial choreography clean: aisle walk, central chamber, pocket-to-hand-to-light motion tracked. Environment forecloses escape; she must confront scent inside this sealed past. Micro-setting (vial interior) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she dare inhale knowledge that may drown her in inherited grief? Pressure tightens as bloom opens and lantern oil wanes—two live clocks. Micro-turn at vial uncorking narrows options: once smelled, the memory cannot be unseen. Cost paid on-page: tears, dawn departure, vial kept yet forever spent—path foreclosed, acceptance earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through synaptic scent-ghosts: extinction, memory, and the cost of resurrecting what was lost. No overt thesis—meaning accrues via “every scent was a ghost” and the final crystallized stance. Subtext in gestures: pocketing the vial equals consent to carry ancestral sorrow. Final image reweights earlier lavender/bread triggers without moralizing—resonance lingers as atmospheric after-scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Maren’s perceptual filter: mineral rain scent = locked door, resinous bloom = tear wave. Rhythm flexes—long sensuous sentences during inhalation, stubbed fragments (“Tears came.”) at impact. Lexicon of scent is precise yet never perfumery-catalog. No head-hop; Dr. Vance’s dialogue is filtered through Maren’s ears, idiom remains restrained, scientific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; no template churn. Metaphors (“cathedral of glass and regret”, “crystal shadows”) stay consistent to light/refraction motif. Information-dense: one sentence slips lantern broker past, family grief, present mission. Minor scaffold: “transformation was nearly complete” repeats—deduct 0.2. Otherwise zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Closure sentence breathes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle: olfactory extinction as inherited trauma. Silphium resurrection paired with grandmother’s scent-archive feels inevitable yet unwritten before. Risk in lyric stillness pays off—no conventional plot reversal yet stakes feel colossal. Specificity of antique-lamp brokerage and genetic de-extinction science grounds premise. Transformation test: story collapses without scent-based memory conceit.</comment>
