<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s curiosity-as-inheritance is clear, but the moment she decides to “throw her considerable influence” behind Elias is reported, not dramatized; we never see her broker-shrewdness in action under pressure. Interiority skews toward thematic summary (“strange electricity of inherited obligation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Earned stasis is credible, but the cost is stated, not felt in a micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the cycle of debt is re-weighted when Marina begins the next list—visible cost is legible. Causal chain holds: misdelivery → archives → plaque → new list. Single time-skip at midpoint is clean; orientation is anchored by word 80. Reflection blocks stay under 20 % and each cues a present-tilt action. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rooftop library, salt wind, and pulsing lighthouse beam are vivid and selective; the same glass ceiling returns to silhouette Marina’s final decision, giving the setting closure charge. Dock geography tracks cleanly across eras. Weather is used to dissolve the symphony, not just decorate. One micro-setting—the 1952 dock configuration—constrains recognition and triggers the whole quest, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“remember the forgotten without being asked”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: historical society rejections become Elias’s lived defeat; Marina’s archive access converts that defeat into public victory. The tightening is meaningful but single; no subsequent trade-off or price is dramatized on her side (no lost client, no political backlash), so cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal debt emerges through ledgers, names, and final list-making rather than explicit thesis. Final image of “cycles continuing” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Elias’s locket gesture carries more emotional charge than Marina’s articulated insight. One echo-line—“we rise on the shoulders…”—is borderline thematic statement but is grandmother-voiced, not authorial, so left intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice stays close to Marina’s perceptual filter: cargo manifests, clipboard smiles, “shrewd seaside” diction. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats and shortens during archive raid, mirroring intensity. No head-hopping; reported dialogue stays in her paraphrase, preserving distance. Filter verbs (“she thought of…”) appear but are sparse and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences frequently twin observation with action. One paraphrase loop adjacent: “the cycle continued, as cycles do” merely restates prior paragraph. Metaphors are mixed once (“sharp as barnacle-scraped steel”) yet fit maritime register. No scaffolding or simultaneity errors; closing line lands with cadence lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes the “wrong-address” trope by tying it to archival erasure of female labor; Rosa’s loading-system invention particularizes the claim. Transformation test fails—plot could survive with another misdelivered artifact—but emotional arc is inseparable from ledger/photograph dyad. Risk taken in quiet, civic closure rather than personal loss; coherence rewards the choice. No close echoes of canon scenes.</comment>
