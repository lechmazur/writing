<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s buried panic versus her hunger for open silence is embodied in every breath and micro-choice; the porcelain doll’s weight against her hip is a tactile proxy for interior pressure. The final beat—“she would grow like the crystalline vines”—crystallizes an earned shift from bunker-trained contraction to sideways, light-leaning expansion, and the cost (leaving father’s tomb unvisited) is felt without exposition. Interiority never slips into therapy-speak; instead, pulse and vertigo carry the stakes. The only drag is a slight over-recycling of “silence tasted like…” phrasing, but it never flattens the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: gravity re-normalizes, options reconfigure, and the unspoken price—her body’s memory of bunker walls—remains palpable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each silence layer, vine growth, and inversion moment thickens the texture until the final hush reweights freedom itself. Orientation is taught early; the trellis and inversion rules are learned through act and image, never dump. The only hairline slip is the late explicit tag “the original wound,” which briefly lectures what the image already shows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline vines, golden cloud-floor, and mist-woven shelters are rendered with economy—every detail either steers Mira’s body or mirrors her lung-expansion. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting: its changing heft marks accumulated silence and constrains how she grips, pockets, or presses it to her heart. Spatial choreography is flawless during inversion: we track her feet leaving platform, buds sprouting downward, the single flower opening toward clouds. The final image of vines now growing “in directions that no longer made physical sense” is charged specificity that reconfigures the world-rule itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collect the gilded hush or retreat to bunker reflex—is signaled inside 50 words and pressured by gravity inversion. One meaningful tightening occurs when she fights contraction mid-air; the inverted pull literalizes her interior tug-of-war and visibly prices her steady landing. No overt antagonist is needed; the stakes are embodied: each silence harvested makes the doll heavier and her next step riskier. Cost stays legible: she lands “steady for the first time,” proving the old panic has been paid off in breath and balance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: silence as cultivar, growth as mis-alignment with physics, freedom as weight that can be pocketed. The final line re-prices “limiting exposure” from bunker logic to vine logic—limiting fear, not world. No character spells the thesis; the flower opening toward clouds is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will she ever confront the bunker silence? That charged poise feels truer than any moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature—she clocks distances by lung capacity, color by emotional valence, gravity by how hard her pulse knocks. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer, breath-stacked clauses aloft, then staccato landing. No dialogue appears; the absence is purposeful, letting hush itself speak. Filter verbs are sparse and earned (“she felt it absorb”), never damping immediacy.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses: elastic sentences during inversion, crisp fragments on touchdown. Metaphors stay physical—“silence tasted like possibility”—and never clog high-stakes beats. One scaffold loop (“silence tasted like…”) repeats three times; each reprise adds a new flavor layer, so the pattern pays rather than dulls. Only minor paraphrase in “she had come here to collect silences / she wanted the other kinds” costs a sliver of density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The inversion-hour trellis as exposure-therapy lab feels freshly minted; no prior story fuses anti-gravity gardening with trauma silences. Risk—the physics-bending vines—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry because growth direction literalizes Mira’s internal re-orientation. Porcelain doll as silence-cargo repurposes a twee object into ontological vessel without hand-waving. Conceptual integrity holds: the world follows its reversed-gravity rule to the last image of permanent sideways sprout.</comment>
