<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s synesthetic agony is embodied and specific; her decision to turn the bolt crystallizes a hierarchy of values (song > survival) that feels earned because every earlier image—grandmother’s piano, the bellhop’s dust-letters—has charged the instrument with ancestral voice. The bellhop’s “seraphically mundane” face complicates his status as silent conspirator without slipping into label-speak; his fingertip writing distills an entire resistance into one on-page micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is pristine: synesthetic pain → discovery of REMAIN → realization that piano = voice-prison → bolt removal = breach pact; each because/therefore linkage tightens options while the fortress rule remains a persistent constraint. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the instant the bolt begins to turn, silence itself is re-priced—cost shifts from “death by storm” to “death-by-wall if caught,” a felt, legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cobalt walls that “drink snow like a bruise” and the frost-veined piano anchor every choice; the staircase dust-mark is a micro-setting that literally carries the message. Environment constrains tactics—silence is enforced by architecture—and the final image of falling snow outside while sound is about to be born inside reconfigures the stakes.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“Is silence bearable if it buys life?”—tightens through two material tests: reading the dust-word (risk of being consumed) and turning the bolt (risk of lethal storms). Each escalation is protagonist-driven; the price is visceral: Mira’s nerves fire “red and orange” behind her eyes as she pays in pain for every incremental gain toward song.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the story asks whether a life preserved by self-amputation is still alive; the answer is crystallized when Mira chooses possible death-by-sound over certain death-by-silence. The reprise of falling snow in the last line reweights the opening image—now the white blanket is no longer safety but the shroud of a living death she’s refusing.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic diction—“pain translated into colors, pressure into sound”—creates a perceptual signature that modulates under stress: shorter clauses, acoustic metaphors. No head-hopping; distance tightens from reflective awe to tactile immediacy as her fingers close on the freezing bolt, voice matching neuron-fire rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is high: one sentence slips frost, veins, piano, and generational loss into a single image. No loops; metaphor vehicles stay consistent—snow as bruise, silence as consumption. The only micro-slip is “seraphically mundane,” a coinage that risks preciousness, yet its very awkwardness fits a world where faces are wiped of expression.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The harvested-voice fortress feels freshly mythic yet mechanically explicit: silence is literal fuel, turning a familiar trope into social-physics world logic. The synesthetic protagonist plus dust-writing messenger plus piano-bolt jailbreak synthesizes into a non-obvious, inevitable whole—remove any part and the climax collapses.</comment>
