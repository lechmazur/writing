<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “weeps when she found it” and later “felt her heart hammering”—and her contradictory impulses (play softly to survive vs. swell the song to become free) act simultaneously in-scene. The micro-choice to shift from whispered dissent to full emotional resonance is earned by her months of covert practice and carries visible cost when the bridge cracks beneath her. The cicada-shell epiphany is dramatized through tactile handling and final dusting, not abstract label-speak. What keeps the score just sub-9 is a trace of safety-hedging: her smile at the end is slightly too tidy, a micro beat of perfect emotional calibration that softens the flaw-cost we’ve watched accumulate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the upward-falling blossoms rewire the orchard’s gravity of control, and the cost is legible in the cracked bridge and the crumbled shell. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via heartbeat code, blossom inversion, statue fracture—until the final image crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The persistent constraint (soft-volume survival) shapes every tactic and is finally shed on-page, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sky-bridge itself functions as micro-setting: its “silvered planks” constrain Mira’s movement and literally splinter under the final resonance, charging the closure image. The enchanted orchard’s rules are learned through action—statues climb, dust patterns shift—never dumped. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: she notices “rotting fruit and frost” because survival depends on weathering the night. Only the brief “manicured hell” phrase edges toward symbolic shout, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal freedom vs. mechanized beauty—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the statue begins climbing. The meaningful deepening occurs at the cicada-shell realization: the option to “become too vast” replaces the earlier binary of whisper vs. shout, foreclosing recalibration. Cost is visible—bridge cracks, shell crumbles—under the Accumulative lens. Agency is interior yet decisive: the choice to swell feeling rather than volume is hers, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific inversion of organic vs. mechanical beauty rather than explicit thesis. The upward-falling blossoms act as non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext pulses in the silence between heartbeats and the statue’s 3-degree turn. The final image resists tidy moral—it offers wonder laced with fracture—meeting the 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “silvered by decades of neglect” shows textured diction without purple drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira filters world through sound, silence, pulse. Compression such as “tarnished wonder of it all” is purposeful, taught early and reprised at closure. One minor register wobble: “conceptual repricing” is an academic phrase that momentarily leaks evaluator lexicon into narrative, holding the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—lines simultaneously advance atmosphere, stakes, and tactile detail: “apple blossoms began falling upward” performs image, theme, and causal result. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato heartbeat triplets without drumbeat monotony. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than repeating. Only the single “manicured hell” cliché prevents a 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The heartbeat-code revolt against sound-policing statues is a fresh synthesis of bio-resistance + bureaucratic dystopia, made specific through violin acoustics and cicada molting. Risk is taken—upward-falling blossoms risk whimsy—but earns thematic coherence because the inversion was seeded by the shell’s empty husk. The transformation test passes: swap violin/pulse for any other quiet rebellion and the emotional engine collapses. +0.3 risk bonus applied for blossom inversion that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
