<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren’s occupation-driven perceptual signature is vivid—ink under nails, frost as text—but her interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“perfect systems were prisons”). The final micro-choice (pulling the lever) is telegraphed rather than wrestled with; we see no contradictory impulse in scene, so the renunciation feels pre-decided. Still, her hierarchy of values (imperfection > eternity) is legible and pays a visible cost when the press dissolves into light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns → bottled whisper → library’s laughter form a density wave that reweights the stake from stasis to descent. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystalline architecture cracks, the library exhales, and the page-snow reseeds reality—cost is felt in the simultaneous loss of perfection and Maren’s press. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but each image accretes meaning without contradiction; the final image of “slow descent” crystallizes the new grammar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass orchard is not postcard backdrop: transparent branches heavy with books physically constrain movement and supply the only “fruit” Maren can harvest for meaning. Frost fractals function as both oracle and tool—she must read without melting them—so environment directly shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: east wing, composing stone, spiraling clouds tighten into a vortex that pulls the library down. The micro-setting of the press dissolving into light charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library’s perfect stasis vs. awakened change—is signaled in paragraph three (“Perfect systems… afraid to change”) and tightens through the frost’s rupture pattern. One meaningful deepening: the whisper’s release escalates from abstract threat to literal crack propagating through glass. Cost is visible—Maren loses her press and the library loses lift—yet the price feels slightly diffuse because the library, not Maren, pays the larger freight. Still, agency is hers alone and the escalation is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: imperfection as life’s prerequisite. The motif of frost-as-text reweights at closure when cracks become the new alphabet. Subtext in the whisper’s “stellar death and birth” reframes entropy as creative. No moralizing; the final image of page-snow seeding forgotten ground offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The avoidance of explicit thesis keeps the score below 9, but the complexity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly anchored to Maren’s perceptual filter—ink-stained fingers, glass hum, frost dialect—without drifting into omniscient tourism. Syntax elongates in contemplative beats, then compresses during the lever pull: “She pulled the lever. The whisper exploded…” mirroring her pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the diction stays within a printer’s plausible lexicon (“composing stone,” “lead type”). The rhythmic drop into fragmentary awe at the end (“laughed. The sound was crystal chimes…”) is earned and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with the frost’s crystalline swell and the final shatter. Information density is high—“bottled whisper, harvested from the last words of a dying star” packs world, trade, and myth into one clause. Metaphor stack is controlled: each glass image refracts light differently, avoiding self-contradiction. Minor scaffold: “perfect systems… afraid to change” is abstract synopsis that could have been dramatized through a single stalled patron encounter; this keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Risk-taking is bold yet coherent: a floating library that fruits books, frost as oracle, and a stellar whisper as printing ink synthesize into an inevitable metaphor for narrative entropy. The inversion—perfection as prison, rupture as salvation—feels fresh because it is grounded in tactile detail (ink, type, glass splinters). Transformation test fails if names are swapped: the glass orchard, letterpress, and frost-language are irreplaceable. The descent into an imperfect world is a genuine conceptual repricing rather than a twist, earning the high-band bonus.</comment>
