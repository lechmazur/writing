<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s survivor-guilt and need to “write” the dead into marble is palpable; the contradiction between monetizing trauma and honoring it drives every beat. The carving/setting-down of named pawns externalizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is specific—footsteps as alphabet, camp-muscle memory, refusal to speak aloud—never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling. Micro-choice in the final paragraph (she places her own name last) earns the renunciation of crisis-actor life without tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each circuit of the gallery thickens the density of memory until the restored pawns reweight the chessboard from symbol of erasure to memorial. Orientation locked by sentence 5; no causality breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: the board is “made whole and strange,” a CR that conceptually reprices the monarchy’s original erasure. Cost is legible—she walks out of paid purgatory into unfinanced witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whispering-gallery acoustic and missing-pawn chessboard are not backdrop but instruments: the dome’s scatter of sun-fragments constrains where she stands to whisper, the pawn-less squares literally forbid conventional play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footstep alphabet, acoustic focus points, marble table center—every move tracked. Sensory hierarchy obeys camp-honed attention: sound and touch (footfalls, carved wood) override visual spectacle. The final image of restored pawns on alien board crystallizes setting as memorial tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she keep monetizing trauma or risk unpaid remembrance? Pressure escalates by accretion: each empty month, each drill, each walked name layers weight until the single micro-turn—she carves herself a pawn and sets it down. No antagonist needed; the council’s silence and her own economic precarity supply coherent force. Cost is visible: she forfeits the “invaluable” paycheck and embraces the gallery’s unpaid silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of expendability: pawns deleted by kings become the only pieces that matter. Subtext lives in gesture—footsteps as writing, teacup angle as revolt—never sermonizing. Final image answers the thematic question: remembrance is not a luxury add-on but the game’s true completion. Complexity intact—she exits toward poverty, not triumph—avoiding moral neatness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight inside Vera’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Syntax lengthens and compresses with her walking rhythm, mirroring camp-metric cadence. Diction—“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless”—remains within lexicon of a multilingual survivor who has rehearsed official euphemisms. Free indirect (“She called it purgatory”) fuses narrator and character judgment cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with circling motion; sentence length varies from staccato footfall beats to longer accumulative clauses. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors are sparse, precise—“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”—each reappears to reweight meaning at closure. Zero filter-verb stacks; every clause advances memory-density or physical action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of crisis-actor profession with whisper-gallery memorial is non-obvious and internally coherent. Walking-as-writing re-tools a familiar spatial motif (acoustic arch) into archive. Missing-pawn chessboard transformed from power metaphor to anti-monument delivers fresh repricing. Risk taken—quiet ending, no crowned king—yet resonance lands because the charged image is earned.</comment>
