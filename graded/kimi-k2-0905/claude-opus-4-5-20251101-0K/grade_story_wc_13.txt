<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam’s interior contradiction—scientist’s caution versus grief-driven time-debt—drives every beat; the borrowed-months cost is felt in her trembling hands. Micro-choices (touching the cage, sitting exhausted) are embodied, not labeled. Final endurance (sketching the cadence) is earned by the prior causal chain of borrowing, uncaging, and hearing the echo. Voice remains individual, though “time is a loop” edges label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed echo lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—her unknown truncated lifespan—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The interrupted-cadence motif tightens across every beat, re-weighted in the final sketch image. Causality holds: pendant → borrow → cage dissolution → echo return. Orientation is clean; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and reinforced by body-in-courtyard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is not backdrop; its gravity-defying water guides Miriam’s footing and signals Aldros’s sleep-state, determining when echoes can be freed. The crystallized-sound cage is a micro-setting that physically constrains her final action. Infinity pendant as recurring object heats/changes state, charging the last image. Sensory hierarchy is illustrator-specific—line-weight of light, “feathered impressions”—never tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the world’s lost completions by risking personal time-bankruptcy. Escalation is textural: each borrowed pulse heats the pendant, density of unpaid time grows until the courtyard release reweights the stake—she wins world-cadence, loses unknown years. No coincidence; her agency alone uncages. Cost is legible: “she did not know how much time she had left.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: every fossil, every trapped echo, every borrowed second insists that incompleteness is a violence. Final image—drawing the completed cadence—offers resonant, non-literal answer: art can repay time’s debt. No moralizing; the insight is earned through bodily cost. Ambiguity lingers: peace or exhaustion? Reader left to decide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tight: fossil-drawer’s eye notices “spiraling shells,” “feathered impressions,” then “shape of a completed cadence.” Rhythm accelerates with stacked clauses during cage release, then fractures into exhausted brevity. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Prose texture mirrors illustrator’s precision—lines etched, then fluid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from sinuous canal sentences to staccato release. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory cue, emotional state, and world rule. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Interrupted cadence” refrain is purposeful pattern, not artifact. Minor elevation in “time is a loop” but paid off immediately in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: paleontology + time-debt + acoustic cage + sleeping mountain-giant feels inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—borrowing against one’s own future—pays off in conceptual cost rather than neat victory. Details are irreplaceable: gravity-spiraling canal water, sound-turned-crystal bars. No genre templates; transformation complete.</comment>
