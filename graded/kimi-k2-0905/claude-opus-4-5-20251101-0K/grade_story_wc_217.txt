<comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrical and embodied—her grandmother’s “woven dawns” memory feels lived-in, and her choice to weave the kite with the torn feather is a micro-choice that costs her the purity of her solitude. The boy’s minimal interiority is acceptable for his age, but his sudden dignity-switch reads slightly performative. Overall, the flaws are cosmetic; the earned asymmetry of the final image satisfies the closure cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the kite’s wobble then steady climb reweights the “incomplete” motif with visible cost—the feather’s torn barb glints as it ascends, foreclosing a return to unblemished beauty. Causality is accumulative: each fragment (rain-stopped lagoon, found feather, snapped kite) layers texture until pattern crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens holds without ambiguity. No orientation or lens cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lagoon mirror and the feather’s iridescence are not postcard prettiness—they constrain Mira’s attention and later become the literal material of the kite’s repair, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a poet notices “burnished hush” and kelp twist before practicality. Micro-setting (the feather as tool) meets 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “burnished hush” edges toward thesaurus drift, but cadence justifies it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty discovered in incompleteness—tightens once when Mira must decide whether to hoard or gift the flawed feather. The boy’s disappointment supplies external pressure, but the escalation is textural (pattern accretion) rather than causal narrowing; options don’t narrow so much as deepen. Cost is present but soft—she gives away solitude, yet the price is felt more than declared. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but not quite the visible-forfeit that would push 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the feather-kite fusion; no character sermonizes “imperfection is beautiful.” Final image reconfigures the grandmother’s proverb without repeating it—quiet, resonant, non-literal. Ambiguity is purposeful: the boy’s laugh could be relief or new wonder, letting readers supply weight. Avoids moralizing; only minor deduction for “sometimes different carries its own kind of flight” edging toward prompt-echo, but it’s spoken in-scene and feels child-appropriate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, poet-tinged diction (“cobalt lagoon,” “woven dawns”) filtered through Mira’s perceptual lens without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences post-storm tighten into clipped kite-repair motions. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is coherent—no mixed vehicles. Dialogue is sparse, natural, kid-authentic. Meets 9+ quick test; only hairline restraint from 9.0 is one “burnished hush” that flirts with preciousness, but cadence earns it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with lagoon-paced rhythm, then shorten during repair; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 700+ words, each purposeful. One near-scaffold: “surface holding the sky like polished glass” could collapse into cliché, but it’s immediately complicated by droplet interference. Information density high; each detail later recurs (kelp, feather asymmetry, ink smudge). Minor -0.2 for “burnished hush” register flirtation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Freshness lies in the synthesis: poet + flawed feather + child’s kite = quiet accumulative epiphany rather than triumphant recovery. Risk is low—but appropriate to meditative mode. “Woven dawns” as cosmology rather than decoration lifts it above familiar “beauty in brokenness” templates. Could swap lagoon for any shoreline, so setting specificity isn’t irreplaceable, but the feather-kite fusion is idiosyncratic enough to feel particular.</comment>
