<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s fear-of-enclosed-spaces is the motor for every beat: she descends because of it, stays sharp because of it, and the final ascent is legibly harder because terror has taxed her body. The micro-choice to speak the names aloud is the earned, costly turn that forecloses her own emotional escape hatch. One hairline slip: “I see you” drifts toward therapeutic self-labeling, but the embodied cost of the ascent keeps the score sub-9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira surfaces with the codex, but the true gain is the list of names she will carry; the ocean’s “endless hush” makes the cost audible. Causal lattice holds—every body found is a because/therefore payoff to the cable hunt. One tiny orientation waver: “twelve hours between one tidal change and the next” is dropped before we know we’re underwater, but the later image of the tidal window reimburses the debt.</comment>

<comment>Environment, body, and tool trinity: the elevator shaft constrains the initial descent, the flooded corridor dictates slow-motion choreography, the codex’s gold flecks catch the final light to charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Mira’s claustrophobic perception—ceiling “barnacled” is felt as impending suffocation, not scenery. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the codex functions as portable, pressure-sealed “room” whose cracking is a spatial beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—remember the dead before the tidal gate closes—tightens twice: first when the codex is found (now she must carry it out) and again when the ascent burns her muscles. Each body encountered is a visible price that depletes air and time, altering later tactics (she photographs faster, breathes harder). Cost is legible on the page; the final image of the humming modern cables shows the world has moved on while she is still paying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as an act of bearing weight. The undersea cables—once severed, now humming anew—reprice the idea of connection: the living stay connected by forgetting, the dead by being named. Gold flecks and phase-transition science form a quiet metaphor for states of remembrance (buried → surfaced). No moralizing, only the crystalline final image of her writing against the ocean’s hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, ocean-pressurized: “color of weak tea,” “drowned cathedral.” Perceptual signature is claustrophobic—every noun is felt as surface or threat. Rhythm modulates with depth: short, hammered clauses during ascent mirror muscle burn. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the speculative diction (“electromagnetic ghosts”) stays within Mira’s professional lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one line carries setting, metaphor, and emotional charge—“the crashing hush of the deep pressed against her suit, that particular silence that wasn’t silence at all but the weight of an ocean holding its breath.” No looped stems, no mixed metaphors. One near-artifact: “water moved through phase transitions of its own down here” skirts editorializing, but the scientific frame justifies the conceit and it pays off in the codex image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—haunted underwater lab, last logbook—are re-forged through Mira’s terror-as-instrument: she is a spelunker who spelunks her own panic. The gold-illuminated codex is a fresh infusion of medieval monk reverence into cold-science apocalypse. Risk taken: quiet ending is a list of names, yet the oceanic hush reweights modernity’s amnesia; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
