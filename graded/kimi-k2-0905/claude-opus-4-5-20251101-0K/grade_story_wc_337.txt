<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and character-specific—her trembling fingers, the way silence “accumulates like dust” inside her. The micro-choice to unravel rather than mend crystallizes her contradiction and drives the plot. The final beat heals her hands through action, not miracle, earning the change. No stock therapy-speak; even the meta-line “I broke things I cannot fix” is grounded in porcelain shards we have seen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s hands steady as she chooses visible cracks and gold stitching, a visible cost that reconfigures her vocation. The causal chain—shattered masks → silence accrued → net-unravelling as exchange economy → steady hands—remains intact under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of “interlaced hush” inside her chest is the charged poise that makes the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not scenery; its refracting walls literally scatter starlight into the colors that mirror the confessions being released. The tapestry needle’s worn silver and the net’s salt-crusted knots are tactile, lived-in tools. Spatial choreography holds as Mira moves from altar-center to departing at dawn, objects tracked without drift. The micro-setting of her own body—hands steadying—constrains the final image and qualifies for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she trade her silence for theirs—tightens when each loosened knot releases an actual voice, narrowing her ethical option to keep listening. The cost accumulates: every confession she frees etches Callum softer while feeding her own steadiness. Agency is continuous: she chooses to keep unravelling even after hearing the worst secrets. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length and is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of restoration—honesty lies in fracture, not seamlessness—without a sermon. The image of cracked masks stitched with gold reframes Japanese kintsugi into a moral stance: visible damage as legitimacy. No character articulates the thesis; even Callum’s suggestion “You could restore them now” is an offer, not a moral. The final emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the hush inside Mira as peace rather than punishment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her tactile focus—verbs like “threaded,” “loosened,” “gathered”—creating a rhythmic needle-and-thread pulse. The diction keeps within her artisan lexicon: “lacquer,” “porcelain,” “knots.” Filter verbs are avoided; when they appear (“she understood”) they coincide with micro-choice, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; short sentences under starlight, longer coils inside the net’s secrets. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—starlight as “quiet wounds” teaches the pattern of light-as-injury that culminates in the final ray catching the needle. No mixed metaphors or loops; each image advances either atmosphere or knowledge. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stake without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kintsugi-restorer who mends by unraveling is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist here. The economy of trading silences with ghosts turns a sentimental premise into a concrete bargaining table. Risk—making the protagonist’s healing contingent on destroying others’ knots—pays off without violating internal logic. Specificity of the salt-net’s three-century age and the prism sanctuary’s physics keeps the fantastical grounded.</comment>
