<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s stoic fisher temperament is vividly embodied—her stillness under the fountain’s resonance, the micro-choice to “release nothing.” The rail-spike heartbeat spirals give concrete interiority, and her silent offering shows contradictory impulses (grief vs. composure) active in-scene. Cost is legible: the echo she gains forecloses the splinter of not-knowing, re-weighting her future nets. Interiority never slips into label-speak; every beat is filtered through a fisher’s patience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the goddess’s whisper re-weights water, stars, and Maren’s vocation in one bone-set line. Causality holds—stillness earned at sea enables the silence that calls the echo; spike translates cost in visible amber grief. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (boots on humming gravel). No teleporting props; zigzag path straightens under cosmic signal, tightening options exactly once. Cost is unmistakable: “I was trying to reach a star” re-prices every future cast of her net.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is no postcard: gravel hums under weight, fountain of resonance spirals upward, constellations drift in measurable defiance of charts. Sensory hierarchy respects a fisher’s ear for vibration; crystallized hedges and iron spike ground the surreal rules early. Micro-setting works—spike becomes the portable constraint that charges the final image with matching constellation patterns. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves as path curves into unprocessable geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hear the drowned daughter’s last words—is signaled in graf 4 and tightened once: silence is the only remaining option. Agency is renunciation rather than assault; by voicing nothing Maren forecloses blame and accepts release. Pressure is situational but coherent—garden, goddess, and constellates each amplify the cost of not-knowing. No coincidence resolves; the echo arrives as direct consequence of her silence, leaving her changed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: parental guilt vs. cosmic indifference, reframed when the child claims agency (“I was trying to reach a star”). The feral-lullaby tone and sleepwalking stars keep meaning unstable until the final re-pricing lands. No moral is stated; the nets-turned-telescopes image invites lingering counter-readings. Subtext resides in spike-colors and constellation drift, never explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Maren’s perceptual bias—she catalogs by texture, weight, vibration, not adjectives. Syntax lengthens during stillness, fragments under fountain pressure; rhythm mirrors fisher patience vs. bone-level shock. No head-hopping; goddess voice is rendered as chord, not interiority. Diction stays within a coastal worker’s lexicon until “conceptual” finale, justified by cosmic re-pricing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “splinter working its way toward her heart” does triple metaphorical, tactile, and stakes work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors are functional—feral lullaby, mother wolf—because the frame is mythic. One register spike (“conceptual repricing” in narrative tag) is forgiven because closure beat is emotional, not academic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines sound-garden, emotion-spike, and sleepwalking stars into a fresh after-death visitation myth; none feel grafted. Transformation test fails if Maren isn’t a fisher—nets-to-stars payoff is occupation-specific. Risky silence-as-weapon avoids typical bargain scene. Familiar grieving-parent trope is inverted: child wanted the sky, parent must fish it.</comment>
