<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is cleanly legible—complete her grandmother’s archival work—yet interiority stays at a lyrical remove (“something she could not name”). Embodied emotion is strongest when she hesitates before the lens fragment, a micro-choice that crystallizes inheritance as duty. The final assent to “her true work” reads as earned renunciation of an ordinary life. More contradiction inside individual beats would push this to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each stall and painting adds density to the erased-history pattern until the hidden stitch is revealed. The lighthouse lens fragment acts as the charged poise beat—its light reweights the city’s visible/ invisible strata. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: she now sees the ghost layers she must spend her life translating. The thirty-year wait pays off grandmother’s set-up without talkiness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Phosphorescent lanterns, swaying cables, and bottled memories compress market otherworldliness into sensory shorthand. The body-as-setting appears when numb fingers on the rope ladder filter the aerial choreography. The fragment itself is micro-setting that finally reframes the city’s strata—an object whose physical property alters perception. Occasional stock phrasing (“amber and shadow”) keeps this from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lens to continue the grandmaternal counter-archive—tightens once: the fragment is either sewn behind the painting or lost forever. Escalation is textural: each painting card thickens the pattern of hidden records until Mira’s recognition yields the single irrevocable choice. Cost is felt immediately: she sees the multilayered city she can never again unsee. A second pressure turn would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of archival rescue emerges through concrete images—stitched fragment, reflection in the keeper’s window—never thesis taglines. Subtext operates in the vendor’s half-smile and the spider-silk thread, implying generations of quiet conspiracy. Final image reconfigures ancestor work as living translation, not nostalgic fetish. Keeps 9 at bay because “anchors of intuition” edges toward aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Mira’s synesthetic perception (“neither touch nor sight but something between”). Syntax elongates then compresses in sync with swaying platforms, creating rhythmic propulsion. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads cracks as names, starlight as bottled cargo. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience (“official records erased”) but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is高密度: “bottled memories, pressed starlight, tinctures of forgotten names” triple-loads without syntactic clutter. Metaphors stay coherent (market pages translucent, light bent into nameless colors). Occasional qualifier stack (“elusively tangible sensation”) faintly softens impact. Read-aloud rhythm pulses—long breath, then short clutch—mirroring rope-ladder ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Floating market of erased histories feels fresh yet inevitable, remixing familiar tropes (night bazaar, steampunk aerial) into archival ghost-epistemology. Grandmother-to-granddaughter lens quest avoids chosen-one cliché by framing inheritance as tedious lifelong translation. Risk: lyric ellision could have curdled into abstraction, but specificity of stitched fragment keeps it grounded. Slight minus for echo of “Great Forgetting” subgenre shorthand.</comment>
