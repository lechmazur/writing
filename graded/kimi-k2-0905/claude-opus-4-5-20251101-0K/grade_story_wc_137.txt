<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her bone-deep vibration from whale song and the “smell of their mother’s garden after rain” flash are embodied. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. desperate hope) play simultaneously in scene, not summary. The final micro-choice—descend with journal pressed to heart—crystallizes her value hierarchy and earned endurance. Minor slip: “sympathetic skeptic” is declared once rather than dramatized through prior action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the journal’s seventeen pages of symbols reweight the premise, making the cost of refusal visible. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each starlit tile, whale note, and ink stroke accumulates until the final image reconfigures meaning. The tower’s purpose reframed as “sculpting space” delivers conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tower’s circular roof opening, star-refracting tile, and whale-borne vibrations constrain attention and later choice. Micro-setting objects (tea tasting of honey and “something unnamed,” worn pen) are handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography clean: Mira sits, watches tiles, writes, descends. Environment mirrors internal state—starlight “danced across the journal’s blank pages” without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sister’s memories—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the tile’s refracted starlight forces transcription, narrowing options from passive observation to irreversible act. Cost is legible—Mira’s tears and the “impossible hope” she now carries. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lyric design; no reversal, but deepening intensifies emotional price.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: entanglement as both quantum and familial, whales as forgotten architects of memory. Subtext in Aldric’s “old grief, transformed by time into gentle purpose” reframes healing as service rather than cure. Final image of “impossible hope” laid at sister’s feet avoids moralizing. Ambiguity—will transcription work?—lingers without confusion, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: whale songs “settle into bones,” starlight “danced across blank pages.” Syntax lengthens during transcendent beats, shortens at decision (“She descended”). No dialogue to distort voice. Free-indirect style clean: “She understood suddenly…” maintains psychic distance. Minor register lift—“quantum threads”—is justified by Aldric’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “Tears fell onto the page, but Mira kept writing” advances action, embodies emotion, tightens rhythm. No scaffold loops; only two near-paraphrases (“skeptical of everything…skeptical of this place”) serve thematic emphasis. Figurative language stays coherent—whales “sculpting space,” starlight “refracted into shapes.” Final line varies cadence, anchoring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: whale-song as mnemonic catalyst + antique magic-square astronomy + quantum entanglement feels inevitable, not grafted. Risks lyric accumulative structure over causal plot; payoff justifies choice. Avoids stock “memory theft” cliché by making transcription an act of shared creation. Could edge higher if whale-migration rule had constrained tactics more explicitly.</comment>
