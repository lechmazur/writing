<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Aldric’s interiority is vivid—armor dropping beat-by-beat embodies surrender—but the turn from doubt to vesselhood is declared more than dramatized; the blank-program page erase feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each glowing fruit / pattern repetition deepens the stake until the star-birth image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: empty-handed knight becomes conduit, cost legible in irrevocable “withdrawn-but-present” stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse’s glassy void and phosphor fruit function as micro-setting that constrains the final release—armor must fall silently or disturb the breathing dark. Sensory triangulation (loam, humidity, ringing laugh) grounds the cosmic rupture without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“possibility vs certainty”—is signaled early; the unsnapping sequence tightens it by foreclosing martial identity. Cost (vulnerability under glowing web) is visible, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; one extra friction beat could sharpen the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of relinquishing control to allow new creation emerges through recurring string/web imagery rather than statement. Final starbirth re-prices the seven-year night without moralizing, though the puppet-queen cover is under-leveraged for ironic counterpoint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; syntax tilts toward liturgical cadence that suits the numinous turn. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“darkness seemed to breathe”) is character-bound and pays off in the healed-sky image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variety and high-density lines (“each piece fall to the earth with a muffled thud”) propel the surrender. Occasional elevated diction (“phosphorescence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift but never clots the climactic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of withdrawn knight, alchemical orchard, and marionette metaphors feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable; trope of fallen paladin is refreshed through cosmic horticulture rather than battlefield. Risk in cosmic scope is balanced by micro tactile choices.</comment>
