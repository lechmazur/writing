<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—philosopher vs. forest-healer—is dramatized in the moment she palms the worn gear; the embodied tremor in her joints links displacement to vocation. Her micro-choice to surrender the talisman carries visible cost (no backup gear, no safety suppressants) and crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The flaw: her “wild frontier” motive is stated once in abstract shorthand; we get no second beat that tests or complicates it under rising pressure. Still, the gear-in-tree beat earns a credible endurance/renunciation close to Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bronze sequoia’s pure note reconfigures Mira’s neural map with undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep translocating without buffer. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (single sustained note) reweights the dominant stake. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (“translocated again”) pays off at closure. Minor causality gap: the tree’s dying state is intuited instantly with no cue, but the false note is forgivable under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mechanical rainforest is evoked through metal’s sensory palette—brass heartbeat, velvet pistons, copper gossip—each detail filtered by Mira’s philosophical ear. The gear-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: only its aperture fits, fusing tool and world. Spatial choreography stays clean across the one move (palm-trunk, access-panel, swap). The “perpetual twilight” sky is generic filler, preventing 9-band, but every noun after that earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—pursuit of insight via unbuffered straying—tightens when she risks her last talisman to save a dying consciousness. Agency is accumulative: her attention (listening) → micro-choice (swap gear) → irreversible cost (no suppressant safety, no talisman). Price is legible on-page: “the tree would live. She had unraveled another boundary.” One-step escalation suffices for lyric short form; the tightening forecloses return to academic detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the identity of straying and discipline—insight as migratory vulnerability rather than doctrine. No overt thesis statement; the final image (copper forests beyond horizon) reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in object: gear once powered academic certainty, now powers organic-mechanical hybrid, repricing knowledge as mutual maintenance. Ambiguity lingers: is she prophet or seed? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensorium; perceptual signature is acoustic-philosophical—“hum of insight,” “minor keys,” “gossip in frequencies.” Syntax flexes from pastoral calm to clockwork diction without register drift. No dialogue, so no voice-contamination risk. Compressed diction under stress (“For a moment, nothing happened.”) mirrors cardiac pause before revelation. Consistent interior idiom anchors lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and hard cadence breaks, matching wind-music motif. High information density: one line can world-build, characterize, and foreshadow (“Each species of mechanical flora produced its own voice.”). No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor scaffolding: “seventeen years” is off-page summary, but it’s compressed in opener and never repeated. Closure line is taut and image-only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of rainforest biome with sentient clockwork ecology feels inevitable post-Awakening, yet rarely seen in short form. The “hum of insight” converts epistemology into auditory ecology—fresh inflection that grows from character need rather than gimmick. Risk in lyric non-linear structure is fully paid off by resonant final image. Transformation test fails: gear-swap could not swap with any generic token; same for philosopher-healer archetype welded to translocating penalty. Bold, specific, memorable.</comment>
