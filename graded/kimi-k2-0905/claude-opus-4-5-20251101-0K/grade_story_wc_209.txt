<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—her chest-carried “stone” and pre-dawn vigils give us embodied want. The contradiction between public acclaim and private incompleteness stays active; each return to the pavilion is a micro-choice that costs sleep and ego. Closure beats echo this: she keeps adding strangers to the wall, renouncing solitude, paying with perpetual return. Only flaw: the grandmother’s insomnia is told post-fact, so the bidirectional hereditary drive is slightly inferred rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered glass images, postcard echoes, and mural coats build density until the final “midnight congregation” reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—inside 50 words we have who (Mira), where (amber pavilion), when (last snow melting). The meaningful tightening happens at the fourth glass layer—human figure replaces bloom, forcing her pivot from observation to gift-making. Cost is visible: annual returns, perpetual additions, the pavilion forever open to others’ grief—she trades private answer for public stewardship.</comment>

<comment>Honey-colored panes, copper light, and etched seed-to-figure sequence are concrete and motive—glass strata literally direct her brush. Weather shift from melting snow to spring bypasses cliché by syncing with mural completion, not mere seasonal marker. Micro-setting dominates: the cathedral-layer window constrains her final insight and later governs visitor ritual, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies or impossible sight-lines.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—answering “why darkness?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when mural palette shifts to blue-charcoal, committing her to serve the sleepless. Each postcard reread and dawn vigil costs time and emotional labor, price legible in “quietly driven” repetition. No coincidence; escalation is her escalating gift—first study, then paint, then perpetual welcome. Final image of strangers recognizing themselves is earned stasis with undeniable social cost: her privacy gone, pavilion now communal shrine.</comment>

<grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges through image, not sermon: darkness as clientele, blooms as love letters to the overlooked. Subtext lives in silent gallery visits—no dialogue needed. Final mural tableau answers the grandmother’s question wordlessly, achieving CR. Ambiguity survives: is Mira fulfilled or indentured? That counter-reading lingers, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical close-third stays steady; no POV leakage. Perceptual signature—light rendered as copper, snow as silver stream—matches painter’s eye. Compression such as “dawning hush became her teacher” is taught by repetition of pre-sun vigils and pays off in mural consecration. Sentence rhythm rises and falls like breath, matching hush-to-bloom tempo; no syntactic monotony.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“amber pavilion,” “honey-colored panes,” “copper light” tri-loads visual data in six words without clutter. Metaphors stay coherent (darkness as clientele, not mixed). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or motive. Punctuation and tense immaculate. Only micro-slip: “quietly driven” phrase repeated thrice; costs −0.1, still within high band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cathedral optics, botanical night ecology, and insomnia-as-ministry feels fresh and specific; not a trope remix seen elsewhere. Risk taken: a climax of adding portraits of strangers rather than grand gesture; payoff is communal resonance, not personal triumph. Conceptual integrity tight—every layer of glass, paint, or snow follows the same logic of “reveal for the overlooked.” Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
