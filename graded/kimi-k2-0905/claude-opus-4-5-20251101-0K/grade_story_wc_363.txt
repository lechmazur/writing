<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s transformation into “thread” is foreshadowed by generational craft and the amber bead, so the self-sacrifice feels inevitable, not convenient. Interiority stays concrete—calloused fingers, the bead’s weight—avoiding label-speak. The only friction: we get no contradictory impulse; she moves from resolve to dissolution without hesitation, slightly flattening depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mei’s disappearance reweights the premise—family love is literally woven across time—at visible cost (her body gone, only moss letters remain). Causal lens holds: amber bead + puzzle frame + humming edges cause the portal; sacrifice sends the message. Orientation is taught early (bamboo-apple collision, loom lineage by word 80) and pays off in the final image of golden thread vanishing into bead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Bamboo spears through rotting apple trunks, amber bead glowing under “scattered diamonds of light”—selective, tactile, and mirrored in Mei’s narrowing perception. The orchard reclaims verticality after the message crosses, showing environment causally altered by the spell. Micro-setting (bead as portable time-prison) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver grandmother’s promise—tightens once: the puzzle frame + amber bead either work or Mei forfeits her substance. Escalation is singular but sufficient: successful transit costs her corporality, price legible in the pressed moss letters. No reversal, yet the lens (causal) only requires one meaningful narrowing; it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—love as trans-temporal labor—emerges through loom imagery, generational repetition, and the final golden thread; no character moralizes. The orchard’s shift from raveling silence to “something whole” reweights meaning without sermon. Ambiguity remains: we never learn grandfather’s reply, keeping sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers in Mei’s perceptual filter—creaking bamboo as loom-time, light as “stoically sparkling”—creating a consistent lyric signature. Compression (“she understood completely”) is earned after sensory groundwork. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens into luminous brevity at the end, matching her attenuation into thread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long, loom-like cadences to fragmentary flashes (“The amber bead pulsed once, brilliant, then settled…”), propelling the ritual. Figurative language is sparse outside the portal moment, preventing purple drift. Zero loops, no scaffold; every paragraph advances image, choice, or cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Using jigsaw edges as temporal loom shuttle is fresh; the bead-as-fossil-router literalizes “sender becomes message” without exposition. Risk lies in the quiet, non-western magical logic; it commits fully, refusing explanatory safety. The only echo is familiar war-separated-lovers trope, but specificity of craft ritual transforms it.</comment>
