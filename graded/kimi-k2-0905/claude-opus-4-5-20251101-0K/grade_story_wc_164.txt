<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief vs wonder, need to know vs need to accept—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (pressing seeds to glass, planting them). The final renunciation lands because the text has tied her identity as recollectionist to the act of transliterating her own grief; cost is visible in the laugh-cry echo. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Flaw: the sister remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is theoretical, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of transliteration → seed conjecture → transliteration re-weighted. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira plants seeds while holding the glass, crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the permanent not-finding. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). No causal break; every beat adds density or cadence shift. Minor slack: the bird vector is late-revealed, not seeded earlier, a hairline nick in pattern coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode is not backdrop but tool: crystal crevices accept seeds, light scatters tears, walls pulse—environment directly enables the final act. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s priorities (touch > sight) under time pressure. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies. The cave’s glow constrains her visibility yet offers moisture pockets—setting shapes tactics. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find why paths disappear before memory dissolves”—is signaled early and tightens via the 3-day clock. One meaningful deepening: seeds force reinterpretation of sister’s resignation, foreclosing the old investigative path. Cost legible: she forfeits certainty and the possibility of future search. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, fitting the lens; sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: transliteration of emotion → transliteration of grief into garden-of-light. Final image reweights “missing pieces” as transformed, not lost—conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext resides in the seeds’ impossible journey, echoing the sister’s unknowable transit. Ambiguity lingers: Mira may still be wrong, yet the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—selective attention to texture, color, moisture. Syntax mirrors her recursive thinking: long accumulative sentences for transliteration, staccato fragments when seeds are noticed. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within her lexicon (“transliterates,” “sea-foam”) without forced lyricism. Meets 9+ gate: distinct rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (light/memory/glass) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “crystal” and “light” repeat in adjacent lines mid-story (−0.2). Closure line is clean, propulsive. No filter-verb clusters. Overall rhythm breathes with escalating beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—“recollectionist who converts emotion into readable pattern”—is fresh yet immediately intelligible. Seeds as displaced path is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable after the transliteration setup. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without obscuring stakes. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming specificity. Minor deduction for echo of “paths disappear” trope, here reanimated through craft.</comment>
