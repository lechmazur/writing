<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margaret’s contradictory impulses—bridge-song caretaker vs. latent photographer—are dramatized in the glass-flake beat and the final step onto the hidden trail; the cost of abandoning her 40-year identity is felt in the laugh that escapes “like a bridge-song played on an instrument of pure air.” Interiority stays concrete, but a few phrases (“luminous disbelief,” “radical acceptance”) flirt with label-speak, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the Decisive Change is Margaret’s first physical step off the pullout onto the impossible trail, glass flake warm in palm—an irreversible fork with visible forfeit of her bridge life. Causal chain (question → gift → map → step) holds; scaffold-wrap map is taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the laugh that severs her from the bridge, capping the arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The mountain pullout, aspens, and wind-whipped scaffold wrap are filtered through Margaret’s musician-eye: sound of snapping plastic, morning light “thicker than physics should allow,” trail she “somehow recognized.” Micro-setting (glass flake) literally reframes what can be seen and thus what can be chosen, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. One tiny slip: “federal forestland” is told, not shown through signage or boundary cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the abandoned photographic life—tightens once: the map stabilizes only through the flake, forcing the choice to leave the bridge. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 700 words; the step onto the trail forecloses the bridge identity with felt cost. No false intensifiers; coincidence (vanishing hitchhiker) complicates rather than resolves. Could use one micro-loss (coins left in fiddle case?) to sharpen tactics, but pressure is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—“it is not too late to become what you never became”—emerges through the flake’s reframing of torn plastic into navigable possibility, never sermonized. The scaffold-wrap map and wet-plate shard reweight “never” into “not yet” without moralizing. Final image of crossing over reconfigures the bridge from prison to launch. One soft echo of the phrase “pixelated amnesty” feels authorial, trimming the top tenth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Margaret’s perceptual signature: sound-first metaphors, musician’s catalog of faces, photographer’s eye for silver halide. Rhythm swells and contracts—long lyrical sentences under stillness, staccato fragments (“Gone.”) at shock points. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon except the lone “pixelated amnesty” hiccup. Dialogue is minimal but voice-bearing: hitchhiker’s “Tell me…” carries subtext of summons.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean-lush: each sentence advances image or decision; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (light as chemical developer, map as negative). One mixed vehicle—“architecture of her life”—is minor. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Filter-verb count low; only two “seemed” constructions, both justified by her wondering stance. Rhythm breathes with ascent, no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines vanishing-hitchhiker trope with wet-plate collodion lore and QR-code-like wind map—synthesis feels fresh, not checklist. The flake-as-lens literalizes “re-seeing” the past; scaffold wrap as living negative is an image I haven’t seen. Risky lyric elevation could have tipped into purple but stays grounded in Margaret’s craft knowledge. Transformation test fails if you swap musician to accountant—detail is that specific.</comment>
