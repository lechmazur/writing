<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic hearing of “layered harmonies of intention” is character-specific—but the turn from passive questioning to active sabotage happens in a single line (“she could ensure others learned the truth”) without prior micro-choices that dramatize the shift. The cost (lifelong silence) is declared rather than tasted; we never feel her throat physically lock or see her first halting attempt to speak and stop. Motivation therefore jumps tracks rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: silence chosen, path foreclosed, canyon’s hunger denied. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sung echo extracts another sliver of self, and the final withholding reweights the pattern. Cost is legible in the final two sentences (“the serpentine nexus groaned… she did not look back”), though the earlier teleport from revelation to decision remains abrupt. Orientation is anchored by word 80, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but predator: its phosphorescent moss, stone corridors, and groaning hunger directly enable the harvesting mechanism and shape Mira’s final refusal. The split seashell recurs with tactile heat and remembered voice, charging the closing silence. Spatial choreography is tight—seven ravines, secret meeting chamber, the nexus center—tracked without drift. Environment thus constrains tactics and supplies the final image’s felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“why do some people echo?”—tightens into “will I be next?” once the extraction mechanism is revealed. One meaningful deepening occurs: the canyon groans when denied its feed, proving the stakes are visceral, not abstract. The protagonist’s agency is the refusal to sing, but because the shift to activist whispering is declared off-stage, the price is slightly blunted. Still, the silence directly starves the antagonist (the canyon), so causality holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme emerges without sermon: songs can be parasites, culture can farm its own. The silence-as-resistance reprises the opening “secret song” image with inverted meaning. Subtext is carried through gesture—the shell’s warmth, the nexus groan—rather than exposition. Only a trace of thematic echo appears (“some silences… are the only songs worth singing”), but it is brief and earned by the prior images, not a preachy summary.</comment>

<comment>The third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature: auditory synesthesia, stone-as-organism, star-pulsed sky. Syntax flexes from sinuous long sentences to the clipped final refusal, mirroring the move from song to silence. No dialogue appears, so no voice-contamination issues. The elevated diction (“reed-blown melancholy”) stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon of canyon-trained perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate: opening paragraph flows like an incantation, final paragraph fragments into silence. Figurative language is dense—echo as extraction, stars in rhythmic pulse—but pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. One scaffold paraphrase appears (“the canyon answered… the sound rippled outward… returning transformed”) where a tighter cut could merge clauses. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; momentum carries through 770 words without bogging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The singing canyon that metabolizes human identity is a fresh hostile-setting twist on the traditional echo trope. The extraction mechanism reframes folklore “blessing/curse” into ecological predation. Specificity—seashell half as inherited recording device, elders as careful farmers—keeps it from abstract allegory. The activist ending (whispered revolution) is less novel than the premise but grows logically from it.</comment>
