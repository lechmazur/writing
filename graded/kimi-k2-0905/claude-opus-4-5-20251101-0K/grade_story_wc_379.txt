<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingers tracing the clasp, her ear tuned to story—and her micro-choice to offer the courtyard as meeting place is earned. The contradiction between her commercial role as “discerning curator” and her quietly restorative mission charges the final image. Mrs. Okonkwo’s grief is likewise lived-in; tremor on the cane line shows cost. No stock labels or therapy-speak; voice stays individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hidden key’s reveal re-weights seventeen years of silence into speakable grief under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: locket → Mrs. O → key → mailbox; each step narrows options until dawn listening becomes inevitable. Cost is felt—“she kept the letters”—and constraints (locked box, dawn bench) shape tactics. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 15.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Courtyard’s iron benches, citrus scent, and rusted mailbox are filtered through Maren’s thrift-store eye—objects as vessels of story—so micro-setting constrains her decision to curate people, not just things. Dawn light progression tracks emotional thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: cane taps, bench settle, locket hand-off. No sensory checklist; each detail either blocks or enables the final opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be made speakable—signals early and tightens once: the key’s appearance forecloses the option to keep letters locked. Escalation is textural: each retold layer of Delphine’s myth increases density until mailbox becomes unbearable. Coincidence (locket in random coat) complicates; it does not resolve. Maren’s agency is attention; cost is the emotional bill now due at dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: listening as porous restoration. Subtext lives in gesture—thumbnail finding catch Mrs. O couldn’t teach aloud. Final image of granddaughter walking toward reclaimed memory reweights “following” into communal healing. No moralizing; ambiguity (will she enter?) lingers, making theme felt not framed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Maren, perceptual signature in thrift-store metaphors (“wrong note in familiar music”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dawn hush, fragments for cane taps. No head-hopping; Mrs. O’s interior accessed only through Maren’s read of tremor. Filter verbs minimal and motivated. Voice consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; lines do two jobs (“stories accumulated like morning dew” sets tone + stakes). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay physical—colors bleeding, mailbox exhaling—so figurative layer integrates rather than obscures. Minor register lift in “calcified into ritual” is earned by Mrs. O’s diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—locked container of grief—feels fresh because thrift-store curator becomes midwife of story, not merchant of stuff. Dawn courtyard as confessional is specific; grandmother-granddaughter triangulation via neighborhood lore rather than direct confrontation is non-obvious. Risk in quiet resolution paid off; no twist, yet inevitability feels surprising.</comment>
