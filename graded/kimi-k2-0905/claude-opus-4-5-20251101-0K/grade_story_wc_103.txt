<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to escape retrocognitive collapse yet fearing the loss of self—drives every micro-choice; the final surrender is earned because the prose has shown her steady erosion of alternatives. Embodied emotion is vivid (“her teeth ache,” “memories shiver”), but one beat of diagnostic self-labeling (“retrocognitively trapped”) slightly blunts authenticity. The renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits corporeal continuity, paying with literal dissolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara becomes the texture she sought, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior grief. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each backward pulse intensifies density until the garden’s negative curvature externalizes her plight. Cost is legible in the final image—threads of experience permanently unwoven from chronology. One minor orientation wobble: “the space where the bridges met” is slightly vague, but the garden’s impossible knot is re-anchored by tactile action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active constraint: its hyperbolic surfaces enable the final lensing that dissolves her. Selective sensory triage—“ walkways woven from intertwined branches,” “saddle-shaped surfaces”—mirrors her narrowing perception. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, its hum against palm grounding abstract geometry in somatic immediacy. Environment, tool, and body together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she escape the backward slide or be consumed by it—is signaled within 90 words and tightens through each逆向flash. One meaningful deepening occurs when photographs dissolve, proving time itself is erasing her anchor. Agency remains hers: she chooses to press the shard into the bridge knot, trading oblivion for diffusion. Cost is felt—corporeal forfeiture—but a slightly earlier visible tactical loss (a photograph vanishing mid-beat) would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not storage but living weave, and surrender can be a form of authorship. The garden’s biological architecture quietly argues that time, like roots, grows rather than flows. Final image of sharpening photographs reframes dissolution as restoration, a Conceptual Repricing that rewards reflection. One near-miss: “time was not a prison but a garden” risks overt thesis, yet the sentence is saved by its placement after the irrevocable act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains psychic distance while syntax grows more elliptical under pressure—“like a sigh releasing”—mirroring dissolution. Perceptual signature is specific: a maze designer notices geometry that breathes, parallel lines that diverge. No head-hopping; garden remains external other. Purposeful repetition of “texture” threads motif without monotony. Distinct rhythmic control heightens final diffusion without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; strong verbs (“sprawled,” “sliding,” “unwinding”) carry weight without stacked modifiers. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “water seeking lower ground” beside “threads unwinding” stays coherent because both serve the textile through-line. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One clauses cluster in peak beat (“She touched… She held… She became…”) is patterned repetition taught by prior cadence, hence accepted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines retrocognitive SF, botanical architecture, and textile metaphysics in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. The living bridge garden repurposes real-world root-bridge craft into a temporal instrument, avoiding generic “time portal.” Risk of conceptual overload is embraced and paid off: hyperbolic geometry is not jargon but the very mechanism of dissolution. Final reconfiguration—“she learned to let herself bloom within it”—flips the escape trope into ecological union, a non-obvious resolution that lingers.</comment>
