<comment>Zephyr’s “aggressive curiosity” is vivid, embodied, and motive—her micro-choice to bolt the arrow-tip to her prow crystallizes values. Interiority stays concrete (“absolutely hilarious” dissolve-or-transcend). One flaw: the Boiler only externalizes skepticism, never applies live pressure, so the status-dynamic bullet idles. Still, her irreverent courage earns a Charged Poise ending with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: kaleidoscope visions → transliterating → launch. Closure is a clean CR: the bell, once unheard, is now “listening,” reweighting the world-rule with conceptual cost. Orientation rock-solid by 50 words, no prop teleport. Minor: off-page acid physics could tighten, but it doesn’t breach causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Acid-sea workshop is no postcard: brass hisses, caustic air corrodes launch rails, the dredged arrow-tip’s green edge is handled twice. Micro-setting (arrow-tip, kaleidoscope cylinder) directly constrains the final piercing act. Sensory hierarchy obeys Zephyr’s mechanical POV—she clocks gear pitches before color. One hairline slip: acid’s exact buoyancy/gravity rule drifts, but it never governs a choice, so cap stays 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the bell ever listen?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when launch becomes the irreversible test. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the kaleidoscope’s latest vision forecloses hesitation and forces take-off with visible risk (dissolution). No second reversal, yet under causal lens that single turn is sufficient. Cost is legible: she may “dissolve,” acid mist already etching canvas.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: yearning as factory-installed bug in every gear. The bell’s shift from “unheard” to “listening” reconfigures the premise—desire creates audience. No late thesis crushes the final paragraph. Slight abstract tilt in “yearning algorithm” phrasing, but subtext in the arrow’s repurposed hunt keeps it from drifting into pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a consistent, gear-tinged diction: “mechanical heartbeat,” “mathematical hunger.” Syntax stays short, ratchety, mirroring cog-clicks; pressure scenes compress. No head-hop; POV modesty maintained—she wonders, doesn’t declare metaphysics. Boiler’s diction is distinct steam-snort. Final image (“it was listening now”) lands with rhythmic snap. One tiny filter stack in “she could transliterate” but beat is low-pressure; no 9+ bar broken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mutates with altitude: propulsive pre-launch fragments, then airy glide. Metaphors stay mechanically apt (no acid-purple clichés). No loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds torque or sensory bite. Information density high: brass hiss + history + character want in single line openings. Closure line is clean, artifact-free, sonic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fused steampunk + post-eco-apocalypse + sentient cart-glider is fresh, yet specifics make it stick: corroded hunter arrow as futurity drill-bit; bell that exists only in listening. Concept follows implications—acid sea isn’t set-dressing, it’s why flight is impossible and therefore mandatory. Risk (lyric launch without touchdown) pays off in Conceptual Repricing. Could not swap parts and keep emotional arc.</comment>
