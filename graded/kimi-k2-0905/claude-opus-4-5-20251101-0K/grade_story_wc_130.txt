<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to equations of grief while refusing tidy binaries of presence/absence—survives the climax intact; the shift from “solve for Theo” to “solve for self” is earned by every prior micro-choice. Embodied emotion (glass eyes warming, orchard glow intensifying) keeps diagnostic language at bay. The renunciation carries visible cost: she pockets the mismatched eyes “finally at peace,” a tactile admission that ambiguity will stay nestled against her skin. Voice remains singular, never sliding into explanatory jargon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the mathematics of emotion wasn’t about locating the lost… but mapping the shape loss carved.” This reweights every earlier equation and drip-tally; the cost is the irreversible acceptance of a living hollow. Causal chain holds—each mosaic gap → variable assignment → conjured composite—and ends in earned stasis rather than fake resurrection. Lens stays accumulative/textural throughout; the final cadence shift (“green shoot of optimism”) is the pattern break that crystallizes meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is never mere wallpaper: drip intervals supply the “mathematics” she literalizes, phosphorescent moss feeds both fruit and spell-light, stalactite fissures frame the moon as natural lens. The mosaic stepping stone is micro-setting that doubles as calculator—every missing tile a live variable that constrains her finger-traced algebra. Spatial choreography stays clean (kneel, place brown eye at spiral, green at tree-branch) without puppet-master narration. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and recharging the final image of “orchard seemed brighter.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the shape loss carved”—tightens once: the apparition’s declaration forces her shift from retrieval to self-definition. Cost is legible: she forfeits the dream of recovering Theo’s laugh, embracing instead “a living hollow she could carry.” No escalation spiral is needed under an accumulative lens; the single deepening reweights all prior tallies. Pressure stays coherent because external antagonist is the orchard’s own unalterable drip-law, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: ambiguous loss as an uncloseable wound that can, nonetheless, sprout. Subtext lives in gesture—tilting head “so familiar her chest ached” while she denies identity—avoiding explanatory labels. Final image of “green shoot of optimism” is resonant reconfiguration, not moral; it re-prices the orchard’s darkness without declaring victory. No echo of prompt language or tidy thesis statement appears, satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mira’s perceptual signature: stalactite drip counted like heartbeats, erosion read as “language,” glass eyes that “watched from her palm.” Syntax tightens under stress—fragments (“Not Theo, but not nothing either”) mimic breath-catch. No filter-verb stacks; even metaphor (“voice like wind through orchard branches”) is focalizer-apt. Voice modulation from obsessive calibration to quiet acceptance is seamless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet airy: one sentence often does three jobs (“apple trees… heavy with fruit nourished by the eternal drip” sets scene, stakes metaphor, foreshadows spell-fuel). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each descriptor is unrepeatable. Rhythm breathes—long limb-movement sentences collapse into staccato realizations (“You’re not him”). Only hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” phrase appears twice; second use is justified as conscious mantra, so artifact stays minor and clear of closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of taxidermy + conjuring + grief-math feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted. Orchard-as-laboratory freshens the “underground garden” trope by making geology the nutrient clock. The chipped mosaic as algebraic keypad is a genuinely inventive pivot. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off because closure reweights pattern rather than delivering cheap resurrection.</comment>
