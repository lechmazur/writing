<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in the asbestos-lung detail and the seventeen-year tunnel; the amber bead touch crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, but the “religiously skeptical” label is asserted more than dramatized. The final resolve is earned because every step deeper into the tunnel forfeits the comfort of the old run-away narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because Clara’s calls exist → Marcus interprets → finds valve room → bead count reweights reality. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—thirty-seven beads make the ghost shift undeniable and Marcus’s life-task legible. Cost is visible in the exhausted sit-down and the new weight he chooses to carry out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bead-strung valve wheel functions as micro-setting that literally steers the final appraisal beat; tunnel air (“drowsy alertness”) mirrors the confession hush and sharpens after the bead discovery. Spatial choreography is clean—boots on gravel, flashlight arcs, damp wall—anchoring the single scene. Selective sensory detail (dust taste, rusted spokes) supports stakes without catalog bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove Daniela didn’t run—tightens when the amber bead forecloses that escape myth; thirty-seven beads raise the communal cost and narrow Marcus’s options to public reckoning. One meaningful escalation suffices here: discovery → count → vow to drag truth into daylight. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of erased labor and swallowed truths emerges from the beads-as-memorial image rather than editorial. Final image—amber catching light once more—reweights the earlier carnival necklace into collective testimony. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance lingers in the decision to make the uncounted counted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is skeptic-mechanic (asbestos as “mountain air,” flashlight arcs). Syntax modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped appraisal beats, mirroring the shift from brooding to evidence gathering. No head-hop or register drift; “religiously skeptical” is the only slightly canned phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language (“tunnel mouth gaped like a confession”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in the hush motif. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “drowsy alertness of three in the morning” is repeated almost verbatim; still under cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-shift premise revitalizes the familiar missing-sister trope by tying it to recession-era labor abuse; the beaded valve as clandestine memorial feels specific and inevitable. Risk—using a single static found object for climax—pays off because the appraisal action reconfigures stakes. No derivative echoes; detail like “asbestos like mountain air” brands the voice.</comment>
