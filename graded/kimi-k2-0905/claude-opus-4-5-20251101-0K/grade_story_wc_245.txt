<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Meridia’s interiority is tactile and specific—decoding grief through bark grain, choosing the “quiet blaze” over neutrality—so the final stance feels earned. The only drag is the late-cue “dying woman” commission; stakes crystallize after the midpoint rather than driving every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she charts the stillpoint, then renounces it, paying with permanent exile from that neutrality. Causal chain holds: ring → branch → musical trail → silence → choice; no teleporting props or retroactive rules. Orientation is late (commission revealed ~⅔ in) but the delay is functional—it mirrors her own delayed understanding of the gift—so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest, platinum ring, and bark-as-text function as micro-settings that actively channel her route; each tool constraints motion and is handled, not observed. Sensory economy is POV-filtered—she “hears” through boot leather—so place feels lived-in, not toured. Final image of ring humming toward “home” re-anchors the entire trek.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the stillpoint—tightens once: arrival forces the choice to keep or reject neutrality. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 750-word scope; cost is visible (she forfeits eternal calm). Agency drives every beat: dowsing, mapping, renouncing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of cartographing feeling: neutrality is mappable yet uninhabitable. No moralizing; the realization is dramatized in her physical retreat from the silent clearing. Final “quiet blaze” reweights earlier “steady burning,” giving conceptual cost to choosing messiness over numbness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside her perceptual logic—ultrasonic textures, ring pulls, bark grammar—without POV slippage. Syntax lengthens in calmer passages, fragments under sensorial rush, mirroring heartbeat of discovery. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy clauses and staccato sense beats, supporting the musical-trail tension. Figurative language is dense but patterned (tree grammar, emotional geometries) so it teaches its own idiom; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loops (“frequencies... frequencies”) recur but never touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dendritic linguistics with emotional cartography—fresh without gimmickry. Stillpoint-as-doorway twist is seeded by ring silence yet remains non-obvious. Risky second-person-esque address to reader (“you”) never appears; story trusts its own mythic interiority.</comment>
