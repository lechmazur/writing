<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Martha’s interiority is concrete, her contradictory impulses (needing Dad as martyr vs. hating the abandonment) act in scene, and the final micro-choice—gathering photos to tell the true story—pays a visible cost (her myth dies). The “precisely humane” trait is shown, not labeled: she refuses to shame her mother even when the truth hurts. Flaw complicity is acknowledged; no hedged safety. Dialogue absent, so relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored hush reweights every prior image once Martha says “He left.” Cost is felt—37 yrs of myth dissolve. Causal chain intact: silent chime → photo trail → ticket-window reveal → renunciation of myth. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. No artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Valley, ridgeway, dripping station, and wind-chime silence are filtered through Martha’s levee-warden gaze; each sensory pick guides her next micro-move toward the ticket window. The sapphire label’s survival on a high shelf is a micro-setting detail that constrains her final decision to confess. Spatial choreography clean; no filler landscape postcarding. Environment charges the mirrored-hush closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over the town’s memory—tightens when each photo narrows her myth’s escape route. Agency visible: she chooses to climb to the station, to look, to speak the truth aloud; each step forfeits the martyr story. Cost legible: the silence after “He left” is the loss of 37 yrs of shield. Escalation causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mercy and truth: the reservoir literally gives up bones, Martha metaphorically gives up the lie. No moralizing final paragraph; the final image of empty streets “ready to speak” reweights all prior submersion imagery. Subtext in the drip percussion and mirrored hush lands ironic cost—silence now speaks truth. Complexity embraced: father remains loved and resented.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Martha’s perceptual signature: copper tubes “catch every breath,” liqueur label “still adhered,” streets “like bones.” No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her rural-watcher lexicon. Rhythm accelerates up the ridge, then breathes into the final mirrored hush. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “the reservoir had finally surrendered” packs hydrology + defeat in five words. Varied sentence cadence; no template churn. Figurative language sparse, precise—“like bones from ancient earth” reappears as CR. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and final lines bookend with wind & silence. No artifact within final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar “drowned town resurfaces” trope is inverted: the returned buildings expose a personal lie rather than ghostly horror. Photograph trail as detective device freshens the excavation. Risk taken in quiet, lyric ending that refuses revenge or reunion; specificity of Bellweather’s Blue recipe roots it. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
