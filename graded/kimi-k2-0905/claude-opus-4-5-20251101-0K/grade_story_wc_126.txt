<comment>Interiority is specific—"absence of what should have been there"—and the copper bowl anchors humility as a lived value. The micro-shift from resisting to listening inside the hush dramatizes contradiction; the final renunciation (imperfect music tomorrow) costs her the shelter of silence she just reclaimed. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV voice stays coherent. Emotional progression avoids tidy stages, landing in earned, wistful poise rather than cure.</comment>

<comment>Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is re-priced from suffocation to "space between notes," cost felt in the copper-glow image. Causal chain is slim—choice is internal listening—but sufficient under Accumulative lens; pattern taught early with smoke-settled quiet and intensifies via orchard/glass/water density. Orientation clean by line 5; no props teleport. Persistent constraint (hush) shapes every tactical note she plays; price visible when she accepts imperfection publicly tomorrow.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sunken greenhouse, cracked panes, salt-clouded glass, and tide-lapped wrecks create an irreplaceable micro-setting that physically alters acoustics and forces her to play "between" sounds. Apple trees and copper bowl are handled, not catalogued; their states evolve (unripe fruit at start / bowl glowing at end) to mirror internal shift. Spatial anchors hold across single scene; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys her acoustic bias—sound textures prioritized over visuals—staying character-bound.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she make music inside the hush—signaled in para 1 and tightens once: from fighting silence to collaborating with it. Agency is renunciation/stance crystallization rather than external reversal; that single deepening is proportionate to 700-word scope. Cost is legible: she forfeits the private shelter of silence for imperfect public performance. No coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: unfinished apples, broken glass, truncated stories, and interrupted music collectively reweight "unfinished" from flaw to beauty without declarative moral. Final image—copper bowl glowing like ember—offers non-literal answer: endurance itself glows. No thematic echo sentence; subtext carried by gesture and object. Ambiguity remains—readers can question if public playing will survive next silence—yet coherence intact.</answer>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Marina’s acoustic perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with listening pauses; short clauses imitate hush without drum-beat monotony. Diction stays within coastal musician lexicon—"rosin," "waterlogged," "barnacles"—no academic register drift. Single POV, so dialogue bullets waived; voice texture remains distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean: 712 words carry orchard, wreck, and emotional arc without scaffold. Figurative language is spare—smoke "settled into everything," bowl "glowed like an ember"—and avoids purple density. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: longer sentences for tide rise, clipped fragments for bow strokes; openings vary, no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-catastrophe eco-parable meets practice-room acoustics; "chronic hush" as antagonist is non-obvious. Risk—quiet lyric ending without external triumph—paid off via Charged Poise. Transformation test fails if relocated inland or swapped instrument; specificity is high. No close echoes; avoids familiar zombie/climate tropes by focusing on sound absence rather than destruction spectacle.</comment>
