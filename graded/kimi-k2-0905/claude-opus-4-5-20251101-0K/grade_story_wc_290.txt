<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Helena’s claustrophobia is dramatized through crawling the 3-ft passage—embodied cost visible in “her racing heart” vs “stubborn will.” The micro-choice to crawl is credibly motivated by inherited obsession and the literal lock-fit payoff. Grandmother’s absence keeps relational crucible off-page, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: organ chord sequence → stone panel opens → compass point fits lock → archives open. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: dawn light and distant bells reweight grandmother’s lost years. Persistent constraint—claustrophobia—shapes every tactical move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Shadowed nexus under starlight” and 3-ft passage function as micro-settings that physically constrain choice. Compass point as tool-as-setting charges the final image when it mates with the lock. Selective sensory detail (moonlit glass shards, vibrating low C) keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the archives—tightens once: the crawl is the irreversible cost that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each organ note raises stakes until the passage demands literal bodily payment. No coincidence; resolution is lock-and-key earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “spatial mutiny” emerges through action, not statement: the body’s betrayal vs the refusal to be contained. Final image of dawn bells reframes grandmother’s absence into collective legacy—resonant without moralizing. No thematic echo; wistfulness stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters through Helena’s risk calculus and bodily panic. No head-hopping; prose modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped clauses during crawl. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, motion, and backstory (“She moved through the rubble… malicious intent”). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors are spare and coherent. Rhythm breathes—long organ chord sentence vs staccato crawl.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: claustrophobia + antique organ cryptography + navigational archives. Compass point retooled as key feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken in making the climax a horizontal crawl rather than vertical ascent pays off.</comment>
