<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam’s interior contradiction—yearning to “understand transformation” while compulsively freezing moments—grounds every beat; the final release of the fireflies externalizes a visible cost (empty jars, unfootprinted sand). The philanthropic past is summary, never dramatized, so the “Saint/Fool” duality stays abstract and caps depth. Still, her micro-choices on the beach (open, open, open) accumulate to an earned renunciation that forecloses her archive and leaves her literally lighter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellation disperses, re-weighting the premise from capture to surrender with undeniable felt cost (heat-drained sand, vanished trail). Accumulative lens holds: each jar cracked open tightens the pattern toward release rather than causal reversal. Orientation is swift—black sand, volcano whisper, Jupiter-Saturn dance anchor by line 4. No plot amnesia; the geologist’s detour reroutes but does not resolve the ritual—agency remains Miriam’s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting supremacy: the seventeen glass jars function as portable crucibles—handled, opened, heated, emptied—directly constraining the final gesture. Volcanic hush and bioluminescent surf filter through Miriam’s synesthetic need to “feel transformation,” never as postcard filler. Spatial choreography is immaculate; jars arc, fireflies rise, twin planetary shadows stripe the waves. Heat-retaining sand and tide erase footprints, embedding cost in the tactile world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand transformation”—is dramatized as the need to stop hoarding light. Escalation is textural: each opened jar thins her archive, deepening the stakes of the next until the seventeenth empties the crucible. No external antagonist required; pressure is the mounting absence she chooses. Cost is visible in the final image: empty hands, tide-smoothed sand, prophecy fulfilled only by forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of capture as liberation; no character moralizes. The firefly constellation that “hangs briefly… then disperses” reweights the entire motif from preservation to impermanence without commentary. Subtext resides in silence—the volcano’s applause-like hush answers her lifelong question with breath, not words. Final line’s equivalence of philanthropist and tide avoids platitude by concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Miriam’s perceptual signature: astronomical patience, fiscal metaphors (“wealth felt like walls”), synesthetic craving for texture. Syntax lengthens and contracts with planetary or wing motion; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Register never drifts into self-help; even “texture of transformation” is earned through decades of tactile obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like surf: long planetary sentences crash against fragmentary jar openings. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—obsidian ribbon, crushed fruit world—never muddling causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final clause “tides, like philanthropists, give everything away” crystallizes prior diction without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of volcanic prophecy, entomological time-capsule, and astronomical conjunction feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced and paid off in the dispersal image. The philanthropic backstory could be any divestment tale, but the bottled-light archive and planetary clock particularize it beyond trope. Not quite genre-bending, but the speculative edge is integral, not decorative.</comment>
