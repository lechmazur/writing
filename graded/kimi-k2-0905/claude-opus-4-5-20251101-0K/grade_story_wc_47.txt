<comment>Mira’s watchful-dreamer trait is shown through pattern sketching and attention to micro-detail, but her interiority stays safe: “she worked quietly” repeats rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The pendant transfer is credible, yet the moment of relinquishment is externally calm—no visible cost tremor or hesitation that would foreclose a path. Thea’s guilt is asserted more than embodied; her single whispered line carries little distinct voice. Both sisters reach acceptance, but the emotional price feels inferred, not enacted on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant hand-off crystallizes forgiveness inside the moss garden, reconfiguring their stance with felt quiet cost. Causal lens holds—Mira’s earlier pattern noticing motivates the offering, and Thea’s presence is the because/therefore result of viral fallout. Orientation is clean by word 80. Minor slip: “the honeyed hush absorbed their words” is abstract; the beat would sharpen if the space physically constrained them (echo, dampness). Still, the image reweights prior motifs and meets the 9− gate for resonance.</comment>

<comment>The data-center-turned-garden is vivid, selective, and guides choice: Mira kneels where melt-water once dripped, turning ceiling decay into pattern discovery. Bench of intertwined ferns later hosts the reconciliation, so environment literally furnishes the closure. Sensory balance favors emerald, velvet, honeyed—visual and tactile—while sound (former server hum versus present hush) supplies temporal layer. No world-rule violations; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skylight to bench.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—repairing sister rupture after public shaming—is signaled early. Escalation is situational: pressure accumulates through Mira’s attention and Thea’s arrival; no new antagonist, but silence thickens stakes. Pendant transfer narrows options: Mira relinquishes protective talisman, accepting shared grief. Cost is present but muted—no tangible loss (time, safety, object function) beyond symbolic give; hence entry 8-band remains just out of reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through moss colonizing servers and Mira colonizing pain with pattern-finding; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: pendant offered palms-up like childhood cocoa invokes entire maternal history without naming it. Final image—intertwined ferns—mirrors entwined sisters, reweighting “growth over wholeness” idea. Slight abstraction in “honeyed hush” softens resonance; still, particulars carry the conceptual freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira, filtering every notice through her bias of silence and pattern; perceptual signature is consistent. Syntax stays calm, slightly languid, matching garden tempo; no drum-beat templates. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct—Thea’s whispered “I should have been there” breaks hush with short, plain guilt. Free indirect slips are clean; no POV leakage into Thea’s mind beyond observable tears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density: each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—“emerald velvet,” “columns wrapped in ferns”—and align with garden palette. Minor scaffold: “something quieter: life reclaiming its territory” restates prior clause; one paraphrase loop, but outside closure beat. No strained vehicles or register drift; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalypse data-center broached before, yet fusion with grief-repair and pattern-finding gives fresh emotional tilt. Moss following invisible icicle drips supplies a lovely, non-obvious causal trace. Risk is moderate—quiet reconciliation in eco-ruin rather than plot twist—but coherence justifies choice. Concept stays committed; no late rule changes.</comment>
