<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—duty-bound reaper vs. grieving lover—drives every micro-choice; the crystallizing ritual externalizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The moment she finishes the dead’s sentences, her stoic mask cracks and the glass figurines embody the price. No stock labels; grief is shown via tactile handling of atlas ink and light. Earned renunciation: she descends carrying the named fears instead of erasing them—an irreversible stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystallized grief array reweights her eternal vocation under a new rule—she will ferry souls while finishing their silences. Causal chain intact: atlas page → scattered sunset → naming ritual → literal crystallization → changed reaper. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is on-page: “she would carry this with her now.” Persistent constraint: glass menagerie she must protect while reaping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Observatory dome, brass telescope, and fractured sunset beams are not backdrop—they enable the crystallization engine that resolves the stake. Atlas page acts as micro-setting handled in three beats, its ink chemistry altered by light angle. Spatial choreography clean: spiral ascent, page lifted into shaft, figurines gathered at floor level. Environment constrains the ritual to dusk only, tightening the window of change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she survive loving the dead without being consumed—tightens when the naming ritual forces a trade: keep duty but carry visible grief. One meaningful deepening: shift from passive haunting to active voicing of unfinished phrases. Escalation is textural density: each completed sentence spawns a new crystal, making regret physically cumulative. Cost legible: the glass creatures are permanent weight in her cloak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: naming fear transmutes exile into intimacy. No moralizing; the final image of starlit descent lets the glass catch first starlight—an unspoken answer that love’s residue can coexist with death’s work. Subtext in the atlas margins: sea monsters = unnamed regrets, a metaphor that flips from terror to beauty via crystallization. Emotional aftereffect lingers: reader left holding fragile glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“scythe scraping,” “wax cylinders,” “prismatic fragments”—is reaper-specific, not generic gothic. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fractures into short declaratives during crystallization, mirroring control cracking. No head-hopping; all perception filtered through Mira’s biased attention to light and edges. Voice remains consistent even when borrowing the dead’s phrases, signaled by italics of remembered speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language sparse and precise—“sunset fractured through the ancient glass”—never stacked. Strong verbs: “scraping,” “shattered,” “crystallize.” Rhythm modulates: long sentence for climb, staccato for crystal birth. No register drift; astronomical and cartographic terms stay within POV lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image—“her scythe silent now.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—reaper + cartographer + sea-monster atlas + light alchemy—feels inevitable, not stitched. Fresh inflection: grief literally crystallized into collectible art, turning afterlife labor into curatorial act. Risk of sentimentality avoided by glass fragility that could cut. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; atlas page’s ink chemistry and sunset angle are irreplaceable. Concept commits fully without late rule changes.</comment>
