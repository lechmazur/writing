<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied—Mariam’s “hands learning the quiet talent of coaxing life from salt-blasted soil” shows trait-through-action. The contradiction between freeze response and deliberate caretaking is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choices (hand on earth, counting somatic markers) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation—tending orchids tomorrow even if the sky “might hold anything”—earns its cost via prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of coastal garden imagery and trauma callbacks tighten around the final “pearl of stillness.” Closure is Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt in the photograph tucked away and the vow to return. Orientation anchored by line 6 (“cliffside gardens…Pacific”). No causality breaks; trauma memory is cued by watering can and hawk, not teleported. Persistent constraint: freeze response remains live, shapes tomorrow’s return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Arboretum-as-micro-setting constrains every beat—salt wind, torn netting, cliff soil—forcing Mariam’s body and tools into specific tactical reactions (hand flat to earth, transplant knife use). Sensory hierarchy mirrors professional priorities: plant stress signals before scenic vista. Final image of greenhouse seedlings is inseparable from cliff-edge exposure; remove arboretum and the entire tactile vocabulary collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: daily survival-and-care under ongoing trauma threat. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory cue (hawk, fog lift, photo) tightens the somatic vise, deepening the cost of staying. No external antagonist; pressure is internal weather. One visible price—photo returned to pocket—cements tomorrow’s risk and renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative image pairings: cultivated life vs. indifferent ocean, freeze vs. foster, photograph vs. seedling. No thematic statement; final line “the arboretum held her” reweights premise—care as resistance, not cure. Ambiguity stays intact: sky “might hold anything.” Pearl motif recurs only twice, each time shifting meaning under pressure, earning resonance without checklist symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is horticultural—plants “clinging,” roots “threading,” orchids as stress-barometers. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under hawk-triggered freeze. No dialogue, so voice carries subtext alone. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are justified by somatic tracking; diction stays within gardener-therapist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety propels without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tide receding for panic—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “both she and the orchids were survivors…both required specific conditions” (−0.2). Information density high; single sentences fold time, body, tool. Closure image “seedlings waited in their careful rows” is crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: trauma-botany hybrid where plant-care lexicon becomes PTSD vocabulary. Lighthouse-after-life frame offers oblique climate-grief angle. Risk taken with quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final charged poise. Could edge higher if hawk cue or pearl motif had been weaponized into one sharper turn.</comment>
