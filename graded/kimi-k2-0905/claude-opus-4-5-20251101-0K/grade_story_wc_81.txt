<comment>Maren’s quiet, cataloguing nature is vivid and consistent; the stamp-in-hand moment embodies her values. The interior contradiction—yearning for truth yet fearing the library’s erasure—never sharpens into a visible micro-cost: she never risks anything tangible (time, safety, reputation) to reach the ledger. The final “earned stasis” is gentle but registers mainly as emotional confirmation, not foreclosure with measurable price. Still, her perceptual signature and embodied stillness give her memorable individuality.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: blackout → silence → hidden compartment → ledger discovery → identity recognition → new index entry. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stamp’s meaning flips, giving Maren a new genealogical self-definition and a public act (updating registry) that costs her prior neutrality. The ledger reveal is the visible cost—handling centuries-old proof that implicates her own profession—but the price feels intellectual rather than visceral. Orientation is secure; lens holds; minor slack in that the ledger coincidence could have been seeded earlier.</comment>

<comment>The sunken-library dome is not backdrop but active pressure: darkness dictates perceptual method, humidity warps pages, kelp glow enables discovery. Micro-setting—the desk compartment—literally births the plot. Spatial choreography is flawless across stacks and eastern drips. For 9+, the environment doesn’t quite force a tactic change at climax (she was already indexing), so stays just below top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—truth of the stamp—tightens when blackout removes scholarly noise, channelling attention to hidden ledger; blackout functions as both complication and opportunity. No antagonist or ticking clock, but the risk of epistemic loss supplies pressure. Agency is cognitive (methodical reading, indexing) rather than physical, adequate for lens. Cost is present (her name now publicly sides with Celia, exposing her to future critique), yet escalation stays cerebral; intensity plateaus rather than spikes at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet custodianship vs. institutional myth-making emerges entirely through concrete particulars—stamp, ledger, index entry—never abstract assertion. Final image of dark-blue sigil beside Maren’s signature reweights “stillness” from absence to deliberate resistance. Subtextual irony: future scholars may again misread her entry, continuing the cycle, but the piece lets that echo rather than preach. Complexity is honoured; no moral spoon-feeding in closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, perceptually skewed to millimetre-level noticing (“book spine shifted by millimetres”). Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are spare and organic (“stillness settle around her like sediment”). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during discovery, mirroring emotional contour. Distinctiveness is high; slight deduction for occasional elevated diction (“dappled resolve”) that edges toward the poetic-generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is efficient, lyrical without purple drift; most sentences carry double duty (atmosphere + motive or object state). Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on hinge discoveries. No mixed metaphors, no template cadences, no scaffold sentences. Minor synonym clustering around “stillness/still” and “darkness/dark” but does not stall momentum; remains within tolerance for high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses archival noir with drowned-city wonder; focus on indexer as truth-warrior feels fresh. Object-driven mystery (stamp) transcends MacGuffin by becoming identity emblem. Risk is taken with quiet, anti-thriller plot—no chase, no villain—yet coherence is complete. Synthesis of bioluminescent kelp and cataloguing ethics is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
