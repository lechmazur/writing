<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt and need to atone are viscerally embodied (kneeling, sealing the bottle); his metaphor habit is shown, not told, and collides with the raw apology. The ghost’s shift from tormented to luminous is legible in her final gesture. One flaw: the “gossip-column exorcist” tag is asserted but never dramatized—no press flashbulbs, no snide asides—so the outer persona feels ornamental rather than a lived contradiction inside this scene. Still, the interior hierarchy (guilt > reputation) is clear and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he failed thirty years ago, he now rigs copper coils to finish the symphony and trap the demon. Orientation is swift (who/where/by ~80 words). Closure is Earned Stasis: he ends kneeling among dead scores, carrying both demon and dream—cost visible in the double weight. Minor slack: the electromagnetic method is sprung late, so the beat feels slightly conjured, not seeded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Archive air (“dust and forgotten symphonies”) is smelled, tasted, heard in fluttering pages; the perfume bottle’s faceted glint becomes a handheld star that guides the trap. Micro-setting succeeds: the third-row seventh shelf is a spatial anchor that later delivers the manuscript. Orchard threat is sensed through chainsaw dawn, not just declared. Environment never over-described; every detail either chills the ghost or narrows Marcus’s tactical options.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free Eleanor’s soul before the orchard anchor vanishes—is signaled early and tightens when chainsaws wake at dawn. The electromagnetic attempt is the one meaningful escalation; failure would leave her “smoke” homeless. Cost is legible: Marcus kneels in defeat-redemption, knowing the orchard—and part of his own myth—will still be erased. Stakes remain personal, not abstract; no world-saving inflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through unfinished creative work as spiritual parasite: “some demons require us to finish what we started.” Subtext in the perfume bottle—mother’s scent, Eleanor’s tether—reweights from relic to prison. No moralizing; the final image of man carrying demon and symphony in dawn gray lets ambiguity linger. The orchard’s scheduled erasure silently asks what art survives erasure—question, not answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hop. Voice is metaphor-steeped yet precise: “voice like wind through hollow reeds,” “crystal facets catching what little light remained.” Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens under generator hum, mirroring tension. Ghost’s diction (“My mother’s. I thought it was lost”) is distinct, airy, yet goal-driven—she wants the bottle back, then the symphony played.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: cumulative clauses for archive dust, staccato for generator click. No filter-verb stacks; props (bottle, copper coils) are handled, not catalogued. One micro-loop: “nothing is ever truly lost” / “sometimes things simply wait…” is a near-paraphrase; tolerable because it’s the character’s verbal tic. Final line “ethereal gray morning” risks modifier overload but lands as tonal chord, not purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing electromagnetic exorcism with musical manuscript rescue feels fresh; trope of failed priest is redeemed by making the failure the inciting past. “Imperfect miracle” reframes standard exorcism into artisanal, provisional grace. Specificity—copper coils humming like a church organ—prevents gimmick. Risk: late-intro tech could feel deus-machina, but story seeds “unorthodox methods” early, so payoff is earned.</comment>
