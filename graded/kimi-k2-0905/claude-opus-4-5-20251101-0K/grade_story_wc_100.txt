<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ezra’s refusal to discard the lens crystallizes his “inadvertently stubborn” trait into a vocation; the micro-choice to press his palm to the shard lets oceanic knowledge flood him, fusing trait to stakes. Interiority stays concrete: saltwater in lungs becomes coordinates, not a label. Final exhaustion feels earned because each burial costs him literal breath and sleep, visible in “weariness deepened.” Cap at 8.7 because no second on-page character pressures him; all status/relationship bullets are N/A.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: “some things must be buried before they can be kept” reweights the premise with conceptual cost—his lifelong flight from stillness ends in chosen stillness. Causal chain holds: lens fragment → heartbeat signal → underwater library → burial rites → lens restored; each because/therefore tightens his options. Orientation anchor (“Tuesday”) arrives at word 4; no penalty. Cost is legible in final image: intact lens glows but no longer signals, its silence the price of their peace.</comment>

<comment>Kelp-wrapped parcel, saltwater on workbench, coral-crusted spires—details are filtered through undertaker pragmatism (“his hands intimate with silence”). Micro-setting rule met: the lens itself constrains every choice once handled. Spatial choreography clean: descent through “impossible spaces between shelves” is internally consistent under dream-logic taught early. Atmospheric tone of “chased stillness” modulates from mortuary hush to submarine hush, charging the final image.</question>

<comment>Dominant stake—grant unwitnessed dead their witness—signals in line 1 via package “addressed to no one living.” Each burial rite tightens the cost: seven nights blur, lungs fill with ocean, exhaustion accumulates. Agency remains his: he “spoke aloud” each name, fusing fragments. One micro-turn suffices at this length; escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal, and lands with felt fatigue that forecloses further wandering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: burial as reciprocal rescue—by entombing the drowned, Ezra entombs his own restlessness. Subtext in final line: ocean “breathed against distant shores” reprises the heartbeat motif now pacified. No moralizing; wisdom is earned through salt-lung labor. Image of lens “quiet colors” reweights earlier fracturing into peace, satisfying Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is undertaker-poetic: tactile, unsentimental, salt-stained. Perceptual signature sharp: “geometry bent like grief.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for submersion, fragmentary beats for surfacing—without losing control. No dialogue to contaminate voice; internal monologue stays concrete. Elision (“seven nights—or what felt like nights”) is pattern-taught and paid off in disorientation that replicates Ezra’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “saltwater pooled on his workbench” does world, object, sensory, and metaphoric work in seven words. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. Figurative language sparse and precise—“books closed like eyes”—no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive, bookending with luminous object. Minor scaffold: “impossible spaces” repeated twice but serves dream architecture; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker + drowned library + lighthouse lens = inverted beacon guiding dead home. Drowned archives, coral card-catalogues, bioluminescent fish reading rooms are particular to this vision. Risk-taking (dream descent) is fully committed; payoff is emotional, not gimmick. Premise would collapse if lens swapped for compass—irreplaceable specificity. Final hush feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
