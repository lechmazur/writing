<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to coins while preaching dissolution—surfaces only in summary; the final “quiet enthusiasm” is declared, not embodied. No micro-choice shows her paying a tangible cost (a coin falls, is spent, is surrendered). The backwards prophecy is accepted without dramatized struggle, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the impossible coins-on-edge crystallize the cost of accepting un-becoming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each casting thickens pattern until the amber itself re-illuminates. One causality gap: the prophecy’s first arrival is off-stage, so the stakes’ origin is told, not tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The amber deck, foreign coins, and backwards static are sensuously textured and filter every action; the spiral coin-arrangement literally guides the final alignment. Environment doubles as body: the amber contracts around Mira, turning setting into fate. Micro-setting qualifies and charges the last image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“wavelength align with purpose” vs. annihilation—is signaled early and tightens through each casting. The penultimate throw that yields the backwards sentence is the single visible escalation; cost is conceptual (accepting dissolution) rather than viscerally felt. No live option is foreclosed on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as resistance against erasure—emerges from the coin spiral and amber preservation without sermon. The final glow reweights earlier images (coins, static, amber) into a single resonant chord. Ambiguity survives: is alignment transcendence or extinction? No moral is pronounced; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person interiority stays close to Mira’s perceptual signature—numismatic precision, cosmic scale, hushed restraint. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures during static bursts, mirroring entropy reversal. No head-hop or register drift; elision (“—beginning the reach you…”) is pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles (amber, coins, static) remain internally consistent. One scaffold loop: “pattern spoke… pattern taught… pattern spoke” within 60 words. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final sentence glows without overwriting. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to the staccato reversed message, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Collapsing-universe divination via coin-casting is fresh; the backwards prophecy subverts deterministic tropes by making memory the active force. Risky temporal inversion is committed to, not gimmicked: every beat serves the reversal logic. Specific numismatic and cosmological detail prevents abstraction; the story would break if coins were swapped for cards or bones.</comment>
