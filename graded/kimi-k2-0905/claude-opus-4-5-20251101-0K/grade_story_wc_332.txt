<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Miriam’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in concrete nightly actions; the micro-choice to climb the fog-roof anyway crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays particular—counting lost details of her mother’s hair, the “luminous absence growing heavier.” The final endurance—accepting a presence-through-absence—is earned by the prior failed experiments and costs her sleep, safety, and the last illusions of retrieval. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; all struggle is retrospective, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sunrise attempt layers density until the fog-morning pattern-break yields the first readable image. Closure is a Charged Poise—Miriam gains a sustainable ritual and teachable stance, foreclosing the option of ever “catching” the dream whole; cost is the permanent distance the photograph confirms. Causality holds: palette → experiments → fog-break → teachable moment. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whispering wind and seventeen-island geography are filtered through Miriam’s nocturnal solitude, guiding her decision to use the roof at 4 A.M. The empty pigment wells function as micro-setting, constraining how light can fracture and thus how memory can appear. Fog and sunrise are not backdrop but tactical variables that decide whether the palette will yield an image. Sensory selection is urgent and narrow—golden blade, impossible colors—mirroring the narrowing bandwidth of the dream.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the runaway dream before total erasure”—is signaled in paragraph two. Stakes tighten when she can no longer recall her mother’s hair color, turning abstract loss into measurable attrition. The fog-morning provides one decisive escalation: risk climbing blind or forfeit the last chance. Resolution (accepting partial, repeatable images) costs the fantasy of full recovery and is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: absence can be made visible if you learn its wavelength. The cipher is never decoded; instead Miriam learns to inhabit its grammar—“light itself carries memory if you know how to read it.” Final image reweights earlier failures into sustainable practice, offering no moral, only resonance. Subtext in the cupped, still-unnameable gift keeps ambiguity alive while emotional honesty remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Miriam’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is precise—“luminous absence,” “impossible colors.” Syntax lengthens in reflective passages, then compresses under dawn urgency. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to what she can see or infer. Free-indirect moments (“she understood now”) are cleanly sign-posted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long, tide-like sentences to the staccato “She pressed the shutter.” Figurative language is sparse but purposeful—“a sudden blade of gold”—never clustering into purple. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Copy is clean; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “photograph memory-through-dawn-light” device is fresh, yet grounded in Elara’s pseudo-scientific journal, avoiding magic-hand-waving. Grief-work through refractive optics feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Specificity—17 islands, knee-deep golden water, empty pigment wells—prevents generic “grief equals light” metaphor. Risk is taken with accumulative structure rather than twist, and coherence holds.</comment>
