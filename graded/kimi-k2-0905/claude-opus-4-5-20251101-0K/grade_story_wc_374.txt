<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s “luminous skeptic” persona is vividly embodied through her taste-based sensing and the ring’s empty-center orientation; her brother-loss motive remains active and charges the final acceptance. Interior contradiction is alive when she tastes truth yet still questions. The three weather-carriers function as immediate external pressure, forcing her micro-choice to take the charged leaf—visible cost scaled to length. No stock therapy-speak; only the “why some people carry weather” line flirts with abstraction but is saved by sensory follow-through.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (taste, scent, magnetic taste) thickens the pattern until the empty ring reframes purpose. The brother reveal is causally motivated via forest-weather symbiosis and lands as conceptual repricing—she redefines disappearance as distributed merger. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) secure within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is felt when she tastes “petrichor and possibility,” foreclosing the old search.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery: magnetic fluctuations alter scent release, guiding Vera’s tongue; the voting forest below directly harvests her brother’s storm. The ring-as-micro-setting constrains her final orientation. Spatial choreography tracks the three approaching figures cleanly. Selective sensory hierarchy (taste > sight) mirrors POV bias and charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn why some carry weather”—tightens when she discovers the forest’s electoral theft of her brother; option to “find him” collapses into “join the system.” Escalation is textural: each weather-carrier adds a new flavor-note that deepens cost rather than narrows plot paths. Visible price: she tastes tomorrow’s copper, accepting merger. No coincidence resolves; the leaf’s charge is earned by prior atmospheric logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sensory particulars: climate instability demands human anchorage, skepticism becomes participation. No final moral—image of tongue on empty ring reweights premise. Subtext resides in taste-metals (copper/ozone) and electoral metaphor; no redundant thesis lines. Resonant ambiguity: has she joined or merely understood? Cost lingers in metallic aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains Vera’s idiosyncratic perceptual signature—magnetic taste, scent-tracking—without head-hop. Prose rhythm modulates: long aurora sentences vs. clipped taste fragments under pressure. Diction stays within her lexicon; no academic register drift. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: fog-woman’s futuristic nostalgia tag is audible. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: sensory verbs carry double duty (taste = knowledge). Varied sentence cadence avoids template. Minor scaffold: “tasted… taste” repetition in adjacent lines (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent (aurora as question, ring as empty north). No purple pile-ups; closing copper image is concise and propulsive. Clean grammar and pronoun track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weather-carriers as living grid stabilizers + arboreal electoral politics + taste-based magnetic navigation. Concept commits fully—no retreat to metaphor. Risky lyric compression paid off by legible closure. Transformation test fails if names swapped, confirming specificity. Aurora-lavender-triad convergence feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
