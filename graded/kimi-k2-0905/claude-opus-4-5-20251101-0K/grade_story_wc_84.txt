<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s drive to decode her father’s frequency is credible and emotionally grounded. The “perpetually surprised” trait surfaces only once, lacking embodiment or cost, so it reads as label-only. Her handing-over of both chips at the end is a micro-choice that crystallizes her shift from search to continuation, earning partial credit. Interiority is concrete when she spots the star-trail alignment; elsewhere it slips toward explanatory summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dome-crack lens projects a living map, conceptually repricing the quest from finding a person to joining a network; the cost is the open road she now must walk. Causal chain is intact: chip fit → lever pull → star-beam map → next coordinates. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by line 12. The lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Observatory stones, dome fractures, and drone spotlight are tactile and specific; the cracked-stone lens is a micro-setting that directly enables the climactic projection. Thermal drone readout and type-matrix chips supply near-future texture without expo dump. Dusk light and “brilliant dimness” mirror the threshold theme, but the phrase itself is used meta-textually rather than filtered through Mira’s perception, a slight POV wobble.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the belonging frequency—is signaled early. One clear tightening: the two chips click into grooves, turning abstract search into literal next-step coordinates; this narrows options and triggers the dome mechanism. Cost is present: father still absent, pilgrim leaves, Mira must keep walking. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word span; no off-stage rescues or lucky coincidences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of networked belonging emerges imagistically via the star-thread map rather than assertion. Subtext lives in the silent hand-off of chips—inheritance as transmission. Final image reweights “home” from geographic to harmonic, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing. The “brilliant dimness” refrain risks thematic echo, but its last use is embedded in action (Mira walking into it) which blunts the说教 edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Detached, atmospheric third-person stays consistent and achieves a lyrical-cognitive texture suited to code-breaking. Sentence rhythm modulates—long reflective cadences contract to staccato drone commands under pressure. Diction stays within Mira’s tech-cartographer lexicon; no register drift. “Perpetually surprised expression she now wore” is the one filter-heavy line; otherwise perception is concrete and body-anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances image or mechanism. No synonym loops or template cadences; metaphors (copper light, static whispers) are spare and coherent. Opening and closing lines are resonant and propulsive. Minor scaffold: “She understood then…” could be deleted, but it occupies only one clause and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Combines ancient astronomy, electromagnetic anomaly mapping, and brass type-matrix chips—an unexpected synthesis that feels specific rather than kit-bashed. The dome cracks forming an optical lens re-energizes a ruined landmark; projection of human constellations literalizes the belonging theme without trope inflation. Not earth-shatteringly novel, but the details interlock cleanly and the final image is memorable.</comment>
