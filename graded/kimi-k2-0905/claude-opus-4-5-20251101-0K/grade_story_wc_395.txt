<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motive—curiosity for deleted truth—supplies steady fuel; pockets of reflective summary and label-cram (“obsession,” “digital fossil”) keep her from the highest band. Interiority is solid on bodies and breath, but her one blunt action—grabbing the patch—trails the strongest micro-choice; more dynamic compromise mid-chase would have lifted pressure. Earned Stasis lands with cost (job, safety, sleep) and is credibly fore-shadowed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: 7-14 pings → Helena breaches vault → warehouse clue → midnight run, each beat foreclosing safer paths. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her sprint crystallizes new hunter/hunted stance; cost is felt—“she began to run.” Minor scaffold (“numbers started appearing…”) and a late patch reveal qualify but don’t sabotage the last image; the before/after pivot is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Missile-silo-come-server-farm anchors every corridor; server racks as “mechanical ghosts,” audio detritus, and the gutted timestamp 7-14 all tie to POV’s cataloguer gaze. Tools—servers, patch, corrupted sectors—shape both discovery and risk; the silo itself charges the final dash (“climbed the stairs toward the surface”). Spatial choreography is clean and economical, never stalls action.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find what the deleted hide”—is signaled by line 6; escalation comes because each 7-14 sighting forces a deeper trespass and higher exposure. One meaningful tightening closes options when she copies the drive and exits security coverage; visible cost (job, freedom) is legible at the final sprint. Coincidence only complicates; pressure builds because her own choices trigger alarms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emergent theme—digital ghosts outlive their erasure—rises from the pattern of persistent 7-14 tags, not a sermon. Patch reprise and the stars-as-servers image cement the repricing without moralizing; closure reframes the silo archive as testimony. One slight theme echo in the final sentence could drop –0.1 but is not heavy enough to deduct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Helena’s cataloguer diction, compressed sentences under vault pressure (“hunted for meaning,” “pounding against her ribs”) keep rhythm distinct. No dialogue to test, so register drift risk is zero. Perceptual signature is sharp throughout: she logs, timestamps, archives, notice gaps others miss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density via noun-verb pairs, minimal scaffold; a single near-loop (“numbers started appearing…”) and one stacked modifier string (“drunken karaoke from parties a decade past”) are forgivable. Simultaneity clean, sentence variety strong; patch and “stars above…like distant servers” land as earned final image, no mixed metaphor near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Social-media deep-archive as dystopian data-graveyard feels fresh; nested linkage of deleted users → Black-ops server cluster → vanished whistleblower fuses tech thriller with noir. Artemis-7 space disaster added as plausible catalyzing myth; combination stakes the claim beyond routine conspiracy plot.</comment>
