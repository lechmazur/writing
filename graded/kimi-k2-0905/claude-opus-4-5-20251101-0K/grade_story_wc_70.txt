<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived; it never complicates her tactics or forces a visible mistake under pressure. The daughter-grief motive lands late and is summarized, not embodied, so the emotional cost feels borrowed rather than earned. Still, her choice to open the tower’s memory bank is cleanly motivated by backstory and crystallizes a believable shift from watcher to participant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bees re-sync while Mira accepts the matchbox’s transfer, proving wonder can outlive power. Causality holds under an accumulative lens—each storm-echo in the tower’s memory literally re-weights the present stakes. The only drag is a 150-word expository pocket that slows ascent to the climax; trimming it would tighten the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tower’s copper veins, phosphorescent moss, and residual charge are not backdrop but toolkit: they supply the literal current that saves the bees and re-charges the “nectar dusk” motif at the end. Spatial choreography is immaculate—door, counter, terminals, vents—every move is trackable. Micro-setting (matchbox, lacquer seams) constrains the final handshake, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—is signaled early and tested when the dying bees force Mira to break her own ritual ledger. Pressure tightens once the humming weakens and the tower’s memory becomes the only remaining power source; the choice to share it costs her sole custodianship, a visible forfeiture. Escalation is steady, single-cycle, and sufficient for 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transfer of custodianship: wonder is not hoarded but electrically passed on, circuit to circuit. The matchbox riddle moves from private cipher to communal map, re-pricing memory as shared current rather than personal relic. No moralizing—just the final image of stars switching on above an open gate, a quiet conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is saturated with metallic taste, ozone, and “nectar dusk” light—never generic. Syntax lengthens during the descent, then fractures into short pulses as bees re-sync, mirroring her held breath. No dialogue clutter; the few spoken lines carry subtext about debt and gift, keeping voice distinct between the two women.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and causal linkage. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; figurative language is spare and storm-earned (“humming resolved into harmony”). The single risk—an extended metaphor of water through broken glass—pays off by foreshadowing the later electric flow, so the image is earned, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lightning tower as memory battery, mechanical bee hive corrupted by EMP, and involuntary truth-telling merge into a fresh myth that feels ancient the moment it’s uttered. The matchbox riddle functions as both tech manual and grief object—an intersection no trope map predicts. Risk-taking is coherent: the speculative frame never buckles under sentiment; instead it re-weights parental loss as electrical stewardship, a synthesis that would collapse if any part were swapped.</comment>
