<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—frugality as spiritual discipline, the silent bargain she strikes with the unknown—yet her contradictory impulses (rationalist/seeker) stay mostly in summary rather than being forced into a single pressured choice. The moment she lifts the tile is the only concrete micro-choice that visibly costs her something (she pockets a three-coin relic that could be confiscated), so the covenant feels earned. Still, the “epiphany” is articulated rather than dramatized in body, keeping her just shy of full-spectrum embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers pattern (magic square, stellar translation, tile) until the final image crystallizes the covenant. Orientation is secure by l. 60; the 17-year orbital payoff is the Conceptual Repricing beat that makes the cost legible—Mira will spend the rest of her career waiting. The only hairline slip is a mild explanatory lull midsentence (“she understood the absurdity…”) that slightly blunts the tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lapis-and-silver tile functions as micro-setting: its physical properties (weight, numerals, portability) constrain the final action—she packs it, sealing her exile wait. Brass telescopes, clerestory slant-light, and ziggurat shadow are filtered through Mira’s astronomer gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or warps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the universe answer?—tightens once: the primes emerge, foreclosing skepticism and locking her into 17-year vigil. The cost is conceptual (lifelong watch) rather than visceral, but still legible. No second reversal is needed; the pattern-deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion reframed as scientific asceticism emerges without sermon: theme grows from her choice to pack a three-coin tile instead of gold. The final image—astronomer walking Babylon’s night with alien orbital in her pocket—reweights faith as data-driven patience. Ambiguity is purposeful: message or coincidence? Reader left in same stance as Mira.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, slyly lyrical (“truth required no gilded frame”), with astronomer’s precision in diction. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Syntax mirrors Mira’s taxonomic mind—parallel clauses cataloging stars, costs, numerals—yet loosens into longer breath at twilight. Filter verbs minimal and motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density; only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“empty observatories…abandoned calculation halls”) slip into mild loop. Metaphors stay coherent—bridge of numbers, breadcrumbs of truth—without purple drift. Final line cadence is ear-tested; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh splice of Babylonian mathematics, Persian palace reboot, and SETI via magic square feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Frugal-woman-as-first-contact is gendered inversion of lone-genius trope, made specific through auction ledger and three-coin tile. Risk—static waiting instead of blast-off—pays off by making endurance the heroic act.</comment>
