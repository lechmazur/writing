<comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—tending life while steeling herself for loss—are dramatized in her kneel-and-wave, not told. The brass-tooth beam is a micro-choice that visibly costs her poise; the returned wave crystallizes a new, fragile relationship. Grandfather’s maxim is cleanly motivated by prior griefs, and the rose-prune promise shows endurance with cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the reciprocal wave reconfigures both solitude and stewardship with felt vulnerability. Causal chain intact—petal drop → memory → beam → returned gesture—each beat tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; harbor, floor, and midnight are anchored before 120 words. Cost is visible in the held breath and the promise of harder pruning next spring.</comment>

<comment>The fire-escape micro-setting constrains every move—rust cans, five-story drop, condemned façade—so even a tomato or a moon-gleam carries stakes. Harbor moonlight is returned to in four variants, each re-weighting isolation or connection. Spatial choreography is clean: distance across alley, third-floor window, downward spiral tracked without drift. Sensory triage favors tactile metal and salt air over visual cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to keep showing up for life when endings keep coming—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: anonymous watcher becomes real, foreclosing her safe spectatorship. Cost is legible—shared visibility risks future eviction or heartbreak—but the tightening is gentle; no tangible resource is lost tonight. Sufficient for this length, yet a shade below high-band visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurrent living-in-death imagery (rose, divorces, memory loss) without moralizing. Final image of “small green kingdom” re-prices the premise: sovereignty is not control but stubborn presence. Subtext operates in silence—two tomatoes taken, one hand raised—never explained. The harbor’s hammered silver refracts private grief into civic scale, giving afterglow beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Marina’s perceptual filter—selective attention to rust, salt, moon flecks. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under the quivering hush; rhythm mirrors respiration. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; diction stays within a lifelong harbor-dweller’s lexicon. Grandfather’s quoted line is the only external voice and is framed as remembered speech, not narrative intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; most sentences perform double duty (e.g., “moonlight turned the water into hammered silver” feeds both harbor and emotional state). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “missing tooth” simile is brief, apt, character-specific. Filter verbs are minimal and justified. Register never drifts into workshop euphony; nouns stay concrete, verbs muscular. Final line cadence re-echoes opening petal-fall, closing the musical arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar lonely-gardener trope is refreshed by illegal tenant angle and locksmith heritage; brass tooth as lantern is a low-tech, trade-specific twist. Synthesis of rose life-cycle and harbor tides feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than plot pyrotechnics—but coherence is high. Would benefit from sharper external jeopardy to reach top originality band.</comment>
