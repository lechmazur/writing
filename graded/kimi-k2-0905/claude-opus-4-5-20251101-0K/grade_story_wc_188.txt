<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-numbed caution versus pyrotechnic daring—are shown in scene through her trembling hands yet daring fuse order; the final choice to keep the singed knot carries visible cost. Grandmother’s return functions as crucible pressure, forcing explicit renunciation of solitude. Micro-choices (humming while loading shells, crouching to decode tile shards) reveal value hierarchy: memory < spectacle < shared wonder. Motive intensifies cleanly: arrival hoping to feel → tower asked to transform grief → dawn carrying fire onward; no stock interiority or label-speak under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn smoke drifting through blooming vines crystallizes the before/after—Elara re-enters world bearing usable ash, path foreclosed of despair. Causal lens holds: mosaic message → ascent → ignition; each beat narrows options until “ignite or retreat.” Cost is legible on-page: the singed knot’s soot on palms, grandmother’s admitted cruelty, Elara’s dawn departure with burden of next audience. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) secured by line 10; no lapses; transitions cleanly two-shard (courtyard → tower).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fortress tiles and night-blooming jasmine constrain attention and later refract fire-light; micro-setting (kerosene knot, her boot soles on mosaic shards) repeatedly handled. Sensory hierarchy obeys pyrotechnician bias: smell of jasmine → ambient drafts → low cloud ceiling as canvas. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from portcullis → disrupted mosaic → eastern wall → 104 tower steps. Weather (starless cloud-velvet) directly enables the spectacle; environment charges final smoke-veined vines image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question></grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy hopelessness via light—signaled opening line; meaningful tightening occurs when grandmother demands she burn brighter, not dimmer; live option to retreat inward is foreclosed. Escalation follows accumulative pattern: each shell compounds communal awe, re-weighting private grief into shared wonder. Visible prices: exposed position on battlement, consumption of relic knot, social cost of reopened family wound. No coincidence; spectacle success emerges solely from her sequential ignition choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question></grade><comment>Theme emerges as grief transformed to communal wonder through craft; no overt thesis stated. Fire/memory dialectic charged by closing image of smoke in blooming vines—life-death-life cycle re-priced without moral. Subtext in gesture: grandmother returning knot = return of agency. Insight earned through tactile struggle with powders, not sermon. Ambiguity preserved—audience sees only beauty, Elara carries residual ash—offering plausible counter-readings on whether healing is real or iterative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question></grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual signature—pyrotechnician’s lens notices drafts, tile micro-patterns, explosive timings. Syntax lengthens during calm, fragments under ignition: “Flame leaped like something liberated.” No head-hopping; grandmother’s interior accessed only through Elara read of wrinkles and voice. Dialogue minimal but distinct: grandmother’s cadence carries old gravity/mischief, Elara’s reply whispers—mirroring their generational roles. Rhythm modulates with fuse sequence, accelerating heart-beat fashion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</question></grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances image or pressure (“vines…cascaded…ramparts…petals opening like tiny mouths”). Metaphors consistent—fire = liberation, mosaic = memory—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops/scaffold; each descriptor adds novel texture (bruised purples, velvet black). Read-aloud rhythm breathes, then accelerates with launch cadence. Minor alliteration (“gravel…portcullis”) feels voice-driven, not decorative. Closure sentence clean, propulsive: “She tucked the singed knot…tomorrow, she would walk again.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question></grade><comment>Familiar grief-to-art trope refreshed via fireworks craft specifics (wind read via skin, cloud ceiling as canvas) and mosaic-message device; premise not radically new but detail-set specific. Risk of dead-relative motivation mitigated by grandmother’s fake death twist and communal outcome. Fortress-bloom concept offers fresh visual metaphor. Final reprise of smoke among flowers feels inevitable yet not clichéd. Transformation test passes: swap to painter or musician would require rebuilding technical stakes.</comment>
