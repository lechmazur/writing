<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Margaret’s interiority is sharp—burned hands tracing the pillbox, the cheek scar pulling in cold—but the decisive turn (accepting Viktor’s file) is under-motivated: eleven years of exile distilled into one calm touch on his shoulder. The pillbox and scar anchor her, yet the Choice beat lacks a visible cost on the page; she neither hesitates nor sacrifices anything we feel. Competence is high, struggle muted; the emotional arithmetic is almost too clean for a woman who once crawled from a crematorium.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: snow-melt cipher → dawn walk → sanatorium → acceptance of file, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is Earned Stasis: she refuses forgiveness yet carries the betrayal forward, cost legible in the final image of her “carrying the weight.” Orientation is clean by line 6; no teleporting props. The missing beat is the instant she pivots from vengeance to stewardship—summarized, not dramatized, blunting the Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bluff’s silver mist and retreating snow double as map and memory, constraining her route and reading time. Micro-setting—the pillbox in her pocket—functions as tactile compass, its engraved motto returning as the last thought. Sensory economy is excellent: cold tightening scar tissue, snow speaking in cipher. One slip: “white building against white snow” risks monochrome blankness, but the oxygen tubes and wheelchair inside quickly re-anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she answer Viktor’s coded plea?—is signaled early and tightens when “Watched. Come alone. Dawn” surfaces. Agency is continuous: decoding, walking, entering, accepting file. The tightening moment is the folder hand-off; it narrows her future to re-entry into the game. Cost is conceptual (she’ll carry treason’s knowledge) rather than visceral; a hair below high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fixing what’s broken” emerges through snowmelt as living palimpsest: some breaks stay beautiful, some need carrying. Subtext lives in silence—the shoulder touch that isn’t forgiveness—and in the pillbox motto returned without comment. No thematic sermonizing; the final image reweights the premise. Minor echo: Viktor’s line “unused courage” restates the prompt concept, a 0.2 nudge off perfect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Margaret; perceptual signature is grim sensorium—burn scars, cold metal, silver hush. Rhythm flexes with terrain: long climb sentences, then clipped sanatorium white. No head-hop; Viktor’s thoughts remain opaque. Filter verbs minimal; diction within her lexicon. One register drift: “vouchsafe” sounds donnish for a field agent, but it’s Viktor’s word, not hers, so tolerated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and winter-hard consonants propel descent; no scaffold loops. Metaphors are spare and integrated (“silver tide,” “map of the fire”). One mixed image: “earth beginning its slow lean into warmth” personifies orbital mechanics, but the lyric pattern is taught early and repaid at closure. Information density high; each paragraph advances knowledge or terrain. Clean copy; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: snowmelt as Cold-War cipher, spy-exile turned reluctant archivist. Burned scout reading glacier Morse is not a trope I’ve seen. Risk is quiet—no shootout—but stakes feel large because the data will outlive bodies. Derivative echo: dying mentor in wheelchair recalls Le Carré’s Control, but the daughter-medical-bill motive twists it. Specificity of pillbox motto and scar map rescues from generic.</comment>
