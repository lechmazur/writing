<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s skeptical lens stays vivid—her boots “leaving dusty footprints” while she clocks her own need for meaning—but the interior shift from debunker to believer is confessed rather than embodied; the tearful pilgrim beside her does more emotional work than she does in the final beat. Still, her chemistry-to-anthropology intellect gives sharp, idiosyncratic notice of the amber and the cost of renouncing her former papers feels real.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens teaches its pattern early—each coordinate a preserved shard—and tightens when Mira sees the fly as “a bridge between worlds,” landing on a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her entire academic stance; the cost is palpable in her quiet “yes” that forecloses the safety of pure skepticism. All causality is coherent under the inferred lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed tower, the overgrown sculpture path, and the amber itself are used as micro-settings that literally steer who can enter and what can be touched; the spring light break at the end re-illuminates the same stones, charging the closure image. Density is selective—“bronze quiet” keeps the palette tight—while spatial choreography stays clean across six silent bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will Mira keep her skeptical armor—tightens once when the amber’s message redefines her former papers as “artificial” pilgrimages themselves; the cost is her publicly changed mind, but the beat is single and internal, so escalation is more accretive than spiked. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<comment>The piece’s thesis about “home as continuity, not place” emerges wholly through the fly-in-amber image and Mira’s surrendered skepticism; no character ever utters a moral. The reweighting lands as genuine wisdom because it is tied to her professional forfeiture and the conceptual cost of accepting alien sacredness.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mira with a perceptual signature—“she called it an artificial pilgrimage”—and modulates into lyrical compression at the height: “luminous now, lit from within.” No head-hopping; syntax mirrors her analytical bent then softens into reverence without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only minor scaffold (“they had all learned...”) and one mixed metaphor (“signal had changed everything”) appear, neither touching closure. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested strong, with purposeful repetition that teaches the pattern; information density is high yet breathable.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<comment>The “alien coordinates to fossil sites” premise feels fresh, and the fly-amber twist retroactively reframes every prior skeptical paper; risk is taken by keeping six pilgrims silent, turning the ending into a collective hush rather than speech. Specificity of Kepler-442b and molecular signature grounds the concept in non-generic science.</comment>
