<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her paradoxical longing to “find the beginning in every ending” is dramatized through the micro-choice of reversing the tower’s circuitry and surrendering to the shard of hush. The Hollywood star fragment warms against her chest, an embodied contradiction of anonymous fame that charges her final weeping beat. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the single-POV arc earns a credible renunciation of voice-for-voicelessness with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she discards filters, the array pulls the cosmic silence inward; therefore she weeps in a reconfigured stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the image of towers that “had finally learned to listen.” Cost is legible in the irrevocable shift from broadcaster to receiver and in the fragment’s warming anonymity. A hairline slip: the phrase “she would find the beginning” projects future certainty, slightly softening the on-page finality required for 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gorge-mist, rusted ladder, and serenely electric air are filtered through Mira’s signal-interpreter gaze; every descriptor doubles as atmospheric pressure and tool context. The towers’ skeleton status and the perigee are not tourist lists but causal constraints—proximity moon enables reception. Micro-setting success: the corroded console’s dials and the warming star fragment constrain her tuning choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body or prop positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access cosmic silence—tightens when filter-removal narrows her option back to zero: either embrace the wordless hush or fail. Agency drives the escalation: she physically reverses amplification cascade, stakes her life on a fall from the platform, and pays with the loss of human voice-centric meaning. Cost is visible on-page: the scream-shaped static collapses into weighted silence that cloaks her shoulders. Enough for 8.1, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inversion of broadcast→receive; no abstract thesis is stated. The Hollywood star fragment’s anonymous fame reweights the idea that endings equal erasure, culminating in the non-literal image of towers learning to listen. Final line “It only changed frequency” offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central paradox. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing detected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Mira’s perceptions—technical diction (“amplification cascade,” “cosmic silence”) remains within her interpretive lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses during ascent, staccato fragments while tuning, then hush-long sentences at climax. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she thought”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are internally coherent—“gorge yawned like a mouth that had forgotten how to close” sets the silence motif without mixed vehicle clash. Zero loops, no synonym churn; scaffold-free. Opening and final lines are sharp, propulsive. A single near-purple phrase “serenely electric” is pattern-taught early and pays off, forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The inversion of a shout-city into a listening-city feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Celestial signal interpreter is a rare occupation; coupling it with the Walk-of-Fame relic gives anonymous fame a concrete hook. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but coherence holds. Slight deduction for recognizable post-apocalyptic radio-trope; the specificity of “shard of hush” lifts it above cliché.</comment>
