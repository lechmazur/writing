<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly embodied (“pressure embraced her transformed body like a welcome”) and her contradictory impulses—yearning for the deep versus residual loyalty to Jonas—are staged in a single, compressed beat. The renunciation of land life is earned through the scrimshaw’s causal trigger and the whale’s call, so the cost is legible. Status crucible with Jonas is brief but charged: his “combative tenderness” forces her to articulate the final goodbye. Dock-worker grace is shown, not told, through “fluid, almost choreographed” loading memories, grounding occupational specificity without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the island’s fade reweights the premise that surrendering violence also surrenders the surface world, and Mira’s crossing carries the visible cost of never returning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—whale-song and glowing scrimshaw lines tighten the texture until the cadence shift of “Then she dove” detaches the old life. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“sublittoral fringe”) and the Treaty’s timeline is cued before transformation; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: its twilight pressure literally enables her gilled lungs and propels the final dive. Whale and bone scrimshaw are handled tactilely—vibration, glow, warming palm—so the “tools” constrain tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices shimmer, sand, pressure, not tourist visuals. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tidal pool to drop-off to island threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—find the disappearing island or accept land-bound alienation—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each whale call thickens the scrimshaw map, tightening options until only the abyss remains. The island’s vanishing clause creates a visible price—once she enters, exit is foreclosed—so cost is on-page. No coincidence; the whale’s approach is triggered by her holding the artifact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: surrendering violence also means surrendering the false body/land identity. The island’s fade reprises the Treaty’s vanishing clause, repricing “peace” as irrevocable exile. Subtext in Jonas’s handshake—“fighting against the goodbye”—carries the human cost of that peace without stating it. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image is action, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly interior to Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is aqueous—“dream caught between tides,” “surface world had become a distant shimmer”—mirroring her transformation. Diction stays within plausible dock-worker lexicon until lyrical final paragraph, justified by epiphany. Dialogue lines are sparse but voice-differentiated: Jonas’s roughness versus Mira’s new resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is rhythmic and compressed: “She had spent her life detaching herself from her own nature” folds backstory into one clean line. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—“pressure embraced her transformed body like a welcome”—no mixed vehicles. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image: “let it carry her home.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusion of post-violence utopia with personal body-horror transformation feels non-obvious; the Treaty’s sci-fi rule is revealed through consequence, not exposition. Disappearing island trope is refreshed by locating it in the abyss and tying disappearance to the peace clause. Dock-worker-to-merrow arc is specific to maritime labor kinesthetics. Risk: lyric dive ending could have drifted abstract, but cost is anchored by Jonas’s terrestrial loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Setup: “grace” named in paragraph 2; Development: cargo-loading memory justifies aquatic fluidity; Closure: her graceful dive propels the final image. Causal pressure: bodily grace enables the tail-propelled escape. Cost: abandons the dock where that grace was first noticed. Irreplaceable—no other occupation supplies the same kinesthetic logic.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Setup: grandmother deathbed hand-off; Development: unlocks Jonas’s grief, turning him from bystander to emotional anchor; Closure: glows new lines under whale call, catalyzing dive. Two distinct tactile beats plus causal map function. Removing it collapses both relationship pressure and navigation logic.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Setup: grandmother whisper; Development: vanishing clause tightens stakes—once found, island disappears, foreclosing return; Closure: island already fading as she crosses threshold, reweighting peace as irreversible exile. Drives the final cost. Cannot swap for generic utopia without losing the Treaty echo.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Setup: scrimshaw pressed to palm; Development: unlocks Jonas’s guarded heart, forcing raw confession that pressures Mira to admit goodbye; Closure: Jonas’s “combative tenderness” reappears in final handshake, showing his unlocked vulnerability persists. Enables emotional crucible beat. No other object could plausibly melt a dock worker’s armor this quickly.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Setup: “detached herself from her own nature”; Development: sheds scale-like chains underwater; Closure: final “let it carry her home” detaches from land identity forever. Three distinct beats. Detachment is the physical and emotional engine of the entire arc; swap would erase transformation logic.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Setup: whale-song map carved into scrimshaw; Development: each call etches new glowing lines, tightening direction; Closure: whale circles the island, vocalizing welcome. Mechanics matter—song literally draws the map. Cannot substitute generic siren or dolphin without breaking因果链.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Setup: named in opening sentence; Development: pressure and light levels enable gill function and tail propulsion; Closure: island appears only within this fringe’s twilight zone. Spatial boundary creates the unique threshold. Removing it collapses the entire underwater geography.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Setup: Treaty of Still Waters referenced; Development: peace clause explains why pirates can still exist yet violence cannot, allowing scrimshaw inheritance; Closure: island’s fade mirrors the irreversibility of the Treaty. Timeframe is the conceptual hinge that justifies non-violent surrender of land body. Later arrival than other elements but transforms prior material.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Setup: dreams of depths she’d never seen; Development: tail growth dramatizes the conflict between hiding and embracing; Closure: “stopped fighting the current” crystallizes embrace. Desire propels every beat and the final renunciation cost. Cannot swap without nullifying transformation stakes.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>Setup: Jonas’s handshake “combative in its tenderness”; Development: Mira mirrors it in goodbye beat; Closure: underwater peace converts combat into surrender while tenderness remains. Tone modulates from dockside roughness to abyssal acceptance, charging the final image. Essential to emotional arc; removal flattens the Treaty’s human cost.</question>
