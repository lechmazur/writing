<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is rich—ink-stained hands, golden-ratio obsession, the shiver of borrowed grief—but her moment of “transposed empathy” is announced more than dramatized. The drowned-poet personality never speaks or acts; we’re told it “intensifies” rather than seeing a contradictory micro-choice. The earned cost is present (she smiles with “his mouth and her own heart”), yet the causality feels lightly sketched because the turn arrives via typographic epiphany rather than a pressured decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-loss thickens atmosphere, halo pulses accumulate meaning, and the final page reweights the core equation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mira rewrites her life’s formula into “harmony discovered,” a genuine before/after. A minor orientation wobble: “between vanishing stars” is poetry first, spatial anchor second; still, the pattern pays off when the last star’s blink synchronizes with the press’s cadence, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz floor, crystalline starlight, and the halo fragment’s warmth are tactile tools that constrain action—Mira sets type barefoot on cold metal, halo heat dictates when she reads. The press itself becomes micro-setting: its mechanical rhythm mirrors stellar pulse, fusing cosmos and craft. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific: a typesetter who “reads” light as musical notation. One tenth off 9+ because the exterior plateau geography remains vaguely moored; no wind, breath, or bodily spatial relation to the open sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—“finish her equation before the last star vanishes”—are lyrical but legible; each dissolution tightens available light for her calculations. The single meaningful escalation occurs when the halo blazes and rewrites the page: ambiguity becomes method, grief fuses with hope, foreclosing her prior quest for a solitary answer. Cost is visible: she trades certainty for composite emotion, demonstrated by ink on her hands and the final smile. Agency is quiet (she keeps printing) yet transformative under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: meaning generated through relational interference patterns rather than solved formulae. Subtext resides in typographic metaphors—letters “cold and certain,” ink that “shifts meaning”—so the medium is the message. Final image of grief/hope as unresolvable chord avoids moralizing. Slight deduction for an almost-epiphany that leans on abstract nouns (“lucid turbulence,” “infinite dance”) rather than concrete after-image; still, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is压ological, compressed, rhythmically inked: “sky hemorrhaging light,” “time… thick as old grief.” Syntax mirrors typesetter’s precision—parallel noun phrases, metallic consonants. Filter verbs are avoided; perception is direct: “She picked up the fragment now, feeling its warmth.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon—she would know “asymptote,” “compositor’s tray.” Under peak stress, clauses shorten to single hammer beats: “Transposed empathy. The term surfaced.”—a taught pattern that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty—world-build and interior math. Figurative language rarely overruns: only two consecutive metaphors in high-pressure zone (“loss multiplied… asymptote”), justified by narrator’s math-obsession. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or concept. Minor scaffold: “the mathematics resolved” echoes earlier “trying to understand the mathematics,” but repetition is thematic reprise, not churn. Closing line achieves Charged Poise with impeccable cadence—“pressing meaning into existence one transposed emotion at a time”—ending on stressed monosyllable like a press kiss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses celestial apocalypse with artisanal printing into a fresh conceit; stellar death as ink-limit is non-obvious. “Transposed empathy” transforms familiar body-swap trope into atmospheric math. Risky lyric accumulation could have slid into vagueness, yet specificity of letterpress procedure grounds the metaphysics. Final inversion—equation becomes harmony, not solution—feels inevitable in hindsight, earning the +0.2 risk bonus. No derivative template shadow; imagery is singular.</comment>
