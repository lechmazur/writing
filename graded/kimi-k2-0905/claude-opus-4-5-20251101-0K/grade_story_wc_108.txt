<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—fear vs stunt training—and the final stand is embodied. Yet the “vulnerability is power” pivot is declared, not dramatized in body, trimming the felt cost. Still, micro-choices (shaking hands offered as weapon) keep motives coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sandra confesses, Marla records, future opens—cost is the lifelong terror now named. Causal chain holds from shell → cast → confession; one minor ellipsis (how recording legally secures justice) but not gaping. Drive lens is Causal, intact through final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Roofless library under star weight is more than backdrop—mirrors exposure and forces standoff in open sight. Salt-ruined astronomy texts ground the spatial choreography; every shelf and wind-groan is filtered through Marla’s hyper-vigilance. Micro-setting of the shell-as-recorder constrains the reveal beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity vs captor—tightens once: Marla turns disclosure weapon back on Sandra. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: decrypt cast → summon to ruin → trade shell for confession. Cost is Sandra’s collapse and Marla’s unrecoverable years; option space narrows to public truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Betrayal reframed as liberation emerges through image (rusted roofless library = torn identity) rather than pronouncement. Final shell hand-off reweights forgiveness as tactical, not sentimental. Theme avoids moral balancing; complicity and damage remain asymmetrical, giving complexity room.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Free indirect diction stays close to a stunt-performer’s sensory ledger—“spatial awareness, timing, sequences.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, clipped fragments under confrontation. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Dialogue sparse but carries subtext of ownership vs personhood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density—“rusted library had no roof, only stars pressing down like cold witnesses” does three jobs in one stroke. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-scene (“she noticed she carried”) but isolated. No mixed metaphors; occasional adjective duplication (“rusted” 3×) but not to opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kidnapped-stunt-double-with-mirror-phobia is fresh synthesis; shell-encapsulated voice message gives uncanny tech without sci-fi. Plot hinges on child self-documentation via cast—believable, non-gimmicky. Risky roofless setting pays off thematically. Familiar emotional core (stolen identity) is re-angled through profession-specific competence.</comment>
