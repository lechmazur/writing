<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—her vow of silence versus the need to speak to the dead keeper—are dramatized in the spiral climb and the moment she breaks the seal; every micro-choice (touching the sea glass, rebuilding the cairn, adding her letter) is tethered to her father-taught code and costs her the last scrap of protective distance. The interiority is concrete—“the particular quality of silence that settles into abandoned places”—and the embodied tremor of decision is legible without label-speak. The final renunciation (voice reclaimed, chain accepted) forecloses her former life as the reticent courier and is earned by the accumulated weight of read strangers’ griefs. The only minor lapse is “she understood then why the chain had been created,” which edges toward interpretive summary rather than lived deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the sea glass atop the rebuilt cairn crystallizes both literal task (protect) and metaphysical duty (remember), reconfiguring Maren’s identity with undeniable cost—she leaves the lighthouse changed, no longer merely the ferrywoman but the chain’s new vessel. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each letter read thickens the emotional density until the dark lantern room becomes a pressure chamber of shared humanities. Causality is intact: the cairn’s unknown spiral pattern triggers her deduction, which in turn triggers her voice and the final sealing of the envelope. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and re-anchored each sensory pass up the stairs.</comment>

<comment>The lantern room itself—rust, dead lens, dust motes swimming like underwater creatures—functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: she must physically handle the glass and stones to rewrite the keeper’s code. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a skipper notices “handrail flecks,” bird-strike evidence, oil smells absorbed over years. Spatial choreography is flawless; the spiral stairs, gallery, and lamp base are never lost even in darkness. The only tiny slip is the generic “fractured prisms” phrase, a touch postcard, but it is immediately re-filtered through her marine eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the chain—tightens when the last receiver is dead; escalation is the accretion of voices she cannot unread. The cost is visceral: silence forfeited, solitude breached, future routes now bound to lighthouses she once only supplied. Agency is accretive rather than explosive: each letter she finishes narrows her possible stance until speech becomes the only unsaid act. One could wish for a sharper external jeopardy (storm, dwindling fuel), but the internal pressure cooker suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the communal bottle-necked warmth against oceanic indifference; no character ever names it. The sea glass’s faint glow reprices the entire premise: what seemed a relic of nostalgia becomes the new filament of an unlit lamp. Subtext is carried in gesture—stacked stones, unsealed envelope—never sermon. The final image refuses moral symmetry: some lights never go out, yet she must sail away, burdened, into unlit waters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: salt-logged, stone-code literate, allergic to easy speech. Syntax is compressed but never to opacity—“cargo more precious than oil” is skipper idiom, not poetic inflation. The only micro-drift is “quality of silence that settles into abandoned places,” a hair generic, but it is immediately re-particularized by her bodily tread. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for the climb, staccato fragments when she finally writes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative layer is spare—dust motes “like underwater creatures” is the single extended metaphor and it earns its keep by marrying sea to air. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are muscular—“she climbed,” “she rebuilt,” “she sealed.” Opening line is hook and anchor; final line is image that recharges the entire lattice. Copy-clean: no typos, tense drift, or pronoun wobble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The anonymous confessional chain passed only among lighthouse keepers is a fresh cultural invention; the cairn code specifics (three flat=safe, pointed=return, spiral of seven=protect) particularize it beyond gimmick. Sea glass as portable filament transforms familiar trope of ghost-keeper into posthumous collaboration rather than horror. Risk is taken in choosing accumulative interior stakes over stormy externals, yet coherence is preserved. The piece could sit beside contemporary oceanic fabulists without blushing.</comment>
