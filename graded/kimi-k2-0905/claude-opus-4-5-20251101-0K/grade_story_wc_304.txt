<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s mortician-beautician duality is concrete: she “applied foundation to skin she had kissed as a child,” a single gesture that fuses love, craft, and death. The interior contradiction—comforting the living by dressing the dead—drives her lucid stillness and the climactic decision to trap her mother’s spark. Embodied emotion is precise: the emerald burns then pulses against her sternum, a felt cost that forecloses her prior detachment. Only the mother remains off-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the sole weakness is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “threshold of stillness” phrasing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emerald becomes a portable afterlife, reweighting Mira’s work from cosmetic to sacramental. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each auroral pulse thickens the static until pattern recognition is possible, then the pattern vanishes, leaving the stone as charged residue. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“skyborne grotto suspended among the clouds”) and the dream logic is taught early, waiving any penalty. The final image—“bearing her mother home”—pays the persistent constraint: she must now live carrying the captured frequency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto is not backdrop but instrument: ice walls “catch and scatter” aurora, turning light into a sieve Mira must read. Micro-setting—the emerald chip—literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is mortician-cold: visual precision first, then the burn of stone against skin, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → lift → press → descend, each motion tracked against dissolving ice. One hairline slip: “clouds parted beneath her” risks physical impossibility, but the dream contract already licenses it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seizing the last spark before cosmic erasure—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the static’s pattern begins to fade. Escalation is textural: aurora intensifies, static thins, time compresses to “perhaps minutes.” The tightening forces the infusion act and costs her prior emotional neutrality; the price is legible as the emerald sears flesh. No reversal, but the deepening suffuses her future work with sacramental dread—an earned, visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges only through incident: beauty as rearguard action against absolute erasure. The emerald’s transformation from grave fragment to living beacon reconfigures “beauty” from illusion to conservation. No moral is stated; the final image of wearing “captured radiance” lets the reader feel the oxymoron of portable eternity. Subtext operates in silence—no mention of afterlife doctrine—leaving the metaphysics charged but unpinned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is mortician-poetic: precise, cool, tactile. Syntax lengthens during aurora reading, then fragments as the stone burns—“then blazed with its own inner fire”—mirroring perceptual strain. No dialogue, so naturalism test is waived. Diction stays within a mortician’s lexicon (“wax and pigment”) until lifted by auroral mysticism, a register shift that reads as expansion rather than breach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, no filler, every sentence advances image or stake. Opening line anchors vocation and metaphysics in one stroke; final line recharges “radiant hush” as lived condition. Metaphors are continent-wide yet accurate—“veins of living light”—and never repeat. Information density is surgical: one clause can span years (“styled hair she had once braided during thunderstorms”) without losing immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mortician practice with auroral soul-capture is fresh synthesis; no template precedes it. Risk—lyric stillness in place of plot reversals—pays off because the static-pattern mechanics are taught early and charged at closure. Transformation test fails if renamed: the specificity of embalming craft is irreplaceable. The emerald’s re-pricing from grave relic to portable eternity feels inevitable yet un-guessable.</comment>
