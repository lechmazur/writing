<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—dust on her palms, the orchid surviving in a cracked pot—yet the “strip needless drama” mandate stays verbal, never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The decision to pocket the slide is the closest to action, but it arrives without prior friction or forfeiture, so the arc leans contemplative rather than crucible-forged. Emotional stakes are felt, but no path is foreclosed; the ending’s humility is atmospheric, not paid for by a renunciation we witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—dust, scales, starlight as filtered residue—and holds to the final image of the blooming orchid, achieving a Charged Poise reconfiguration. Orientation is clean within 60 words; causality is internal and recursive rather than event-driven, fitting the lyric mode. Closure cost is implied—she accepts demolition and takes only one slide—but because the earlier “strip drama” goal never meets an opposing force that tests it, the change feels gentle, not decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse shards, sediment layers, and refracted light through broken roof panels are tactile, specific, and filtered through Mira’s scientific gaze; the butterfly-slide drawer functions as micro-setting that constrains her final selection. Sensory economy is excellent—smell of drowned things, crunch of glass under boot—each detail doing double duty as emotional echo. The orchid at the end is a perfect object-image reprise, reweighting the stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: entropy, flood residue, and maternal absence tighten the emotional field. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes gradual change governs both stars and grief, narrowing her stance from scientific analysis to humble acceptance. No external antagonist or reversible stakes appear, but the accretive pattern itself supplies sufficient tension under the Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, visible in her decision to leave the structure to demolition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring particulate imagery—dust, scales, stellar residue—showing that all perception arrives pre-filtered by loss and time. No character states the thesis aloud; the final orchid image reweights the premise, offering wordless consolation. Subtext resides in silence: Mira never speaks to the absent mother, yet every shattered pane is a missed goodbye. The moral complexity is intact—acceptance is not triumph, merely endurance with grace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira’s neutron-star lexicon—“spectral analyses,” “chitin architecture”—without leaking into authorial explanation. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, staccato fragments (“She knelt.”) under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice carries the entire melodic load; the prose succeeds in sounding like a scientist learning to feel. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied through gloved fingers and light-split vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety is musical, no template cadence; each paragraph passes the cut test. Metaphors are disciplined—“dust motes swirled in columns of gold”—and never mixed. One minor loop: “dust accumulated… how dust accumulated” in adjacent sentences costs −0.2, but it does not touch the final image. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, anchoring voice and resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The neutron-star / butterfly-scale synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, a fresh angle on grief-as-entropy without sentimental shortcuts. Risk is taken in eschewing plot for lyric accretion; the gamble pays off because the pattern is taught early and recharged at the end. No familiar plot template is echoed; the premise is not transformable without collapsing its central metaphor. Specificity of preserved wing scales as cosmic dust is the indelible detail that secures memorability.</comment>
