<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—museum-eloquence against grotto-despair—is lived in every gesture; the emerald lens pressed to a child’s bread is a perfect micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The ache of preservation is embodied, not labeled. No epiphany is declared; instead, the final “perfect preservation of form” joke lets us feel the cost of endurance. The only bar to 8+ is that the children remain largely undifferentiated, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the bread-letters become sacred relics, the waterfall’s song reconfigured from prison to guardian. Causality holds—because the beekeeper stays away, therefore Mira re-casts the custom as resistance, and the lens re-weights its meaning in the final beat. The lens ambiguity test is passed; the accumulative pattern (absence → bread → lens → laughter) is taught by 25 % and lands with felt cost. A hairline slip: “three seasons since his last visit” is the first temporal anchor, arriving after the 120-word orientation window, but the disorientation is later paid off by the thaw metaphor, so only a −0.1 internal deduction.</comment>

<comment>The waterfall is not backdrop but acoustic fate; its roar silences speech and forces the tactile bread-code. The emerald lens’s green skew is a micro-setting that literally re-sees pigment, constraining how Mira validates survival. Spatial choreography is immaculate: observation ledge → carved stairs → communal kitchen → oven → lens-to-bread inspection. Sensory economy narrows to yeast-steam and wet-stone dread under threat, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cultural extinction—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when honey stores near depletion force the bread-lesson to become the last line of defense. One meaningful deepening: the custom flips from refugee nostalgia to active manuscript-preservation tactic. Agency is endurance rather than triumph; the cost is the children’s innocence (they laugh without grasping last-loaf stakes). No reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the pattern’s intensification is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of museum and cave: curation is no longer display but covert salvage, bread as illuminated manuscript. The final joke on “cultural continuity” is sub-textual, not declarative, and reweights the emerald lens from elite spectacle to survival tool. Ambiguity lingers: will the waterfall become tomb or archive? No moral is sermoned; the dread scent of rosewater + wet stone carries the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is historian-poet: Latinate clauses (“historically oriented fragments”) colliding with grotto grit, mirroring Mira’s bifurcated mind. Perceptual signature is exact—she diagnoses pigments through a theater relic while inhaling yeast and doom. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for waterfall drone, staccato for children’s giggles. No head-hop; distance stays close-third throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the throat of oblivion” does triple metaphoric work without purple drift. Only one scaffold pair detected—“distant memory” immediately followed by “memory unfiltered by water”—a micro-loop worth −0.2. Otherwise sentences perform two or three jobs (image + motion + metaphor). Opening and final lines are ear-tested; cadence accelerates into the laugh-beat then subsides with waterfall reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The beekeeper-as-timekeeper conceit freshens exile trope; bread-as-alphabet rescues both culinary and linguistic extinction in one stroke. Risk is taken by making endurance, not escape, the victory—yet coherence holds. Slight deduction for echoing “bread as sacred text” motif prevalent in recent diaspora fiction; still, the opera-glass twist and mineral-paint future keep it particular.</comment>
