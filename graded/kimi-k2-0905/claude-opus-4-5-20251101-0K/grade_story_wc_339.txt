<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Eleanor’s grief-hardened composure is rendered in concrete, embodied beats—“her gloved hand trembled,” “breath the only sound”—that show her quietly analytic nature under pressure. The interior contradiction between scholarly detachment and submerged longing is sustained without diagnostic speak, and the final micro-choice to surface with the globe, not abandon it, crystallizes her earned shift from clutching to carrying. The losses are not just listed; they torque her risk calculus, making the acceptance of the captain’s lesson credible. Cost is visible: she will keep the globe’s secret for herself, paying the price of public silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each artifact (drowned shelves, coral-inked pages, snow-globe storm) layers density until the captain’s pages reweight Eleanor’s premise—letting go is not loss but navigation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the globe sits in her palm, its eternal tempest now re-valued as buoyant, not anchoring. Cost is legible in the final image—“ready to break through”—where surfacing equals exposure to a world that will demand reports, yet she will withhold the private physics she learned. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken library is not backdrop but constraint: shelving becomes obstacle, coral-choked law books force route recalculation, the captain’s desk survives as mahogany island. Sensory hierarchy follows Eleanor’s scientific gaze—she catalogs anemones swaying “like displaced librarians,” notices chemistry-quirk preservation—so detail never stalls momentum. The snow globe functions as micro-setting that charges closure; its intact glass and internal storm literalize the captain’s physics and give her a portable scale-model of surrender. Spatial choreography is clean; submersible, desk, shelf, globe track without impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she internalize a physics of release?—tightens once: the captain’s pages force her to confront that surrender requires force, not resignation. Agency remains hers: she decides to secure the globe, thereby accepting the private cost of public silence. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal: each drowned artifact layers the stakes of carrying versus abandoning knowledge. Felt price is on-page: she will return to“reports and lectures” but has already forfeited the right to speak the deepest finding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the sea’s indifference transforms into a teacher of anti-gravity grief. The snow globe’s eternal storm re-priced from kitsch to compass embodies the conceptual repricing—release is navigation, not loss. No moralizing final sentence; the resonant image of sunlit surface awaiting her breakout lets the reader feel the changed weight. Complexity is honored: the dead stay dissolved, love persists as molecular spacing, and the cost is silence, not transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Eleanor’s scientific perceptual signature—“cross-referencing old blueprints,” “microscopic sea life”—without POV leakage. Syntax lengthens under contemplative pressure, then compresses at lift-off:“ready to break through.” No dialogue, so voice texture is carried by interior metaphor that remains within her lexicon (navigation, chemistry, physics). Register does not drift into academic edgewear; diction stays marine and tactile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with depth changes: long sentences for descent, staccato fragments for the globe retrieval. Information density is high—“books had become coral and knowledge had transmuted into calcium deposits” does triple world/character/time work. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime. Minor paraphrase loop at“she thought of…” repeated three times; does not touch closure but keeps this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Amelia Earhart’s discovery with a drowned Enlightenment library feels inevitable only here; the parallel between found planes and found philosophies freshens both. The snow globe as sealed storm-in-perpetuity is specific enough to feel irreplaceable; swap it for any relic and the physics lesson collapses. Risk: ending on quiet surfacing rather than triumphant display could have deflated, yet the charge is shifted onto the globe’s private eternity, not the external reception. Synthesis of grief physics and maritime archaeology is non-obvious yet coherent.</comment>
