<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marguerite’s interior contradiction—grief that must be shaped yet never vanishes—is dramatized through the rhythmic micro-choices of carving, palms warming, tea steam rising; each beat externalizes the same contained fear Viktor once wore. The endurance of continuing the studio, teaching others, carving another lion is earned by 27 years of watching, so the final quiet “perhaps this had always been enough” lands as credible renunciation rather than self-help tag. No diagnostic label-speak; even “grief” is kept physical. Flaw: late-single mention of “students” never presses her in scene, so status dynamics stay hypothetical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return (kettle pitch, rain code, wood grain) thickens the same dominant stake—how to contain absence—until the final cup-steam image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: options narrow to “enough,” cost felt in the ache of joints, the rough unfinished lion. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words. Micro-turn at “Perhaps this was enough” re-weights prior repetitions without causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skylight-rain functions as micro-setting that constrains attention: droplets lens the sky, decide when she looks up, mark elapsed time against kettle. Ash blank, chair leather, copper pipes are handled, warmed, occupied—objects become tactile containers for emotion. Weather never decorative; October rust palette is absorbed into brick and sawdust so environment and internal state are indivisible. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—transmute shapeless grief into holdable form—signaled in paragraph 1 and deepens through each carving stroke. One meaningful cadence shift: kettle climbs from silence toward whistle, metering the hour; moment of “enough” arrives just before full cry, foreclosing the option to keep striving for brighter joy. Cost visible on-page: joint ache, rough lion, admission that rust-hued peace is not former joy. Agency is attention/continuation rather than external victory—valid under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: containment of the uncontainable (lions/grief) through craft. Subtext operates in silence—tea steam, wood grain, rain—never translated into moral. Final image re-prices earlier lions: they are not memorials but proof that “nothing truly disappears, it only changes form,” a conceptual cost heavier than sentiment. Avoids “here and gone” echo as thesis; lets pattern of repetitions with variation do the work.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature: Marguerite notices grain tightness, kettle over-tones, joint protest—never abstract inventory. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long reflective sentences in chair, clipped “Enough time. Always just enough time.” Free indirect clean, no filter-stack. Diction stays within carpentry/performance lexicon; no register drift. Every repetition (lion, here/gone, enough) is patterned, taught, paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: single sentence often layers sensory data, backstory shard, and micro-choice (“ash wood warmed in her palms, its grain tight and patient”). No paraphrase loops; each return of “here and gone” adds micro-shift of meaning. Metaphors lean but never mixed: e.g., “crystallized” time stays geological, never clashes with kettle steam. Only minor scaffold: “the way all things eventually become” could compress, but does not impede closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Fresh angle: grief-counseling via wood-carving inherited from circus craft; lion tamer’s fear-containment transposed to widow’s emotional carpentry. Specificity (sawdust in brick loft, adrenaline-buzz tea) prevents trope trap. Risk of lyric repetition paid off when final cup-steam recharges “here and gone” motif. Could edge higher if student interaction had been dramatized to test premise, but within 800 words the contained studio hour feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
