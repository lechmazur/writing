<comment>Marina’s interiority stays concrete—she names languages, reefs, shrapnel—and her fear of “telling stories that hurt people because I got the words twisted” crystallizes a translator’s occupational dread. The micro-choice to soften “the boats are coming” into “the boats brought help” is a visible, merciful edit that costs her professional exactness. The girl’s shrewd innocence is shown through her unsolicited confession and spontaneous trust; both characters display contradictory impulses simultaneously rather than alternating summaries. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: she accepts the price of imperfect memory-keeping and walks toward surgery lighter, the coral now discardable.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the coral fragment becomes discardable, the shrapnel is about to be removed, and “healing was just another form of translation” reweights the whole premise with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the smudged cast builds pattern, density increases as each word is reclaimed, and the final image crystallizes when Marina decides to let the tides take the coral. No orientation debt; who/where/when land within 70 words. Persistent constraint—linguistic guilt—shapes every micro-choice and the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium is not postcard décor: condensation on ceiling panels catches dying light, turning it amber and cueing the twilight timeframe; the plastic chair’s tactile chill undergirds the anesthetic warmth. Micro-setting functions as tool: the plaster cast’s smeared surface becomes the workspace where language is reclaimed, constraining possible readings and forcing Marina’s softening translation. Spatial choreography is clean—girl crosses, climbs, mother returns without drift. Setting detail is filtered through translator’s trained eye: she notices languages “tanching together like fishing nets,” not tourist exotica.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fear of remembering/relaying wrong—tightens when each smudged letter recovered threatens to re-injure the girl’s memory or the boy’s mother Marina once mistranslated. The single deepening beat is the decision to soften the Tausug warning; this narrows Marina’s ethical options and pays visible cost by sacrificing literal accuracy for mercy. Agency is continuous: every decoded phrase is an active translation choice under drug-dulled time pressure. Cost is legible: the coral must be discarded because the translator’s credo has been irreversibly edited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as both wound and suture—language can shard or graft. Subtext lives in the cast: the girl’s own body becomes palimpsest, and Marina’s tactile re-inscription shows that meaning is always provisional. Final image of “healing was just another form of translation” reweights the premise non-literally, reframing surgery as editorial act. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the softened boats warning, leaving reader to feel mercy’s cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person-deep POV stays stable; no head-hopping. Voice texture is translator-specific: “languages tanched together like fishing nets,” “brain coral fragment … salvaged from a reef destroyed during a naval skirmish”—diction precise, maritime, professional. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences under anesthetic give way to staccato questions between the pair, mirroring slowed then sharpened attention. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “You understand it” carries accusation and relief in four words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“warm honey” anesthetic, “brain coral fragment,” “shrapnel they would remove” each perform double duty (sensation + symbol). Metaphors are coherent: coral = structural memory; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; sentences open varied. One minor overwriting puff: “lotus-hearted ache” edges purple but is earned by prior lotus-less mist imagery and pays off in final line cadence. Grammar clean; pronoun track immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—translator decrypting a child’s injury-prop instead of wartime radio—flips expected spy tropes into intimate ethics. Coral fragment as mnemonic prosthesis is fresh; its discard signals translator’s acceptance of imperfect versions. Risk taken: lyrical closure without surgical gore; coherence maintained. Specificity resists generic war-story backdrop: Mindanao/Sulu Sea naming, Tausug phonetic spelling, “tanching” neologism all feel lived, not Googled.</comment>
