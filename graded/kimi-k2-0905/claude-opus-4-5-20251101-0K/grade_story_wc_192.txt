<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guarding her emptiness yet polishing the ring weekly—are dramatized in body and ritual, not told. The final choice to open the door is prepared by that ritual and by the shared scar logic, so the cost of letting the threshold dissolve feels earned. Sera remains slightly less individuated, her dialogue edging toward therapeutic shorthand (“I’m suffocating”), which blunts the relational crucible. Still, Mira’s micro-choices visibly foreclose her three-year solitude and the interior contradiction holds to the last line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the threshold reforms as a thinner membrane, re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain is tight—scar-link summons Sera, ritual ring-tending makes the admission possible, the doorway image repays the bridge-burning rule. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“the ashen charcoal sanctuary…”) and the lens (Hybrid→Causal at end) is legible throughout. Only the thinnest waver: Sera’s sudden arrival is accepted without on-page resistance that might have sharpened the cost further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s charcoal dust and starlight gaps are lived-in—Mira navigates them by touch, bandage, and ritual polishing. The doorknocker ring is used twice (polishing, then lifted to admit) and its iron coldness constrains the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds: distances, door, floor, roof gaps track cleanly. Weather/starlight subtly mirrors internal shift without symbolic overkill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can Mira keep her emptiness intact?”—tightens the moment she lifts the ring. One meaningful deepening: the threshold dissolves, foreclosing permanent isolation. Cost is visible: her sanctuary must now accommodate passage in both directions. Under Causal lens, the escalation is clean; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of bridge-burning into doorway-making, never sermonized. The final image—“doorways…allowed passage in both directions”—reprices the rule-set without moral tag. Subtext resides in silence and gesture (ring lift, dust disturbance). Loaded emptiness as concept is risked but avoids abstraction by being enacted through ritual and spatial invasion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: ash, starlight, ritual cadence, anatomical precision (“constellations across her arms”). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hop. Compression (“timber by timber”) and lyric elongation (“permeable as grief”) modulate with emotional tempo. Dialogue carries subtext: “Your scars called to mine” implies both accusation and plea. Register stays within Mira’s wounded-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High information density: “threshold was fading…” does world-rule, interior symptom, and time marker in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are kept coherent (smoke, membrane, grief). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Closing line (“doorways…both directions”) lands with rhythmic snap and semantic payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar trope—hermit confronted by past—is refreshed by the inverse bridge/doorway metaphysics and scar-map tracking system. Risk of abstract concept is taken and paid off through concrete ritual objects. Specificity of “charcoal sanctuary built from burned letters” anchors the fantasy in tactile detail. The tender-shadow-keeper lore feels invented yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
