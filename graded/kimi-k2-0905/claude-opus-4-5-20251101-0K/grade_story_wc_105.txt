<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic color-hearing drives every micro-choice—and the embodied grief of “pressure from fathoms of water” lands. The moment she calibrates the device to her own fourteen-year-old voice is a credible, earned renunciation. Yet the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only implicit; the loneliness is told more than tested under live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the wire-snap sound of her own young trust become the aurora-tuned frequency she mails upward—cost is the audible self-betrayal she now immortalizes. Causal lattice holds: every beat is “because the greenhouse / forge / aurora permits,” culminating in the imprint that reweights her mission from understanding to gift-making. One minor orientation debt: the phrase “cells divide” is the only time cue for the “while” frame—readers may not feel the living clock until late.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse’s cracked ribs and geothermal forge are not backdrop—they are the only place this imprint can occur; the final image of green light through fractured glass literalizes her own cracked trust. Kelp-threaded iron constrains her every motion; the ashen forge’s heat dictates tempo. Micro-setting (the glass fragment) is handled twice and returns in the closure, recharging meaning. All sensory picks are POV-filtered: “singing green” is synesthetic, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the exact frequency of trust breaking—tightens when she realizes the hollow is her own adolescent voice; that micro-turn narrows options from scientific distance to self-exposure. Cost is visceral: “wept into her helmet” after hearing the thin wire snap. No antagonist is needed; the greenhouse pressure and aurora window supply coherent external urgency. Escalation is accumulative: each absence-collecting beat adds density until the pattern breaks inward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—absence as an audible artifact—emerges through concrete procedure rather than thesis: every receiver is soldered from shipwrecked metal, literalizing how wreckage can be re-tuned. The final image reweights “green” from aurora beauty to the color of self-betrayal without moralizing. Subtext in the mother’s vanishing is left hauntingly open, inviting counter-readings. No symbolic convenience; the synesthetic gift is used, not displayed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Marina’s synesthetic sensorium; diction (“salt and silence,” “singing green”) is compressed yet precise. Rhythm modulates: long lapping sentences for kelp sway, then the staccato “thin and high, like a wire snapping” at climax. No head-hop; the mother’s interior is only hypothesized, preserving POV modesty. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is alive—no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically loyal: “cathedral of moss” is accurate to ribbed glass; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can weld place, tool, and emotional state (“The forge still functioned, heated now by geothermal vents rather than coal, and above it the aurora’s light filtered…”). Minor scaffold: “pressure from fathoms of water” is a near cliché, but it occurs early and is quickly particularized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Concept—“hearing aids for the dead”—is fresh yet immediately credible via metallurgical detail and synesthetic calibration. Synesthesia is not quirk but method: color-hearing lets her isolate the amber of disappointment. Risky underwater greenhouse never feels gimmick because physics (cold, pressure, geothermal) stay consistent. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course a sunken forge under aurora would be the place to anneal a memory of betrayal.</comment>
