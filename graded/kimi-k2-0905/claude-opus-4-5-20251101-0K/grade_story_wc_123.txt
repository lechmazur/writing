<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “meticulous devotion” shown through seventeen years of storm logs—but the epiphany (“impossibility shifted beneath her”) is articulated rather than dramatized with bodily cost. The renunciation of immediate action is credible, yet the emotional contradiction between fear and scientific hunger could be sharper in-scene. Still, her flaws (naïve persistence, solitary risk) complicate the final stillness and foreclose the safe path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to “carry the message forward” reweights her earlier solitude into purposeful subversion, with the visible cost of endangering her quiet life. Causal linkage holds: message → pattern recognition → revised tactic; the brass tube recurs as constraint. One minor scaffold: “She would need to hide her journals…” forecasts instead of dramatizing, but the final image of “steady patience of storms” crystallizes options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted mill gap, dry fountain, and lavender dusk are filtered through Mira’s weather-eye; the courtyard’s stopped water echoes her suspended safety. Spatial track is clean: bench → pocket → coat → home path. The brass tube constrains the next move and is re-handled twice, nearly qualifying for 9+ gate; however, it does not physically limit her escape route, so stays sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity versus state secrecy—tightens once: the message turns passive observation into active danger. Escalation is a single deepening rather than because/therefore chain, fitting Accumulative design. The price (future persecution) is conceptual, legible in the “steady patience” image. No reversible turn, but one meaningful shift satisfies short-form rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the motif of recording: integrity as quiet, continuous witness. The final image reprises “storms gather quietly,” reweighting solitude from refuge to weapon. No overt thesis, but the understated parallel between natural and manufactured storms invites reflection on truth’s latency. Mild abstraction in “world had forgotten what truth looked like” is earned by prior concrete logs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira’s perceptual filter—wind velocity, compass pocket—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under shock (“Read it twice…”). No dialogue, so voice carries via tactile diction: “paper curled tight as a sleeping moth.” Register stays within self-taught meteorologist lexicon; no filter-verb clog. Rhythm modulates effectively, meriting high-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong info density: single sentences twin action & atmosphere (“settled onto the stone bench, her…journal pressed against her chest”). Few scaffolding repeats; only “she would need to…” forecasts. Metaphors are controlled; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loop: “the world had forgotten… she always remembered” echoes prior clause, but it tightens theme. Closure line is clean, cadence resolved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weather-manufacturing quarantine zone freshes the dystopia trope by linking meteorology to dissent; Mira’s lateral curiosity is less common than rebel hacker. Yet the “followed home” beat and brass tube are familiar spy motifs, not wholly transformed. Specific storm logs and the image of storms as quiet conspirators add local originality. Sufficient risk for +0.2 within band.</comment>
