<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-struck vigilance and the micro-choice to weave the compass-tones into her wedding song are vividly embodied; the contradictory impulses (keep waiting vs. act) coexist in-scene. The final hand-on-keys moment crystallizes a credible renunciation of solitude with visible cost. Interiority steers clear of therapy-speak; only minor softness: we’re told “strategically creative” rather than shown it shaping earlier beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens: projector → hidden frames → tonal beacon → airship arrival forms a clean because/therefore chain. The closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (broken clock face cracks, time restarts). Orientation anchored by 50 words; no causality breaks. Minor but non-capping slip: compass coordinates decoded off-stage—causality intact because she still must choose to play the exact modified song live.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tidal arbor’s swaying deck and cloud-curtains constrain piano volume and landing clearance; body-as-setting (hands on keys, cracked clock-glass) charges the final image. Sensory picklist favors sound/mist over visual cliché. Selective detail supports theme without tourist fog. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reunion or perpetual limbo—tightens when hidden frames prove he is alive and she must convert memory into navigational signal. One meaningful escalation: decision to amplify wedding song with code-tones under dusk-window pressure. The needle-spin compasses manifest off-stage; nevertheless her playing is direct agency that forecloses continued waiting. Cost legible: piano silence after landing = vocation surrendered for relationship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges non-literally: art as homing signal; love as technology of attention. Broken clock, compasses, and “unplanned encore” reweight (Conceptual Repricing) without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—hand atop hers—avoids sentimentality. No thesis statement; resonance lingers through specific image of shattered clock-glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third lyrical close, stable throughout; perceptual signature filters observation through musical ear (notes “dissolve into mist,” tonal patterns). Syntax flexes with emotional swell; no filter-verb tics. Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textual: “You surprised fate.” Compression and patterned diction taught early (“clouds broke against invisible shores”) and paid off in final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence advances image, sound, or causality; no scaffold. Rhythm varies—long breath for arbor panorama, clipped for craft touchdown. Figurative mixes (clouds as “shores,” compasses as “flickering”) stay coherent within sky-navigation metaphor. Proofing clean; only micro-loop is “cloud-filtered twilight” echoing earlier cloud refs but it is purposeful callback, not churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating transit station as romantic way-station feels fresh; reunion via encoded film + piano-beacon is non-obvious synthesis. Premise commits fully to sky-ocean logic without late rule patch. Specific detail (receiver inside clock) prevents generic swap. Risky lyric density paid off in earned closure. No close echoes of iconic scenes.</comment>
