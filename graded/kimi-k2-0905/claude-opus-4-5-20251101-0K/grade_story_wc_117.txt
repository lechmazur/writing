<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete and embodied—touching the locket, adjusting her expression to give Maya room—yet her “softly adaptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The mother-daughter crucible is vivid, but the emotional stakes plateau; no contradictory impulse complicates Elena’s calm. The locket hand-off is a believable micro-choice, yet it merely extends her existing serenity rather than testing it. Closure lands as gentle stasis, not costly renunciation, so the arc feels circular rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket passage crystallizes “lifelong wonder” as chosen stance, with conceptual cost—Elena relinquishes the relic of infant-Maya to future-Maya. Accumulative lens holds: eclipse, sage scent, and root-network imagery tighten the mother-to-daughter hand-off. One soft spot: the eclipse mechanics are external backdrop rather than causal pivot; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final image reweights prior material with undeniable emotional cost under a coherent lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sage Ridge is anchored early, sensory layers (dusty perfume, bird false-evening song) filter through Elena’s therapist gaze, and the locket micro-setting constrains the decisive hand-off. Spatial choreography is clean—summit blanket, root myth, eclipse corona—each detail re-enters to charge the ending. One missed chance: the “underground rivers older than memory” never pressurize choice; they stay decorative. Yet environment suffuses the final image enough to meet the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stake—maternal fear of dissolution vs. daughter’s launch—signals early and tightens through eclipse countdown. No visible resource lost or option foreclosed; the hand-off is symbolic, not tactical. Pressure is atmospheric (ephemeral light, sage scent) rather than causal, fitting Accumulative lens, but cost stays conceptual rather than felt on the page. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, yet lacks a palpable price that alters next moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—“ordinary magic” as chosen attention—emerges through Elena’s professional examples and the locket’s reprise, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: Elena’s adjusted smile, Maya’s tear-smile under totality. Final paragraph’s “ordinary extraordinary moment” is borderline thematic echo but earns partial pass via prior image bank. Ambiguity lingers: wonder is maintenance, not possession; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elena with therapist’s perceptual signature—selective attention to breath, root dreams, patient archetypes—never leaking into Maya’s head. Rhythm modulates: lyrical long sentences under eclipse hush, shorter exchanges during daughter’s admission. Dialogue carries subtext (“you’re doing that thing again”) and distinguishes generational idiom. No head-hop or register drift; voice coherence intact under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: sensory nouns (dusty perfume, corona flare) do double duty advancing mood and metaphor. One paraphrase loop—“ordinary magic” named twice in closing grafs—slips into template cadence but does not touch final image. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; punctuation clean. Read-aloud rhythm crests with eclipse darkness, then exhales as light returns, matching emotional cadence.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mother-daughter eclipse hand-off is familiar terrain, yet the therapist’s vocational lens and root-network metaphor freshen the frame. Risk is lyric_accumulation rather than plot twist; eclipse serves as secular communion, not spectacle. Specificity of baby curl inside glass locket provides irreplaceable prop. Transformation test: swap therapist for generic mom and the arc collapses, so premise feels lived-in rather than templated.</comment>
