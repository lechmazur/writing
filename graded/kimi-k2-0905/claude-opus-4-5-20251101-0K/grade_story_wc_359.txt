<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Meren’s synesthetic gift is shown, not labeled, and it drives every action she takes; the 17-year search is compressed but still grounds her monomania. Her moment of realization—that silence was unfinished, not sacred—arrives as embodied awe (frozen tears) and forces a costly choice to break the very hush she revered. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the interior contradiction (destroy what she loves to save wonder) is dramatized in-scene. The only flaw is a touch of explanatory prose about “certifying wonder” that drifts toward thesis rather than lived stake.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s first toll reweights silence from masterpiece to partnership, and the cost is the amber sheet’s dissolution plus perpetual exile from the pure hush she once worshipped. Causal chain holds: synesthetic gift → read aurora → strike bell → unfetter world, each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean by 120 words (who, where, stakes). One micro-transition (descent) is allowed in a two-shard lyric design; pattern is taught early (“she climbed”) and closure returns to stair descent, completing loop. No teleporting props or knowledge leaks.</comment>

<comment>Ice cavern is not backdrop but acoustic instrument: prismed light, frozen congregants, and sculpted hush directly constrain Meren’s choice to break or preserve silence. Synesthetic overlay turns setting into playable interface—each color becomes a musical key—so environment shapes tactics in real time. Micro-setting qualifies: the bell itself functions as place + tool + stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Minor over-purple phrase “impossible gold” is the single hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—faces concrete test: will she preserve perfect silence or shatter it to release trapped music? Escalation is single but decisive: the aurora’s colors tighten from spectacle to playable score, forcing the irreversible strike. Cost is visible: amber sheet turns to dust, her tears freeze, and the bell’s perpetual song exiles her from the purity she loved. Agency is entirely hers; no coincidence rescues or blocks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: wonder is not certified by decree but by the willingness to destroy one’s own idol. Subtext lives in the bell’s glow—its beauty intensifies exactly as it becomes vulnerable to fracture. Final image of “living silence” that now contains all songs is a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo lines; the closest (“Wonder...needed only someone willing to ring the bell”) is earned by 800 words of dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Meren’s synesthetic perception; every sentence is filtered through color-sound translation. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—no academic intrusion. Rhythmic control heightens with pressure: short percussive clauses mimic the bell’s strike, then lengthen into echoing cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A; internal voice is coherent and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new sensory or causal information. Metaphors are internally coherent (frozen congregants, acoustic marble) and never mixed. High information density: one line can anchor space, body, and stake (“She was a prism-song bell ringer...”). Final third is artifact-free; closure image is crystal-clear. Only micro-tick: occasional adjective triplets (“green and violet and impossible gold”) but they read as synesthetic overflow, not purple excess.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of synesthesia + auroral music sheet + unringable bell is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—making silence itself the antagonist—pays off by transforming stagnation into living breath. No familiar pop-culture echoes; the First Song myth is built from scratch. Final reconfiguration (silence as container for all future songs) is a fresh inflection that could not survive swapping names or places.</comment>
