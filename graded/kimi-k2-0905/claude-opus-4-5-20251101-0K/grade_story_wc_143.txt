<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-motivated quest plus the hourglass talisman give her interiority traction; the “purposefully curious” trait is asserted, never shown complicating a live decision under pressure. The final stance is a credible renunciation, but we get only one micro-choice—setting the camera—so the cost feels light for 780 words. Still, her voicing of loss stays consistent and specific enough to feel individual rather than archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers another vanishing (darkness, father, film) until the satellite’s running lights break the pattern. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photo preserves what is already gone, reweighting progress with palpable cultural cost. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The single beat of escalation suffices under this lens, cost visible in “It was enough.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Volcanic scree, aperture light, satellite glare—details are filtered through Elena’s professional eye and selectively deployed. The summit constrains movement and supplies the reflective lake that literalizes “held breath,” feeding the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dumps. Lacks one tighter object-interaction beat that would push it into 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loss of natural darkness—signals early and tightens through timed chemical packets and the literal countdown to sunrise. Stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt until the final satellite pass; cost is intellectual more than tactical, keeping pressure cerebral. Agency resides in endurance/witness, qualifying as renunciation under Accumulative lens; one visible forfeiture (the photo can never be replicated) suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of irreversible cultural vanishing emerges through the father–daughter lineage of obsolete nocturnal guardianship; no overt thesis statements. The hourglass grain reprises as private hourglass for the planet’s final night, reweighting its meaning without authorial nudge. Subtext in gesture—touching the vial—carries filial continuity more cleanly than exposition could. Final image resists moralizing while still inviting reader lament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Elena’s calibrated scientific perception; diction (“orbital shipyards…blazed like fallen constellations”) stays within her professional lexicon. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, compresses during timed packet releases, mirroring emotional modulation. No dialogue to test, but interior voice avoids filter-verb staleness and sustains a mournful rhythmic cadence that peaks in “It was enough.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, with strong nouns and verbs; occasional elevated phrasing (“extinction list she had been compiling since childhood”) nudges register but remains in character. One scaffold loop: “she had…before the…” repeats structure twice in close proximity. No mixed metaphors; imagery stays coherent. Final sentence lands with punch; rhythm supports momentum rather than stalls it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing astro-photochemistry elegy with Cold-War crater origin feels fresh; the hourglass grain as private time-keeper is an efficient, specific twist on heirloom. Conceptual risk—mourning darkness itself—could slide into abstraction but is grounded in sensorial detail. While “last darkness photo” idea is not unprecedented, the father-daughter observatory lineage particularizes it enough to avoid template staleness.</comment>
