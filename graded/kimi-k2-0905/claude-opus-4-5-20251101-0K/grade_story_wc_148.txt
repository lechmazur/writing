<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo’s need to redeem his father’s name by becoming the first “wolf-cryer” who is believed is clear and personal, but the interiority stays slightly abstract (“stood trembling,” “he thought”) rather than giving us a visceral contradiction inside the confessional. The single moment of embodied cost—gripping the lattice until it cracks—does land, but it comes late; earlier beats summarize emotion rather than dramatize it. The final renunciation (walking toward patrol with proof) is credible, yet the micro-choices that earn it are more declared than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (inherited shame, scuffed door, copperlight repetition) and lets the lattice/screen become the tangible closure object; the final shatter of the hush-thing is the Decisive Change that reweights “belief” from abstract hope to material proof. Causality is coherent: letters → lighthouse → lattice → naming → creature destabilized. The only minor slack is the off-stage warden atrocity—usable as ticking clock, but feels outline-adjacent rather than on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Salt-crusted windows, diamond lattice slits, and the “woman-shaped void where light bent wrong” give selective, POV-filtered sensory hits that guide Milo’s tactical moves (peering, gripping, speaking through the screen). Lighthouse-to-confessional conversion is sketched in two brisk sentences—enough for this length—and the copperlight recurrence keys the tonal through-line. Spatial tracking holds: from exterior reef, up to lighthouse, into narrow door, inside confessional, to doorway behind him—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“be believed before dawn patrol arrives”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the hush-thing physically appears; Milo’s agency shifts from sneaking-in to naming/acknowledging, which directly collapses the creature. The price (voice evaporating, lattice cracking) is brief but legible; the patrol horn externalizes a social cost awaiting him. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal, yet the silence-thickening counts as meaningful deepening under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme—truth demands a witness who chooses listening—emerges through the lattice as conduit of testimony rather than authorial statement. Subtext lives in the torn screen, the scratched dates, the copper glow that turns from shame-color to absolution-color. Final image (Milo walking toward horn with cracked lattice) gives a non-literal answer: credibility is forged by risking voice, not by eliminating doubt. No moralizing paragraph, only the implicit reconfiguration of “cry wolf” from lie to legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Milo with no head-hop; perceptual signature is strong—“honey-slow,” “birthstone no one wanted to wear,” “silence like skin.” Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses for density, then staccato “He turned.” when void appears. No dialogue to judge; interior voice avoids filter-verb stacks. Register remains in a seventeen-year-old’s plausible range while still achieving lyric lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally taut; sentences multitask (“The copperlight of dusk filtered through salt-crusted windows, casting everything in amber stillness” sets time, place, mood, visual filter in one blow). A few near-duplicates—“something hunting… something that wore silence”—slip into template cadence but not at climax. Mixed-metaphor watch: “hush given form” and “void where light bent wrong” stay internally consistent. No loops, no scaffolding, no artifact drag on the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inverting the wolf fable into a meta-fable about the necessity of being disbelieved feels fresh; the hush-creature as institutional silencing agent is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Lattice screen repurposed from religious divider to truth-amplifier is an organic twist that could not swap out with any other object. Risky second-person fragment (“to thread a labyrinth with your own story”) is brief, taught by context, and pays off in Milo’s final stance. Concept commits fully—no retreat into generic monster story.</comment>
