<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“laughing with the thunder”) and motive endures, but no contradictory impulse ever threatens her stance; the only micro-choice is lighting the wick, a ritual repetition not a fresh risk. Cost is poetic (“aching legs”) rather than dramatized on-page. Character feels singular yet static—sufficient for lyric mode but short of 7+ without a tested flaw or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each descriptive layer thickens the beacon’s charge until the final emerald sweep reconfigures the sky’s relation to land. Closure is a Charged Poise—the beam’s silent covenant with storms—felt cost is the solitude she’ll re-enter at dawn. Orientation anchored by line 5; no causality break. One reflective block (~22 %) stays tethered to present action. Meets 9- gate but minor looseness in middle paragraph keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerald lens, lightning-filled wick, and spiral stairs are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly enable the climactic light-bend. Stars “pressed close like curious children” mirrors her isolation while guiding the beam’s outward arc. Micro-setting (the lamp room axis) literally constrains the alignment choice. One loose weather cliché (“painting the walls in shades of gold”) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the covenant alive—signaled early; pressure tightens only descriptively (storms “waiting”) rather than through a new obstacle or trade-off. No option is foreclosed; the routine succeeds exactly as intended. Accumulative lens allows lyric deepening, yet the lack of a visible price or narrowing keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal stewardship emerges through light-shadow duality rather than statement. Final image of “new dawn shaped by ancient shadows” reweights the premise with conceptual cost: progress depends on obsolete memory. Ambiguity lingers—who will remember after her? No moralizing. One near-echo of thematic tagline in penultimate paragraph caps the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her perceptual quirks (sound as color, light as grammar). Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens during strike: rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience (“world had moved on…”) but pulls back immediately. Distinctive without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (image + world rule). Two adjacent “as she always did” loops create minor scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal and motive-driven. One overwrought cluster (“symphony of thunder and joy”) slightly bruises climax. Otherwise clean, propulsive, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Forgotten covenant between sky-keeper and sentient weather feels fresh yet mythic. Total-internal-reflection steering merges physics with animism in a way not seen in cli-fi templates. Risk is lyric stasis, but accrued detail prevents gimmick. Could swap lighthouse for tower without breaking arc, so not quite 9.0.</comment>
