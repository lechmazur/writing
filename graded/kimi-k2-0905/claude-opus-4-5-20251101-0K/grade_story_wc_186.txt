<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation to decipher the prism and relight the beacon is legible, but her interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“thistle-blown hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive act of relighting is earned, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized—no moment of visible renunciation or failure scars her. Vera’s posthumous presence supplies pressure, but because she is off-page, the relationship crucible is absent and secondary pressure collapses to memory. Still, micro-choices (touching the prism, neglecting the flame, running to the tower) track coherently and carry the arc.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: prism vision → date recognition → beacon relight → visible signal. Orientation is clean by line 4; the single transition from pavilion to tower is sign-posted. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam ignites exactly as stars align, reweighting prior coincidences into cosmic grammar with felt conceptual cost—survivors will migrate toward her light, foreclosing her solitude. The lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.</comment>

<comment>Glass pavilion, prism, and beacon tower are selectively detailed, each returning to constrain action: pavilion amplifies memory, prism must be placed on its pedestal, tower must be rekindled. Star-alignment mechanics are sketched via Vera’s equation and verified tonight, giving world rules credibility. Spatial choreography is crisp: spiral stairs, central pedestal, distance to valley. Weather is limited to starlit sky, but that economy suits the urgent night-time drive. Final image of aligned constellations recharges the setting rather than decorating it.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences have meaning and decide whether to relight—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when neglecting the beacon risks total darkness, narrowing her practical option to one. Cost is visible: she forfeits isolation and accepts an un-tracked influx of survivors. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the core problem, only her final strike of the flint. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “coincidence as grammar” rather than exposition; the final beacon-beam literalizes the sentence. Subtext operates in silence: the shard of hush is first a curiosity, finally the pregnant pause before collective motion. No moral is stated; the closing image reweights prior devastation into potential genesis. Emotional after-effect is concrete—readers feel the valleys stirring toward light—avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Perceptual signature favors synesthetic physicality (“frequency in her teeth”). Prism, star charts, and moth-eaten velvet are noticed through her custodian bias. Prose is lyric yet syntactically varied; no template cadence. One line of疑似 thesis-speak (“coincidences were the universe’s grammar”) is forgivable because it is internalized as her culminating synthesis and immediately embodied by the beacon blaze.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and multi-tasking: “She set the broken prism on the pavilion’s central pedestal, where the humming reached its purest tone” advances action, object geography, and sensory texture simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“color of infected wounds” mirrors emotional fallout. Tense and pronoun reference stable. Only minor elevation into poetic register (“shard of hush”) but pattern is taught early and pays off, so no register drift penalty.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-tender is familiar, but coupling retrocognitive archaeology with star-cycle rebirth grammar is fresh. Broken crystal as memory amplifier and celestial alignments as predictive text feel inevitable yet non-obvious. The risk of lyric compression is embraced and succeeds: 700 words carry epic scope without exposition bloat. Specificity—moth-eaten velvet wrapper, Observatory District skeleton—grounds novelty in tactile detail. Transformation test passes: swap prism for Geiger counter and the emotional-astral logic collapses.</comment>
