<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The guardian’s muteness and vigil read as a single, credible stance; the mirrored micro-choices (angling shutters, beaming the dental mirror at the boy’s heart) externalize her contradictory impulses—rescue without speech—earning her final Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and biased: “darkness is not absence but canvas” is filtered through her dentist-trained eye for angles and light. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; her interior conflict carries the arc. The only minus: we never see her competence falter or genuine mistake compound, so struggle edges toward stoic perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy walks away alive, guardian’s silence charged with new meaning—darkness taught to hold stars—felt cost is the ongoing vigil she must keep. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because she keeps weaving patterns, therefore the canal’s menace is re-weighted for the boy and for us. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“junction where old waterway met newer concrete”); no debt. No causality break; every beat grows from prior light-weave. Cost is legible in “she remained at her post…spiralingly calm,” foreclosing any prospect of her own release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dock, rain puddles, warped planks, and shutter slats act as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move (where she stands, how she angles light). Stillwater tension is rendered through precise sensory hierarchy: visual gleam of dental mirror, haptic creak of shutters, acoustic hush after rain. Weather evolves with beat—overcast fragments become scattered star-diamonds—mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: guardian at junction, boy at far end, beam travels uninterrupted to his chest. Dock after rain is indispensable to final charged image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the boy succumb to the canal’s darkness? Escalation is textural—each shutter pattern increases density of attention until a single beam lands on his heart, narrowing option from water to starlight. Her agency is the weave; cost is the eternal vigil she recommits to at the end. No external coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length and is delivered when the mirror dot touches him—final proof darkness can hold stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as canvas for empathy, darkness as prerequisite for light. No explicit thesis; final image of real stars replacing artificial ones reweights prior patterns without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—angled slats, mirrored light—never spelled out. Complexity acknowledged: guardian’s own salvation remains incomplete; boy’s future uncertain. Resonance lingers in “spiralingly calm,” a quiet conceptual repricing that revalues stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person intimate sustains a hushed, tidal rhythm; syntax lengthens then contracts like canal breath. Dental-mirror perceptual signature recurs—“angles where darkness gathered thickest”—without drifting into clinical detachment. Metaphors stay within her vocational lexicon: nautilus of light, scattered diamonds. Filter verbs almost absent; immediacy intact. No dialogue, so voice evaluation defaults to narrative texture, which is singular and consistent.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence layers image + motive + micro-setting. Opening “cobalt dock stretched into the canal like a bruise healing” fuses color, tactility, and process in one stroke. Density high—“water pooled between the warped planks, each puddle holding fragments of the overcast sky” does three jobs. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses build stillwater tension, then short “She did not call out” snaps like a shutter. Final line “spiralingly calm” crystallizes cadence and theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: mute grief encoded via light-weaving language of dental mirrors and boathouse shutters—occupational specificity transforms vigil trope. Stillwater tension + star-in-darkness motif particularized through dock optics rather than cliché. Risk is quiet ending, but earned stasis lands with cost. Not quite 9 because premise (saving stranger from suicide) is familiar at core, though execution is distinctive.</comment>
