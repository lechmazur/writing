<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Meren’s contradictory impulses—fleeing knowledge yet chasing it under world-collapse—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices: arranging rocks, gripping slick stone, deciding to pour star dust. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“weathered hands,” “slick stone,” “seal-skin pouch”) rather than diagnostic. The final harnessing is earned: seventeen years of scraping meteorites plus grandmother’s promise create visible cost. Only flaw: relationship/status crucible unused (no second on-page character), capping at 8.7.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: friction disappearance → eel thriving → Meren forced to act; star-dust anchor allows vision without causality break; final reverse-sequence is the Decisive Change that restores friction wrong-way, cost felt in “she could look without causing.” Closure image (“aurora sang…eels began to dance”) crystallizes reconfigured world. Orientation clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—curse observation price—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Tidal bluff, painted rocks, seal-skin pouch, and aurora-lit sea constrain every move: slick footing demands deliberate grip, rock geometry dictates vision access. Sensory hierarchy (violet shadows, bioluminescent algae pigments) filters through eel-herder expertise. Final image—aurora singing while eels dance—charges closure by merging setting and action. Micro-setting objects (rocks, pouch) actively steer plot, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—restore friction before world unravels—tightens when vision reveals reversed friction horror. Star-dust use is the visible price that narrows option: one shot to rewrite physics. Escalation is causal: each rock placed increases visionary pressure until harness action is the only path left. Cost legible in seventeen-year sacrifice and curse risk; no off-stage shortcuts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: knowledge as double-edged (vision cements futures) vs. responsibility to act. Sacred patterns motif reweights at closure—patterns once feared become salvation. No moralizing; resonance lives in final image of eels dancing geometry. Grandmother’s promise and star dust serve as concrete particulars, not abstract symbols.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains eel-herder perceptual signature: nautilus proportions, meteorite grit, algae glow. Syntax grows clipped under visionary pressure (“The vision struck immediately, as it always did”). No dialogue, so voice purity judged via lyrical, tide-breath cadence that accelerates at climax. Elision taught early—“she had learned to look away”—and paid off when she chooses to look.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long silk-like sentence opens, then staccato “She positioned the seventeenth stone.” Information density high: one sentence anchors rock sequence, nautilus math, and bioluminescent source. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors (“silk torn from dying stars”) remain consistent with light/texture logic. Closure line—“aurora sang…eels began to dance”—is sonically resolved without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“friction disappears” eel-herder must restore physics via sacred geometry—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Star dust as collapsed light anchor, eels as living vector, and precognitive curse price synthesize into non-obvious solution. Risk of lyric speculative mode pays off: world rules taught through action, not exposition. Specificity of pigment source, rock count, and auroral color shift prevents generic feel.</comment>
