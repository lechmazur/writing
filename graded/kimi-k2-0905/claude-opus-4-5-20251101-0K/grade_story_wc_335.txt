<comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses (retreating physically while advancing morally) play live in scene; the annotation act crystallizes her “combative tenderness” with visible cost. The tea-leaf reading is embodied, not told, and her decision to mentor Kael issues from prior exile guilt Thessaly surfaces. Interiority is concrete (“shard-mirror sigil into red wax”) and emotions are body-led (“throat tighten”). The only drag: Kael remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible tests Mira alone.

<comment>Drive lens = causal: “because she was once exiled, therefore she reverses Kael’s.” Orientation (who/where/when) lands by word 60; no penalty. Closure = Earned Stasis: annotating forecloses the safe path of bureaucratic neutrality, cost felt in the wax seal and the backward-walk echo she must now watch Kael repeat. Causality clean; no teleporting props; the swing image bookends exile duration without cheating time.

<comment>Micro-setting dominance: the glass paperweight’s trapped shadow constrains Mira’s gaze and later charges the ending when “afternoon shadow… stretched toward change.” Forgotten library supplies dust, marble clicks, and social context of archivist judgment. Sensory hierarchy obeys archivist priorities: light angles, shard glint, tea-leaf geometry. Spatial choreography holds as Mira walks backwards between shelves while Thessaly enters from between stacks.

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will she risk mentoring the boy who shattered what she protects? Tightening arrives with Thessaly’s cue to “analyze,” forcing the tea-leaf micro-choice that converts abstract doubt into annotated reversal. Cost is legible: she trades institutional safety for moral responsibility and invites the mirror-dust stares she once feared. Escalation is single but sufficient; no coincidence; agency drives the final seal.

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through shard/light imagery: broken reflections can still guide if someone dares to look. Subtext operates in silence—Thessaly’s teacup placement, Mira’s finger on glass—never sermonizing. Final image of outward-stretching shadow reweights premise: destruction becomes possibility. No moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers in “waiting swing.”

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist notices refraction, angles, dust motes; verbs like “catalogued,” “trapping,” “sigil.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for backward walk, staccato note-taking at climax. Free indirect clean: “Triangles mean conflict unresolved” stays inside Mira’s lexicon. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“You reversed your own exile once” lands like a mirror shard).

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer tactile detail, backstory flash, and emotional charge (“afternoon light slanted…trapping a shadow like amber preserves a wasp”). Figurative language is sparse and patterned (glass/shadow/reflection motif). No paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and closing lines echo forward/backward motion, creating cadence bookend.

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: reversible exile measured in silences, annotated by tea-leaf geometry—specific to this world. Shard-mirror archive as crucible turns familiar mentor trope into archival forensics. Risk taken with quiet, non-confrontative climax; pays off through charged poise. Could edge higher if Kael’s voice had been sampled to complicate Mira’s projection.
