<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her voice cracks, tears trace “silver paths”—but the moment of change rests on Yua’s lecture rather than a pressured micro-choice of her own. The father remains off-stage, so the emotional engine is second-hand; the final decision to stay is gently foreshadowed but not driven by a visible internal contradiction that costs her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds: each image (spinning hand, trembling foundations, silver leaf) layers density until the final stillness reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“stillness isn’t death, it’s arrival”—with visible cost: Mira accepts her father’s perpetual absence and relinquishes the need to fix the hand. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the final image crystallizes the before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory, moonlit clouds, and pale silver tree are rendered with selective, sense-driven specificity that filters through Mira’s grief. The eastern chamber’s “skeletal remains of instruments” and the leaf’s “whispered-secret” sound are tactile and idiosyncratic, converging to charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; the environment subtly guides choice—catching the leaf stops the hand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—acceptance of loss versus compulsion to fix time—tightens once, when the leaf’s sound halts the hand. Escalation is accretive rather than causal: tremors repeat, hand keeps spinning, until the pattern breaks. The price is the relinquishment of the fantasy of retrieval; it is felt but not dramatized through a protagonist-driven fork. One meaningful deepening suffices under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ephemeral-as-capture theme emerges through concrete particulars: the hand that refuses stillness, the mountain that relearns movement, the leaf whose falling sound is the release. No character moralizes; the final reconfiguration—“only witnessed, honored, and finally released”—is shown via the stopped needle pointing at the moon. The refusal to capture becomes the only way to “harness” the ephemeral, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “luminous ache,” “frozen breath” diction is consistent and character-specific. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences during tremors, clipped fragments at the catch—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on internal cadence; the final “Stay” is spare yet earned. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor is integrated, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: looping “never hurrying, never slowing” mirrors the hand’s motion, justifying the pattern. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or advances image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Minor elevation—“perpetual mist,” “changelessly constant”—stays within lyric register and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of horological metaphysics with high-altitude grief observatory feels fresh; the leaf-as-tuning-fork is a specific, non-obvious invention. Escape velocity recast as emotional release rather than speed avoids cliché. The concept commits fully—no soft reset—and the final reweighting grows inevitably from the pattern. Risk is tempered by recognizable grief arc, but inflection is memorable.</comment>
