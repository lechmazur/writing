<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mei Lin’s interior contradiction—rage buried beneath engineered pacifism—drives every beat; the moment she admits “I am still angry” while stitching her own photograph is a visceral, embodied pivot that forecloses the path of pure equanimity with visible cost. The gravitationally lighter trait is not ornament but kinetic: her rising body literalizes the release of suppressed shadow, making the internal external. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the solitary crucible is sufficient. TheEarned Stasis at the end—she lets the needle rest—carries reconciled darkness, yet the cap stays at 8.7 because the rage-to-forgiveness turn, while credible, is compressed into a single paragraph rather than compounded through earlier micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hundredth tear opens a dimension whose possibility is reweighted by Mei Lin’s integrated shadow, not by machinery. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each crystalline tear adds density until the pattern ruptures—and the final image of the dissolving door crystallizes that cadence shift with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“recycled spaceship drifted”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. No causal break: the tears’ power is established through successive beats, not retroactive rule change.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-ship is not backdrop but micro-setting: its salvaged hull plates and grated corridors constrain Mei Lin’s barefoot glide and house the photographs that supply the plot’s engine. The faint shimmer of dried tears is a tactile, visual tool whose optical behavior is learned early and charges the final pour. Spatial choreography is flawless: workshop → observation deck → dimensional barrier track cleanly. The 9+ gate is met because the vessel itself becomes the final image—starlight from its dissolved seal—recharging earlier metallic motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the sealed dimension—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Mei Lin admits her own tear is the last key, foreclosing escape from self-confrontation. Escalation is textural: each collected tear increases the shimmer-density until the barrier softens; the price is her rising body, literalizing the weight of shadow integrated. No coincidence; the final opening results from her hundredth compassionate act, not luck. Cost is visible: she forfeits her lifelong suppression of anger, a forfeiture shown in the drop that falls “from nowhere.”</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: shadow-work as the price of second chances is enacted, not asserted. The final image—cathedral ship drifting into starlight—reconfigures the premise: redemption is not escape but re-entry into one’s own rejected darkness. Subtext operates in the silence after “I forgive you,” where the absent woman’s forgiveness is actually Mei Lin’s self-pardon. No moralizing; the resonance is in the liquid starfire that re-prices integrated guilt as portal key.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “cathedral of salvaged memories” marries spiritual and mechanical registers in one breath. Perceptual signature is Mei Lin’s gravitational bias—she notices mass, drift, salt weight—consistent throughout. No dialogue, so naturalism test is waived. Free indirect slides cleanly into internal monologue without filter-verb clutter. Prose rhythm mirrors breath: long sentence for stitch meditation, fragment for “I am still angry,” mirroring tension release.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences layer jobs—“She lifted a photograph… shimmering patterns—grief… guilt”—simultaneously reveal object, emotion, and plot clue. Metaphors are coherent: liquid starfire extends tear → light → portal without mixed vehicle. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during tear-collection list, then breathes at final knot. No thesaurus churn; “crystalline,” “salt,” “shimmer” repeat with purpose. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “lightness” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryogenic last man + Buddhist shadow-work + gravitational mood physics feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk—using tear-reading as hard-tech—pays off because mechanics stay consistent (shimmer → compassion → droplet). Transformation test fails if relocated to terrestrial therapy room; the ship’s salvaged memory-cathedral is irreplaceable. No trope harvesting; the locked dimension is not heaven but possibility, avoiding afterlife cliché.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Her pacifism is tested when she must admit rage; the refusal to harm nonetheless confronts darkness, creating the decisive tear. Without this trait the self-forgiveness beat collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Kwan Yin’s Tear appears in every collection beat and reappears as the hundredth drop that dissolves the seal; its liquid-starfire image recharges the final portal. Removing it deletes both engine and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Shadow work is not theme but method: each photograph demands acknowledgment of buried guilt, directly enabling key collection. Final opening is impossible without integrated darkness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Gravitational lightness enables her glide to the observation deck for the final pour; happiness-as-thrust is seeded early and used tactically at climax.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stitching paces each admission of shadow and anchors the final renunciation knot; the needle’s rest signals closure. Swap to knitting and the meditative cadence breaks.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The shimmer mechanics are taught early, drive every tear extraction, and charge the final dissolution; without this precise method the dimension stays locked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Recycled hull supplies the photographs and the observation deck portal; its cathedral metaphor frames the spiritual-mechanical fusion. relocation to planet surface breaks logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Post-last-human setting motivates Mei Lin’s solitary task and denies her cryogenic escape, tightening stakes; the clock is her lifetime, lived in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Unlocking the dimension is stated early and every tear collection narrows the remaining gap; the hundredth tear is the on-page decisive act that opens it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Ghostly resolve—quiet, luminous, haunted—pervades diction from “cathedral of salvaced memories” to “liquid starfire,” modulating into release at the end.</comment>
