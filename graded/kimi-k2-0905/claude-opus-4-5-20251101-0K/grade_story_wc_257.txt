<comment>Elara’s shift from frozen grief to deliberate mentorship feels lived-in: the calloused fingers, the cot under the cracked dome, the moment she “whispers to her students” while holding a locket of hair and seed all embody contradictory impulses (clinging/releasing) in scene. The interiority avoids therapy-speak, using tactile memory instead of labels. Micro-choices—folding the first clumsy crane, handing the second to a stranger—earn her eventual return to craft. The final stance (carrying grief into making) is renunciation-with-cost, though the off-page “rock-bottom” eviction is summarized, not dramatized, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the image of Elara descending with fresh vellum while starlight pours through the cracked dome reconfigures meaning—healing is “genuinely artificial” until it becomes real—at visible cost (she still aches, still folds). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane adds density, the stencil’s pattern re-weights at the end. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (observatory, cracked dome, twilight). No meaningful escalation break; the single deepening (teaching others) is sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<comment>The observatory’s cracked dome and abandoned instruments constrain every move—sleeping under the lens, folding on instrument tables—charging the final image where starlight literally pours through the breaks. Timelessness is shown through perpetual twilight and the eviction notice as the only calendar, never exposition. Sensory selection stays urgent: brass mount chill, paper crease sound, starlight warmth on skin. The micro-setting (vellum stencil) acts as tool-as-setting, its constellation pattern guiding the climax.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can grief be re-made into communal healing without erasing loss? Pressure tightens once: Elara’s first crane is clumsy, her last is carried toward a new visitor—her agency narrows options from isolation to responsibility. Cost is felt: she forfeits numbness, accepts the ache of teaching. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is externalized through folded paper recruiting the living.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the stencil’s paradox: a machine-learned chrysanthemum-constellation that teaches humans to grieve. “Curtains of intention” remain subtext, never sermonized; the final starlight-through-cracks image reweights the premise—brokenness allows illumination. No tidy moral, only the acceptance that artificial rituals can grow authentic roots. The emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than uplift, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias: stars as clocks, paper as pulse, stencil as map. Syntax grows leaner under stress—“She picked up her tools, not to escape grief but to carry it forward”—mirroring her shift from numbness to action. No dialogue, so voice purity is judged on narrative texture alone; register remains consistent, never drifts into editorial. The final line’s sibilants (“secret promise that withering”) echo crane-fold whispers, a rhythmic callback.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “starlight poured through the damaged sections” does triple duty—image, emotion, theme. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (chrysanthemum→constellation) and payoff at closure. Minor overwriting in one clause (“slow rotation of stars through its cracked dome”) is forgiven because it teaches the pattern that later reweights.</comment>

<comment>The mourning-jewelry maker who abandons her craft, then re-invents it to “teach withering to bloom,” is a fresh synthesis of grief-craft and star-mapped healing. Origami cranes with GPS coordinates folded by a tattoo-stencil blueprint feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprising on first read. Risk is taken: grief-as-astronomy, machine-made constellation as grief manual—and it coheres without gimmick. Specificity (pressed flowers revived in resin, hair-and-seed locket) anchors the concept in lived detail.</comment>
