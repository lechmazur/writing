<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—pride in honest ignorance vs terror of authoring futures—drives every beat; the “gift” vs “call” line crystallizes it. Embodied cost arrives when she finally lifts the quill: steady hand after visible dread, a micro-choice that forecloses pure spectatorship. Professional trait (ignorance cartographer) shapes perception and tactics throughout; no stock labels. Flaw is active, not hedged, and the ending renounces certainty with felt humility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she maps ignorance, she dreads authoring truth; therefore she writes invitation, not prophecy. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses certainty, carries maps down spire; cost is the weight of “humility enough” on the final line. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the moment quill meets page narrows infinite possibility to committed lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake function as pressure apparatus: black mirror reflects her doubt, white ice buries past hubris. Kingfisher quill—blue summer sky this land forgot—contrasts monochrome world and charges final image when she sets it down. Setting constrains action: spiral stairs, stone desk, frigid air limit speed and symbolize ascent toward risk. Spatial choreography clean; no prop drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she author futures without repeating the ancients’ certainty-catastrophe? Pressure tightens when she decides to write “invitation” maps—visible trade-off that forfeits predictive authority. Cost is legible: she carries imperfect pages into dawn, accepting perpetual revision. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals needed for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: maps as humble invitations, not truths. Final image—unbroken ice below, imperfect pages in hand—reweights earlier “ certainty” motif without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; insight earned through concrete quill moment. Ambiguity lingers: kingdom may still freeze, but possibility is now drawable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: “cartographer’s own uncertainty,” “mathematics were imperfect.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, compresses at quill lift, mirroring breath control. Diction within lexicon—no academic register drift. Voice distinct, consistent, no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: “speculation dressed in ink,” “questions dressed as possibilities” compress abstract idea into tactile image. Rhythm varies: long reflective sentences vs clipped “She did not pick it up. Not yet.” No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line earns cadence release: “The future was still unwritten. She had simply made space for it to begin.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography + temporal authorship + humility ethic. Ancients’ buried engine gives mythic resonance without exposition dump. Conceptual risk—writing futures as invitation—paid off in closure. Not a template inversion; specificity of ignorance-cartographer profession anchors novelty.</comment>
