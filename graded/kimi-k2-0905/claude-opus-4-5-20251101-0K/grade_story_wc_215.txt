<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s tranquil perceptiveness is dramatized through her calibrated micro-choices—reading the ghost-mother’s finger-spelled child-outline, opening the box only after the nod—so the trait actively enables the central beat. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final renunciation (keeping the box closed “not yet”) carries visible cost in the tightening of her arms against the desert heat. The only slight slack is the off-stage grandmother oath; because the covenant’s weight is felt on-page via the accumulating stones, the motivation still coheres.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ghost visit layers another “stone” of silence into the box, tightening the density of preserved muteness until the final charged poise—Maren cradling the still-closed box—reweights the stakes. Closure lands cleanly: the box stays shut, the cost is the perpetual custodianship she accepts in the dying light. No loops or missing anchors; orientation is fixed by word 50. The persistent constraint (custodian silence) shapes every tactical choice and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dead orchard’s heat-shimmer and bleached hive boxes aren’t backdrop—they filter what Maren notices (cracked earth = cracked voice), and the stained glass box functions as portable micro-setting that literally constrains her choice to withhold/release words. Final image of gold bees projected across desert walls recharges the orchard’s lost pollinators, marrying setting to theme. One micro-slip: “copper sky” leans generic amid otherwise razor-specific idiom, but it doesn’t dull the closing projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—tightens through each ghost deposition; the mother-ghost’s wordless plea is the visible escalation that forces Maren’s micro-choice to accept another stone. Cost is palpable: forearms bruised by box weight, future labor of eventual delivery. No reversal, but the deepening accumulation under Accumulative lens satisfies the single required intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accruing pattern: silence is not absence but a palpable substance that can be inherited, carried, and someday released. Subtext operates in gesture—the ghost’s finger-child, the box’s reluctance to open—never in exposition. Final image of projected bees pollinating the dead room reconfigures muteness into latent fertility, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual bias: she clocks “heat shimmer,” “translucent tears that vanish,” never external diagnosis. Syntax grows paratactic under pressure—“She opened the box… the ghost was already fading”—mirroring her stripped attentiveness. No head-hopping; diction stays within desert-isolate register. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“Maren felt the weight settle”), serving immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffolds; every sentence doubles duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative layer is spare—“bees in amber and gold” appears once and charges closure; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only one adjective pair could be cut (“weathered hands”), but the density elsewhere is so high the micro-fat does not impede propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—visible ghosts who speak only through gestural clues to a silence-keeper—feels fresh, yet the emotional engine (buried maternal last words) is timeless, yielding inevitability-in-hindsight. Risk: hingeing an entire plot on mute pantomime could have collapsed into gimmick, but the specificity of each ghost’s mime (child-outline, envelope-trace) grounds the concept. Transforms trope of post-apocalyptic wasteland into intimate archive of withheld love letters.</comment>
