<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Veren’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers “never still,” her ache for pattern and belonging is shown through reed-forming micro-choices. The climactic recognition that she sought “being sought” is fully prepared by prior beats; the cost (she will stay, keep shaping, never return to marsh) is felt in the final image. Minor slip: Senna’s orphan backstory is delivered in a single explanatory line rather than discovered through action, nudging motivation toward label-speak for one beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout—each reed sculpture is a deliberate tactic that summons response; the tag accumulates meaning until Senna steps forward, delivering a decisive change with cost (her solitary identity dissolves into communal risk). Closure lands under the obsidian arbor with visible communal cost: Veren’s circle of reeds is incomplete alone, crystallizing the new kinship rule. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within first 80 words.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline orchard is not postcard scenery—its light-fractured heat guides when and where sculptures are left; crater mist supplies the dawn meeting site. Reed itself becomes micro-setting: its fragility mirrors the community’s provisional weave. The obsidian arbor returns as charged closure site; removing it would collapse the communal ritual space. One small over-telling—“the air itself seem wounded with beauty”—is filtered through Veren’s perception and thus forgivable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—belonging through strange gift—signals early; each reed offering tightens the bargain: “notice me / find me.” Escalation is accumulative: symbols appear → sculptures answer → nightly vigil grows; the final tightening occurs when Senna steps into the circle, foreclosing perpetual anonymity at the cost of exposure. Cost is visible: her dust-stained fingers tremble; Veren will keep shaping forever, accepting perpetual outsider role inside the orchard. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “kinship as incomplete weave” emerges solely through reed circles, tag web, and final communal circle; no character ever names it. Subtext operates in silence—Senna’s first spoken words appear only at climax, revealing the ache behind the tag. Final image reweights prior reed forms: they were not art but invitations. The refusal to offer tidy moral (“this is how to belong”) lets ambiguity linger while closure still lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, compressed diction—“land remembered,” “wounded with beauty”—is taught early and remains legible. Perceptual signature is Veren-specific: she sees light as “heat,” trees as “glass,” bodies as “almost-touching”; no POV slippage. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for crater vistas, staccato for sculpting motion. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic—“I shape reeds” carries subtext of identity refusal. Final paragraph’s luminescent ache is earned by prior pattern, not tacked on.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphoric charge) without overcrowding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors stay internally coherent—crater mist as “iridescent,” arbor veins as “captured starlight”—no mixed logic. High information density: one sentence gives season, terrain, Veren’s vocation, and emotional premise. Final line cadence mirrors circular reed forms, achieving textural payoff without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of street-art mystery with mineral orchard is fresh; the tag-as-web conceit turns graffiti into orphan signal. Reed sculpture as relational technology feels specific to this world. Risk—quiet accumulative reveal instead of confrontation—pays off through earned stasis. The “luminescent ache” tonal gamble could have slid into preciousness but is grounded by tactile reed dust and trembling fingers. Slight proximity to “outsider artist joins commune” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
