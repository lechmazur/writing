<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—desire for normalcy vs. need to hear plants—are dramatized in her first micro-choice to flee surgery; her refusal to surrender the telepathy shows visible cost when Thomas’s grief face appears. Interiority stays embodied (palms on frost, coffee-ring fortune) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final “sand began to fall” crystallizes earned stasis: she locks herself into a path that forfeits medical safety yet accepts the miracle’s price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: failed surgery → flight → tunnel choice; hourglass sand finally dropping supplies Decisive Change with felt cost (no going back to doctors). Coffee-ring map and plant intel are seeded early; orientation anchors inside 120 words (tower, dawn, hourglass). One causality bump: “the plants know” is asserted rather than demonstrated once, but it pays off when ivy guides the tunnel, so minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tower, frost, dawn, and coffee rings are filtered through Mira’s bias; the hourglass operates as micro-setting that constrains her final choice when sand moves. Spatial choreography clean (desk → doorway → garden passage). Sensory hierarchy favors tactile cold and whispered greens, not tourist visuals. One missed beat: caverns beneath monastery are named but not sensory-anchored; since closure occurs above ground, no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the plant telepathy vs. lose it—signaled in line 1; meaningful tightening when Mira decides to tunnel out before second surgery. Cost is legible: forfeiting medical safety, embracing underground uncertainty. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates (fern senses approach) but does not resolve. Persistent constraint—the still-running plant channel—shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “closure as careful wound-opening” emerges through coffee rings, scars, and the choice to tunnel into literal wounds beneath the monastery. Subtext carries in gesture: Thomas’s slow exhale reveals he sees Mira’s path as suicide. Final image of falling sand reweights the miracle from stasis to irreversible motion—no moral, only cost. No thematic echo; insight stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual signature: synesthetic plant whispers, circular time in coffee stains. Syntax lengthens under anesthesia fog, then tightens—“sand began to fall”—for the crystallizing beat. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is inferred solely through Mira’s watch. Diction stays within Mira’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulation evident: hush-heavy dawn vs. subterranean urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long anesthetic sentences contract into clipped flight beats. High information density—“closure seeker, traveling to families broken by loss” compresses mother’s career in one vivid line. No mixed metaphors; frosted hourglass and meteor hush coexist. One minor scaffold: “the surgery was supposed to...” clause repeats cadence twice, but occurs early, not in closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing plant telepathy with closure-reading coffee stains feels inevitable, not gimmicky; both traffic in circular time. Hourglass frozen by meteor strike displaces miracle into wrong garden—fresh trope twist. Risk taken: lyric accumulation over plot reversals; pays off in charged final image. Could swap monastery caverns for any ruin, so slight freshness loss, but tower-garden-hourglass triad is particular.</comment>
