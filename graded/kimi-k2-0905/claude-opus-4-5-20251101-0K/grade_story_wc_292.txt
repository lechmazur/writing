<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tremble, the nail warms—but the “idealistic map librarian” tag is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her choose maps or ideology under fire. The ancestral motive is vivid, yet her moment of agency (“She would make them listen”) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost feels announced rather than paid. Still, contradictory impulses (dread vs. hope) coexist in one breath, satisfying the 9+ test for interior tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the satellite-phone image crystallizes a new future with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: because Elena coded the truth, because Mira decoded it, therefore Torres acts. One micro-turn—Torres’s face shifting from “skepticism to dread”—tightens stakes without breaking continuity. The 14-month ticking clock is declared, not dramatized, a soft escalation that keeps this from 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The experimental weather station is sketched with selective, urgent detail—reinforced glass groaning, sensors blinking—while the copper nail serves as micro-setting that literally warms against skin, constraining Mira’s posture and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is invisible (no body-tracking), but the confined room plus outside storm creates a coherent pressure vessel. Cape Ruin is named early, anchoring time/place without tourist exposition. The setting subtly guides choice: only here can the coded journals interface with live data, making the station indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing global weather catastrophe—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Mira translates “reversible exile” into a 14-month countdown. Agency is intellectual, not physical: she chooses to question Torres, forcing the satellite-phone action that forecloses secrecy. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—the world’s coastal populations remain abstract—so pressure is strong but not yet painful on the page. Still, the causal linkage (decode → warn → phone) cleanly escalates under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: ignored women’s knowledge finally reweights the future. The copper nail’s warming reprises ancestral bravery without moralizing; the final image of “winds that carry their own undoing” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No character states the thesis; subtext lives in gesture—Torres’s hand reaching for the phone. Complexity lingers: the same cycle will return in 300 years, so victory is partial, not tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual filter—“spongey dread,” “nervous confidence”—with no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors pressure: short clauses when she decodes, longer accumulations when explaining stakes. Diction is precise yet character-bound; no academic register drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in Torres’s single skeptical question. Final image (“winds…promise of their own undoing”) is rhythmically controlled, recharging earlier motif without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs are strong—“glass groaned,” “nail warmed”—avoiding filter-verb stacks. One minor scaffold: “the expression she’d perfected during grant applications” could compress to “her grant-application smile,” but the rhythm breathes naturally. Closure line is crystalline, undiluted by ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—librarian + coded war-poetry + climate sci-fi—is fresh, not a checklist. Elena’s 300-year reversible exile concept reimagines jet-stream chaos through overlooked women’s archives, transforming familiar eco-disaster tropes. Risk is taken: intellectual climax over physical, yet stakes feel large because the premise commits fully. Proximity check: no echoes of famous scenes; the copper nail as archival relic carries idiosyncratic weight.</comment>
