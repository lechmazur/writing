<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—grief-driven witness vs. complicit legacy—ramifies in every micro-choice (tapping, atlas touch, transmission). The cost is embodied: eleven years of misdirected guilt crystallize into the night-long act of exposure she can’t undo. The grandmother’s silence is a credible, inherited flaw that compounds the mistake; the ending neither forgives nor absolves, leaving Marina moored to irreversible disclosure. No stock therapy-speak; the rhythmic tapping stays idiosyncratic and stakes-scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the transmitted coordinates rewrite scientific and personal history at visible emotional cost—“trembling hands,” “whatever reckoning it would bring.” The Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of returns, resurfacing data) holds; final image of the fluttering torn atlas page reweights all prior graphs. Causality is tight: grandmother’s hidden barrels → Marina’s misread bleaching → night transmission; no retro-fixes. Orientation anchored by word 78; disorientation serves the emerging oceanic palimpsest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The station’s sway and pontoons, the vent-breath on the atlas, the salt-stained console are tactile constraint-tools that shape Marina’s tapping rhythms and final transmission posture. Sensory economy is fierce: “bone-white graveyards” packs visual, moral, and acoustic punch in three words. Geography is coherent—no floating rooms; the disappearing route lines are spatially tracked on the single torn page. Final image of paper flutter against fixed horizon charges the reconfiguration without extra description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why the routes vanished—tightens when personal culpability overlays climate narrative. The mid-story micro-turn: “Every bleaching site overlays dumping grounds” narrows Marina’s options from scientist to whistle-blower with undeniable reputational/familial cost. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves it. Persistent constraint: the poison lies beneath her own sampled reefs, forcing the通宵 transmission that ends the piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intergenerational environmental guilt encoded in oceanic silence. No moralizing—final reckoning is left drifting, mirroring the “patient breathing” sea. The torn atlas page and tapping rhythm reprice knowledge itself as contaminated legacy. Grandmother’s handwritten apology and Marina’s transmission fuse private and planetary guilt into one indelible aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: Marina’s world is felt through fingertip percussion—wood, paper, glass—creating a phonograph of grief. Compression taught early: “periodically eternal” and “creature that had forgotten how to swim” prime the reader for lyric density that never drops clarity. No head-hopping; temporal slips (“had documented”) are motivated by archival drive. Final cadence—“whatever reckoning it would bring”—modulates to propulsive anticipation without leaving the established rhythmic palette.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear is varied: long anacrusis sentences crash into staccato taps, mirroring wave pulses. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new layer (data, memory, corrosion). Metaphors stay physically coherent—“ocean had been taught to avoid its own wounds.” Information density peaks in the single line “toxins leaching upward in plumes invisible to satellites,” doing world-building, plot twist, and sensory cue simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of climate grief with illicit-dump noir feels non-obvious and specific; the “disappearing shipping route” angle revitalizes eco-fiction trope. Transformation test fails if relocated—the coral-plus-cover-up symbiosis is inseparable from this station, this coast. Risky lyric ellipses (“periodically eternal”) pay off by charging the final silence. Slight familiarity in the guilty-ancestor device keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
