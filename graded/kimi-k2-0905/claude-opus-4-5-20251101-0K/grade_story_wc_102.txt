<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mei-Lin’s quiet certainty and the bodily cue of the trembling camera anchor her vocation; the monk memory arriving “three nights ago” is accepted without visible present-tense cost, so the interior contradiction stays thin. The micro-choice—offering the old woman the lens—carries gentle status inversion (artist→healer) and is enough renunciation to earn the ending’s poise. No secondary pressure from another on-page character, but the single-POY design meets scope. Interiority avoids label-speak, keeps idiosyncratic light-vision.

<comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration: the released breath sparks visibly ascend, charging the jasmine image and reweighting the “where unused love goes” question. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens: every beat adds luminous residue until the fog/jasmine matrix crystallizes it. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the camera’s next frame must now contain that absent light. One micro-turn (dark→luminous breath) is sufficient tightening for this length.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct, jasmine, fog, and wooden camera form a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the only channel through which love can be vented. Amber jasmine glow and watercolor ambiguity are filtered through Mei-Lin’s light-hunter gaze; every sensory pick is purposive, never catalog. Spatial choreography holds: camera-box, inverted lens, archway fog, upward-spirals all track cleanly. Tool-as-setting charges the final image: the camera must record the now-changed air, cementing the setting’s causal role.</comment>

<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—is signaled early and tightens when Mei-Lin decides to intervene with the old woman, narrowing her role from observer to conduit. Pressure grows accumulatively: each exhalation adds density until the breath-pattern finally breaks, a valid Textural escalation. No visible personal cost to Mei-Lin keeps the score shy of 8.8, but the conceptual cost (she must now carry the next spark-trail) is legible. Agency is attention/ritual, not physical risk, fitting lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and ritual: love as particulate matter that can be photographed and exhaled. The jasmine-fog matrix re-priced at closure turns the philosophical question into visible upward spirals without moralizing. Subtext of forgiveness is left ambiguous—“not precisely true”—inviting counter-readings. Final image offers non-literal answer: released love becomes light the artist must forever chase, a charged poise that resonates beyond plot.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp: Mei-Lin notices halos of exhalation, inverted skies, jasmine glow—no tourist catalog. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to imperatives (“Breathe out…”) under pressure. Compression taught early (“pilgrim of sparks”) and paid off in final spirals. No dialogue contamination; single POV distance held. One clause drifts toward thesis-speak—“she had come to believe”—but is earned by prior pattern, so no penalty.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence starts avoid template cadence. High density: each sentence layers light, breath, and memory duties. Metaphors stay coherent (jasmine=prayer, fog=ambiguity) and never collide. One minor scaffold: “she would continue her pilgrimage tomorrow” summarizes forward motion that could have been cut, but it occurs post-closure and does not dull image.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Core fusion—camera obscura + breath-healing + unused-love geography—feels fresh yet inevitable. Monk past-life and jade pendant could have tipped into trope but are grounded in sensory drowning and river mud. Risk of quiet accumulative structure is embraced and paid off with visible spark-spiral. Transformation test fails: remove Mei-Lin’s light-vision and the story collapses, proving specificity. No close echoes; idiosyncratic image set is memorable.</comment>
