<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. aching need to hold presence—are embodied in the trembling pocket-sun flare; the final renunciation of “capture” for “participation” is earned by the shell-to-handoff causality and costs her the safety of certainty. Theo functions as a crucible, forcing the micro-choice to surrender the shell; his seven-year witness gives the parting weight. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “scientifically romantic” is shown via calibrated starlight and logarithmic spirals rather than asserted. Only minor cap: the mother grief beat is late and summary, muting the deepest flaw driver.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira re-weights her premise from “trap time” to “pay attention,” with felt cost—she relinquishes the shell and the protective illusion of objectivity. Causal lens holds: pocket-sun flare → shell surrender → parting mandate; each beat narrows her option set. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (ember nexus, twilight, two bodies). No teleporting props; shell and sun track cleanly. One hairline slip: “palette of resolve” is named once without prior setup, but the image is immediately re-practiced on-page, so lens integrity survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: the pocket-sun’s corona and nautilus columella literally constrain the final choice—handing over the shell dims the sun, signaling consent to change. Heat shimmer, sulfurous air, and magma chorus are filtered through Mira’s alchemical gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: Theo’s shadow crosses the bench, shell passes hand-to-hand, distances hold. Environment mirrors internal shift (nexus cools as she lets go), yet avoids overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she keep presence without destroying it?—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: Theo voices the real fear (“You want to understand why we can’t stay”), forcing her to trade capture for participation; shell transfer is the visible price. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each calibration of the pocket-sun raises emotional temperature until the flare forces relinquishment. No coincidence; no abstract stakes—loss of the shell is concrete. Cost is legible; persistent constraint established (she leaves without her talisman).</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: presence is not a substance to bottle but a quality of attention paid together. Subtext lives in gesture—shell pressed into Theo’s palm replaces any declaration of love. Final image re-weights every prior measurement metaphor without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; “density of presence” is interrogated, not preached. Complexity honored: leaving may fail; staying might have failed—both truths coexist in charged poise.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature: logarithmic spirals, half-lives, starlight wavelengths. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat—rhythmic control evident. No head-hop; Theo’s interior accessed only via readable externals. Diction stays within alchemist lexicon; “ember nexus,” “pocket-sun” feel native, not grafted. Voice remains distinct even in peak emotional flare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and causal push. No paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—corona, spiral, column—forming a closed set that culminates in the dimming sun. Minor scaffold: “scientifically romantic” appears once as label; does not recur. Final line earns cadence stop without drumbeat monotony. Clean copy, zero typos.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical star-craft meets grief-work via nautilus geometry—trope combination feels inevitable yet unseen. Risk taken in quiet, conceptual climax rather than explosive event; risk heightens coherence. Specificity throughout—pocket-sun calibration steps, columella density readings—prevents generic overlay. If names and places changed, the emotional mathematics would collapse; thus transformation test passed.</comment>
