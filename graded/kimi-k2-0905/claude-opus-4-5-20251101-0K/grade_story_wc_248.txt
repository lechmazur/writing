<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Miriam’s contradictory drives—guilt vs. ancestral summons—are embodied in the controlled burn and the tremor as she touches her own ancient face. The micro-choice to torch the library rather than surrender the journals crystallizes her hierarchy of loyalties with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific (“archaeologist of the desperate”). Closure is earned: she accepts irrevocable exile above-ground to keep the promise, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Miriam beneath the vandalized portrait, weeping with a grief that “could have melted stone,” reconfigures her exile into homecoming and her criminal act into rescue. The causal lens holds throughout: arson → flight → descent → genetic revelation. A persistent constraint (she can never resurface) is cemented in the final line. Cost is unmistakable and emotionally scaled to the piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The volcanic cathedral of whispers, the stone alcove protecting the chest, and the scratched-out eyes of her own likeness all constrain her next move—she can only stay and inherit. Sensory selection is urgent: headlamp as sole light source, temperature shifts read as text. Micro-setting (the vandalized portrait) literally charges the final image. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within the first 90 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise or be swallowed by ordinary guilt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when demolition forces the burn. Escalation is causal: each because/therefore linkage strips away external options until only descent remains. The final narrowing is the irrevocable cost of surfacing. Price is visible and felt, though the middle beat could sharpen one tactical loss (tool, time, social credit) to reach the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: ancestral memory encoded in pigment and ash, the impossibility of erasing a face that keeps reappearing. The vandalized eyes become a silent answer to the question of whether forgetting is mercy or betrayal. Subtext in the letter (“some promises take lifetimes to rescue from forgetting”) reweights the concept of rescue without moralizing. Final image of weeping beneath her own marred likeness offers a resonant, non-literal answer to inherited belonging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is volcanic—compressed, hot, exact: “love so fierce it threatened destruction, so quiet it barely disturbed the air.” Perceptual signature is analytic yet sensorily acute (“cataloging every temperature shift”). Rhythm accelerates into fragmentary breathlessness during descent, then widens into cathedral hush at the portrait. No dialogue to contaminate; internal diction stays within a twenty-four-year-old autodidact’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new information or emotional charge. Metaphors are volcanic, coherent, and paid off: ash, cinders, melted stone. Information density is high—three months off-grid, seventeen-year tapestry fragment, genealogical wall of art—yet clarity remains. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from urgent staccato to reverent long vowels in the final paragraph without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The genetic palimpsest portrait-gallery is a fresh angle on the “hidden archive” trope; the burn-the-library-to-save-it inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors novelty: tapestry fragment scrawled with coordinates, temperature-shift reading as text. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced but controlled, heightening stakes without obscuring causality. The transformation test fails if relocated—this exact volcanic bloodline cathedral is irreplaceable.</comment>
