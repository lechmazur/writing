<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—telepathic caretaker vs. insurgent resistor—collide in every beat; her cracked voice singing the seed free is the earned, irreversible cost that forecloses retreat and fuses memory to future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality holds: because chemical war awakened plant communion, therefore moss→kite→song→seed; the glass dissolving into mineral powder is the visible Decisive Change with conceptual cost—tradition now grafted onto reconstruction concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Heat-veiled volcanic pools constrain every move—steam hides patrols, minerals cut skin, glass seals the seed; the embryo’s amber warms against her chest in the final image, recharging all prior geothermal whispers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve sacred memory inside rebuilt infrastructure—tightens once: singing shatters the glass and forecloses anonymity; the audible mineral dust is the felt price that reweights the stake under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges unspoken: memory must be thermally remade, not merely conserved; the seed’s germination beneath future concrete offers a resonant, non-moral answer—tradition will grow through, not against, reconstruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, compressed diction mirrors steam—“the plants fell silent, listening”—with aging-singer rasp; no head-hop; patterned elision (kite symbols→song) taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: every sentence layers geology, politics, and botany; opener anchors voice and stakes, final line crystallizes forward motion; metaphors (glass→powder) obey volcanic physics, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Plant-telepathic insurgent grandmother who sings lost scripture to shatter geologic glass fuses fresh angles; transformation test fails if relocated—volcanic seed sealed by song is inseparable from Kaluuma’s hot-spring cosmology.</comment>
