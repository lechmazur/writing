<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing value while doubting his own—are dramatized in the micro-gesture of reciting specs to armor grief; the final micro-choice to follow Val toward the carved names earns the closure by trading appraisal distance for participatory risk, cost visible in the relinquished cloth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: viral humiliation → flight to quarry → cloth trigger → recognition of transformed purpose; the Orientation Test is met by word 80; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—‘purpose doesn’t disappear, it transforms’—with the quarry now re-weighted from void to resonant vessel, cost legible in Marcus’s surrendered grip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limestone dust on aluminum siding, condensation wiped with the back of a hand, speaker cloth coarse between thumb and forefinger—tactile triangulation roots us; the inverted amphitheater quarry constrains the final choice by offering only descent or departure, its absent stone charging the echo metaphor that closes the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering self-worth after public collapse—tightens when the cloth forces Marcus to test his ‘facts as armor’ method against Val’s lived loss; the tightening is single but sufficient, foreclosing retreat to the trailer and raising the cost of continued emotional insulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resonance-after-silence emerges through the cloth’s microscopic stress patterns and quarry carvings seen only by dawn light; no moral is stated—the final image of sky revealed by removed stone reconfigures absence as vessel, letting the reader feel the conceptual cost of hollowing to hear echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual filter—roadie lexicon, appraisal jargon, quarry dust on skin; rhythmic compression under stress (“Facts were armor. Facts didn’t ask…”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final stripped sentence, no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety propels: opening long image, staccato reflective fragments, climactic parallel “After the applause…”; only minor scaffold—“He turned the cloth over, confidently uncertain…” re-states prior beat—kept from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Viral-shame exile meets quarry acoustics in a synthesis that feels inevitable; the inverted amphitheater as post-performance life is fresh, not gimmick, and the cloth’s micro-history turns a rock-world cliché into specific, earned metaphor.</comment>
