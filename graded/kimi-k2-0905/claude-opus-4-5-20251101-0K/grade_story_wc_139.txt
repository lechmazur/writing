<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya’s never-lie trait is embodied in micro-choices (the single-word answer “No,” the insistence on “I chose”), and her contradictory hunger for clean transactions collides with the moment she accepts the weighted ink pot; the final endurance—carrying stolen history home—pays the cost of her father’s flaws in visible silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink pot’s transfer re-weights three generations of debt into “even,” and Maya’s mathematics is rewritten from balance to transformation; causality holds under a single Causal lens, with every beat (asylum-for-theft, dying-for-return) tightening the ethical screw until the final image liquefies rigid ledgers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prep-room micro-setting rules every beat: arterial fluid scent, steel counter, fluorescent-lit corpse—these constrain dialogue distance, object handling, and moral tone; the ink pot’s cloudy glass is returned to like a compass, charging the final image as it catches streetlight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ethical accounting exist for inherited theft—tightens once when Maya refuses to lie yet accepts the stolen pot; the reversal is her conscious switch from sent to choosing, forcing her to shoulder irreversible cost; escalation is coherent, single-curve, and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: fair trades don’t balance, they transform; subtext lives in silence—Mr. Chen’s waiting, Maya’s unspoken mathematics, the corpse as mute witness; the final line’s paradoxical algebra lingers as earned wisdom rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person POV stays tight; perceptual signature—chemical perfume of death, alibi mathematics, anomaly child—remains consistent; no head-hop; diction stays within Maya’s plausible lexicon; rhythmic compression under stress (“He asked. I chose.”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty (ink pot as both heirloom and tax); no scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse, precise (“death dressed in chemical perfume”); opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; zero mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing con-artist legacy with embalming ink pot and asylum stakes feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope harvesting; specificity (three generations, Shanghai grandfather) prevents transplant to any other names; final mathematics of transformation is a non-obvious synthesis that could not be swapped out.</comment>
