<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory drives—scientist’s detachment vs. lone savior—are alive in her micro-choices (welding the door, tuning the dish, scanning fresh charts). Her flaw (obsessive vigilance) both enables the win and costs her any future peace, shown in the ghost-reflection on the scope. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak, and the final beat crystallizes earned isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she decoded the pattern she could build the counter-transmitter; because she broadcast dissonance the cult falters and the signal fractures. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “most human sound” of silence reweights all prior static and sets a permanent watch. Cost is felt in the welded door, the 11:58 breaching, and her reflection “not quite earthbound.” No orientation debt; stakes telegraph by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basement coffin of “burnt coffee and old electronics” constrains movement and mirrors Mira’s burned stamina; the transmitter she cobbled from “salvaged parts” becomes the micro-setting that enables/closes the plot. Charts flutter under EM field—objects acted upon, not described—so the tool charges the final image. Spatial track stays clean: door weld, console reach, window watch, all anchored without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent community self-immolation—tightens when the board’s midnight demo vote gives her 47 min. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the beings are “farmers” of discord reframes her task from defense to sabotage. Agency remains causal: her counter-broadcast directly fractures the procession and the alien pattern. Price is legible—she forfeits normal life, welded inside a soon-to-be-razed tomb.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge without consensus is its own exile. Subtext in “voices that weren’t even real” implicates all mass-media manipulation, not just cosmic ones. Final silence reconfigures the earlier static motif—noise meant violence, silence means fragile peace. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone believe her? avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Detached, scientific diction (“concentric circles,” “gravity lens”) stays inside an astrophysicist’s lexicon; syntax grows clipped under EM pressure (“Good.”). Perceptual signature is strongly particular—she notices declination lines in candlelight, feels subsonics “in the liquid of her eyes.” No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue (Morrison shout) is brief, goal-driven, subtext of institutional panic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences weld world, stake, and tool (“Frankenstein creation… stolen lab equipment”). Rhythm breathes—long cuff of exposition, then staccato beats under broadcast hum. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors; “ghosting across the screen” is precise, not purple. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts carry visual urgency. Copy-clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Alien-invasion trope flipped into agriculture-of-strife metaphor; subsonic “grammar” as emotional malware feels novel yet inevitable. Specific astro-detail (Proxima relay, declination annotations) grounds cosmic horror in campus basement. Risk in 2nd-person-less static warfare pays off with sensory stakes (bones, teeth). Synthesis is idiosyncratic enough that swapping Mira’s discipline would collapse the logic.</comment>
