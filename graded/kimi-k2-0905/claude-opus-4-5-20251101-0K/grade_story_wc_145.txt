<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory mix of cartographic rigor and emotional abandonment is dramatized: her red-pen atlas corrections versus the silence of wife and daughter, both given embodied weight in the same breath. The micro-choice to draw the falcon’s condensation-route on the glass turns abstract obsession into tactile action. Final “Earned Stasis” renunciation—walking onto ice that may kill her—pays the accumulated cost of every prior map-lie. Minor slip: “competence had never been enough to make her lovable” drifts toward diagnostic summary; still, interior contradiction is otherwise viscerally shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Situational lens: accumulating environmental pressure (falcon, ice window, ticking freeze) crystallizes into a single stance—keep walking. Closure is Charged Poise: “the silence held. Maren kept walking” reconfigures stakes without thawing danger; conceptual cost (possible death for truth) is undeniable. Causality intact: falcon’s return → confirms passage → triggers departure; no teleport or luck. Orientation anchored by 75 words; no debt. One causal micro-turn inside the scene suffices at 700 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, antenna tower, and ice-pane window all constrain the final choice—she literally steps onto the lake she studied. Condensation micro-setting becomes predictive instrument, charging closure. Sensory economy favors touch (ice groan, jess crystals) over panoramic vistas. Falcon as living tool reframes map-as-theory into blood-guided fact; no scenery dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map truth versus survival—tightens when falcon confirms the three-day ice window; clock is legible. Agency: she decides to herald correction, forfeiting safe return. Cost is felt: “twelve days… file the revised coordinates anyway” drafts her own obituary. No artificial antagonist needed; terrain as indifferent pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—naming versus being, maps versus memory—emerges through concrete motif: wrongly translated Evenki “headwaters” vs true “where water remembers its purpose.” Final image of vanishing breath clouds reweights earlier phrasebook error without moralizing. Subtext in Volkov’s almost-smile implies complicity in abandonment. No tidy answer; ambiguity lingers whether truth justifies death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: cartographer’s diction—“atlas,” “coordinate,” “watershed scars”—threads every observation. Rhythm compresses under decision: paratactic “The ice held. The silence held.” mirrors breath puffs. Free indirect cleanly fuses with physical action; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue sparse, indirection sharp: “You make it sound noble” / “I make it sound necessary.” No head-hop; lens steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion high: each clause either charts environment or sharpens interior contradiction. Figurative control: “rusted outpost… ashamed of itself” gives architecture emotional stakes without mixed metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “herald the correction”—mirrors protagonist’s precision obsession, so allowed. Final line cadence earns its quiet uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Falcon-guided river tracing reverses usual explorer trope: bird as living atlas, ice as shifting text. Evenki mistranslation hook freshens “source of river” quest into linguistically ethical quest. Risk: quiet ending on white expanse could feel familiar, yet breath-cloud erasure is specific to her map-logic worldview. Transformation intact: swap atlas-editor or location and entire emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
