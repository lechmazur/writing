<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret’s interior contradiction—yearning for legacy yet recoiling from its cost—remains embodied in the crank handle’s weight and the silent tears. The micro-choice to keep turning the empty platter externalizes her willingness to hear what ancestors denied. Cost is legible: she forfeits the comfort of inherited myth and accepts the burden of reparative silence. One decimal off 9+ only because the grandmother’s “eloquent silence” is asserted more than dramatized in present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty’s value is inverted on-page when Margaret chooses the moth-gray manual over fortune, felt cost in the “warm paths” of tears. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber→purple dusk, slowing platter, and silence itself accrete until meaning reweights. No causality breaks; every beat is linked by “listening” pressure. Persistent constraint established: the standing-wave room will henceforth demand truthful silence from her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sepia reading room is not backdrop; the gramophone, moth-gray book, and shifting golden shadows physically constrain attention and finally determine the closing choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hand→crank→platter→book, no floating props. Light transition from honey to purple tracks internal reconfiguration and charges the final image. Micro-setting (the crank handle) literally mediates the epiphany, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or dismantle the Ashworth myth—tightens when silence “speaks” the atrocities. One meaningful deepening: the empty spinning platter turns curiosity into culpability. Agency is renunciation rather than action, but cost is visible (tears, forfeited inheritance of meaning). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: every golden surface hides bone dust. The final image of Margaret opening the wordless book reweights “eloquent silence” from family eccentricity to ethical method. No moralizing—theme stays implicit in light shift and emptied platter. Resonance lingers because the reader must likewise listen to silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains fused to Margaret’s perceptual filter: “amber light pooled like honey” is her momentary metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens then fragments as attention unfocuses into intuition, mirroring the platter’s deceleration. No head-hopping; grandmother’s consciousness is inferred only through Margaret’s interpretation. Voice is distinct without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or decision. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition”—never stacked. High information density: one clause often performs description, metaphor, and causality. Final line lands with crystalline brevity after prior controlled cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar “family discovers its sins” arc is refreshed by standing-wave epistemology and the empty gramophone as truth engine. Risk taken: climax is silent listening, yet tension holds. Specificity of moth-gray wordless book and crank handle prevents generic swap-out. Not quite 9+ because core revelation (mines, child labor) is historically common, though delivery is novel.</comment>
