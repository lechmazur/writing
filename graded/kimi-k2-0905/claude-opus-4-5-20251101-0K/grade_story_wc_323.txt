<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vara’s career-long identity as navigation instructor is credibly upended; her micro-choice to set down the chain link crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays concrete—‘weight…limitation’ felt in palm—without therapy-speak. One flaw: Tessek’s interior is ventriloquised (‘something like sorrow’) which nicks POV purity, but the human core holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chain abandoned under star-geometry re-weights her worldview with undeniable cost. Drive lens is Accumulative—star patterns tighten texture until cadence flips. Orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered. Micro-turn at ‘horizons unfold’ narrows options—earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The benthic city is not backdrop; its light-bent dome literally refracts the final comprehension. Volcanic spires/biolum coral are selective, not tourist list, and filter through Vara’s pilot-eye priorities. Spatial choreography immaculate—helmet lamp, crystal dome, chain placed on floor—objects tracked. Anchor-chain as micro-setting constrains her letting go—qualifies 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender terrestrial navigation for star-geometry?—is signaled early. One tightening: realization that ‘horizons unfold’ forces the discard of the chain; cost is the lifetime identity she must unpick. Agency is internal yet forecloses path—sufficient for 600-word scale. No coincidence; escalation is texture-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: anchoring to stars instead of bottom. No moral sermon; final image of ‘tracing edges’ re-prices prior coastal charts without stating thesis. Subtext pulses in Tessek’s color-shift and silent offering of chain. Complexity acknowledged—‘oceans of understanding waited’—avoids tidy uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice carries pilot’s disciplined perceptual signature—‘read coastlines and currents’—yet yields to wonder. Free indirect clean; no head-hop. Diction stays within Vara’s lexicon until ‘conceptual repricing’-level abstraction at close, justified by scalar epiphany. Rhythm breathes: long sentence of star-geometry collapses into clipped ‘She set the chain link down.’</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances knowledge or image. Metaphor density high but taught early—‘cathedral of shadows’—and paid off in dome reveal. No mixed vehicles; volcanic stone & coral remain coherent. Information density: one line can anchor setting, mood, and thematic tilt simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Benthic star-navigation via edge-geometry is fresh synthesis of familiar first-contact trope. Risk taken with quiet, internal climax rather than spectacle; coherence maintained. Specificity of ‘edge geometry’ as mathematical refraction pathway prevents swappability. Not transformed enough for 9+ but feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
