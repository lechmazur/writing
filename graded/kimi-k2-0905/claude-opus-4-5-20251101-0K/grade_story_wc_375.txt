<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—her charcoal-stained fingers, the throat tightening at the canvas—and the contradiction between memorized duty and repressed creation pulses throughout. The final act of drawing is credibly earned by the generational weight she literally touches (the lock, the letter, the half-face). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived; the “ghost” portraits function as pressure, not people. Flaw: the epiphany edges toward tidy articulation (“sorrow and creation were the same breath”), slightly diagnostic in the last paragraph, trimming the apex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two new drawings beside the abandoned canvas visibly reconfigure meaning and carry felt generational cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated sensory returns to violet crystal light and locked-away art until the pattern breaks with the first charcoal stroke. Causality is interior but coherent: grandmother’s lock → father’s prohibition → Maren’s surrender, each cause a psychic inheritance. Orientation is secure by line 4; no ambiguity past midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cave is not backdrop but tool: the narrow passage she alone can access, the selenite pillar that literally hides the painting, the violet glow that times her hours-long sitting. Micro-setting objects—the broken lock, the canvas edge—constrain the moment she finally draws. Spatial choreography is clean; hands, paper, and crystals remain trackable. The selenite pillar’s hidden niche satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the final triptych image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creativity versus family curse—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when she confronts the half-finished portrait. One meaningful deepening: the lock’s shattered pieces on the floor prove prior violent suppression, raising the cost of continuing the chain. Agency is the decision to rectify by drawing; the price is forty years of silence paid in one night. Cost is legible: fingers blistered, face streaked, “tears…never wavered.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete return: locked/hidden → exposed/completed. The refrain of “echo” (laughter, corridors, generations) accumulates until the final exhaled breath recasts it as life instead of emptiness. No moralizing sentence; the last line is imagistic. Subtext lives in objects—shattered lock equals fractured lineage—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices minerals by date, tourist faces by memory, art by what is missing. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for descent (“She descended deeper…”) then staccato beats when charcoal meets paper. Violet glow, selenite, charcoal grit all return as tactile vocabulary. No head-hop; grandmother’s voice arrives only via letter and painting, never omniscient intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong density: “charcoal-fingered hands trailing along walls that glowed with the pale violet light of dawn breaking through ice” does three jobs in one clause. No模板 cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “She would… She would…” final paragraph could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure image. Mixed-metaphor check safe; crystalline imagery stays internally consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: mnemonic hyperthymesia as the very curse that makes art unbearable—perfect recall traps her in family history. The cave-gallery triptych (grandmother canvas + restored portrait + self-portrait) is an indelible final image not seen in submissions. Slight risk in lyrical repetition of “echo” and “light,” but payoff justifies choice. Could swap caves for attic and still function, so ≤8.0 cap; specificity of selenite pillar keeps it high.</comment>
