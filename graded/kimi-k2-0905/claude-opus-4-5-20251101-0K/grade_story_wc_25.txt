<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Celia’s tacit knowledge of the maze and her auditory radar are vivid, but her interiority stays utilitarian—no contradictory impulse or visible cost surfaces until she volunteers to guide. The man’s filial motive is sketched only in summary, so the relationship crucible never ignites. Closure is a soft nod, not a stance crystallized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is lean: storm → compass failure → sonic tracking → stranger → key-as-template → hidden archive. One micro-turn (key = map crease template) rewrites route and lands the pair at the father’s cache. Closure is an earned stasis: Celia accepts her role as keeper of whispered knowledge; the cost is the tacit covenant to keep hiding, felt in the final auroral hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Port-container maze is rendered through sonic geography and auroral sheen; every metal surface either deflects or channels sound, dictating tactics. The storm is not wallpaper—it scrambles compass, flickers paint, and justifies the key’s electromagnetic vulnerability. Micro-setting (folded paper, brass key) constrains the pivotal fold that reveals the final path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single stake: will Celia expose or protect the labyrinth’s hidden archive? Escalation is one gear-shift: the key-map template collapses infinite paths into a single worker-only corridor. Cost is oblique—she forfeits exclusive custodianship, but the forfeiture is understated, legible only in her whispered acceptance of the man’s gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges via motif: folded silence beats shouted declarations. Subtext lives in the hush between metallic walls and in the man’s tear-wet coin pressed to coat. Final image—storm singing overhead while containers keep secrets—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the archive’s future remains as hidden as its past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Celia’s auditory perceptions; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, whisper-calibrated; diction never exceeds dock-worker lexicon. Rhythm tightens with shorter beats during the final approach, mirroring her spontaneous yet rehearsed footfall pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—sound physics, backstory, and emotional tilt in single breaths. No loops or scaffold; metaphor is spare (“ribbons of green and violet”) and tied to aurora physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line cadence mirrors the hush it describes. Only nit: two “every” openers in paragraph 3 create a faint template echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + shipping-container maze + origami cartography. Sonic navigation as stealth GPS feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk is quiet—no violence, no chase—but the wager (silence > noise) is complete. Conceptual repricing at the end makes the storm itself a keeper of whispers, not merely backdrop.</comment>
