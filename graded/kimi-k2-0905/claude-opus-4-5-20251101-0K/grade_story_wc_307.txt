<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s reverse-aging body and Vara’s need to restore her erased village give both characters sharp, contradictory stakes; the withheld lesson turns Elowen into the living cost Vara must later reverse. Interiority stays concrete (“emotions growing rawer as his body reverses”) and the final micro-choice—Vara bowing, accepting responsibility to throw the second stone—pays off the emotional setup. Only the single-scene frame keeps relationship pressure from deepening further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elowen delays the revelation, Vara learns the interference pattern; therefore she grasps that a second wave can re-manifest her people. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—Vara sees the cost of reversal encoded in Elowen’s own vanishing youth, and the final image (“she would throw the second stone”) forecloses the path of passive studenthood. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock, magnetic grotto, and sycamore hush are not backdrop: the rock’s suspension demands the grotto’s force lines, and the pool’s rings supply the literal mechanics of vanishing. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (Elowen reads leaf patterns “only he could read”). The platform constrains the final choice—she bows on a swaying stone that could drop without the grotto’s pull—charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore erased village—tightens when Vara realizes vanishing is collision, not subtraction; the second stone must amplify, risking over-write of herself or Elowen. Escalation is single but meaningful: withheld knowledge → interference vision → acceptance of agency. Cost is legible: Elowen’s youth drain and Vara’s future burden of reversing him. No coincidence; all pressure is teacher-student causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: absence can be made present if one pays the personal price of collision. The rings reweight the empire’s decree from erasure to reversible waveform, reframing genocide as physics rather than fate. Final line offers resonant non-moral: responsibility is inherited, not taught. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elowen then Vara without head-hop; perceptual signature is specific (“sycamore hush,” “river returning to its source”). Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences for Elowen’s backward life, short imperative fragments during trance instruction. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: Vara’s “You weave truth carefully” simultaneously accuses and accepts. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and information (“rings spread outward, silver-bright under the stars, each circle carrying encoded meaning”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the trance beat, then exhales into the final bow. Opening and closing lines book-end the wave motif cleanly. Only hairline repetition of “stone” three times in closing paragraph keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: reverse-aging mentor + magnetic grotto + interference-pattern magic treats erasure as literal physics, not metaphor. Delayed-revelation pedagogy becomes lived sacrifice, avoiding the trope of wise elder who simply knows. Risk of conceptual overload is managed by grounding every abstraction in tactile detail (dropped stone, swaying platform). The premise would collapse if any named component were swapped.</comment>
