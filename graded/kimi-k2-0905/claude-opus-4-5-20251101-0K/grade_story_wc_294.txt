<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's "polished calm" as inherited armour is dramatized through micro-choices—pinning money, facing investors—so the trait drives visible action. Interior contradiction is present but stays summarized ("tremor in his bloodline") rather than enacted in-scene; the final rapprochement is credible yet leans on dialogue admission more than embodied cost. Still, the father-son crucible forces a legible status shift and renunciation inside the caboose, satisfying the 600-word threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: stacked images—circus train, foreign bills, stone markers—accrete until the final quiet re-configuration. Causality is loose (startup fails off-stage) yet pattern holds because the collapse returns Elias to territorial "ground that holds us," delivering a Charged-Poise closure with conceptual cost ("these should travel even if we don't"). Anchor deficit: "Highway 47" appears before place-time is fixed, but the deferral serves the lyrical design, so Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The caboose and its decaying fresco function as micro-setting: every vintage item Elias sells is culled from these cars, tethering commerce to refuge. Foreign bills evolve from décor to dialogue catalyst, charging the final image when father and son handle them with "unexpected reverence." Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene; wildflower-swallowed tracks economically signal abandonment without catalogue bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep running or reconcile—tightens only once, when stone markers reappear at warehouse door; that micro-turn is textural, not causal, yet it reweights escape as invitation. Cost is felt through surrendered venture and returned exile to caboose, but the startup crash is off-page, muting price immediacy under the Accumulative lens. Still, agency remains his: he elects stasis beside father, foreclosing flight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: territory as emotional gravity, circus décor as failed spectacle, money as unspent motion—no character sermonizes it. Final "beautiful impossibility" of static bills reframes earlier wanderlust into acceptance of rootedness, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in silences ("You took enough") carries more ache than explanatory dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person keeps perceptual distance befitting Elias's guarded "polished calm"; selective attention favors salvageable artifacts and currency iconography, consistent with entrepreneur hobbyist. Compressed lyric rhythm ("startup grew faster than weeds") supports accumulative pattern; no POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. Father's diction—"pilgrim before icons"—differentiates slightly; convergent calm at closure reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information ratio: single sentences fold time-jump, backstory, and metaphor ("he had taught himself a polished calm…") without scaffolding. Figurative language is spare and keeps physical logic; no synonym loops or cadence templates. Occasional elevated note ("icons," "pilgrim") fits thematic elevation without register drift; closure line is lean and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.6</question><comment>The "abandoned-circus-train refuge + foreign-currency gallery" combo feels fresh; it grounds symbolism in tactile entrepreneurship rather than sheer quirk. Father-stone-language callback that converts warning into welcome offers an earned reversal tied to specific history. Arc is still recognizably "return-to-origin after failure," limiting surprise, but particularizing details (Djibouti franc research, repurposed robber codes) lift it above template.</comment>
