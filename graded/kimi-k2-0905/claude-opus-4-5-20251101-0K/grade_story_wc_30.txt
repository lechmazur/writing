<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is atmospheric rather than embodied; “Routine is how we survive” is a thesis, not a revealed contradiction. No micro-choice in the moment of smelting shows her fork between power and fragility. The closing self-question (“Was she the same Mira…?”) is told, not dramatized, so the identity cost is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the eternal present is accepted with conceptual cost (“today held infinite space for wonder”). However, the causal chain is thin—no concrete beat shows smelting altering her next action; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern is legible, but no persistent price (tool damage, social credit, energy drain) shapes the final image. Orientation is clear by line 5; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vivid and tactile—water creeps over her titan-gear feet, moonlight calibrates hydraulic hum. Environment constrains choice only implicitly; a stronger link would have shown the rising tide threatening the smelting process or shelving units. Still, the salt-water library is memorable and specific enough for 8-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder in a tomorrow-less world—is declared early. Pressure is ambient, not tightening; the fisherman’s arrival restates the problem without new risk. No visible resource lost, deadline advanced, or option foreclosed; escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than causal narrowing. Acceptable under Accumulative lens but lacks a felt trade-off to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-watercolor emerges organically from smelting contradictions and migrating photographs. Final line reweights the premise: persistence of memory is enough even without future. Avoids explicit moral; only minor deduction for the aphoristic “Routine is how we survive.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vocabulary stays within Mira’s professional-archive register; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices shelving units, salt stains, moon-phase torque. Rhythm breathes with tidal sentences; no head-hop. Dialogue is brief but differentiated: fisherman’s creel/weathered syntax vs. Mira’s archival diction. Clean free indirect style.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, figurative but not purple; density is high. Minor loop: “tidal atrium’s waters began their afternoon rise… she adjusted her stance with the unconscious grace of long practice” repeats the tide-adjustment idea within four lines. No metaphor clash; closing image is crisp. Gate for 9+ fails because the loop touches the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Submerged salt-water archive after time-collapse is a fresh synthesis; migrating identities as literal scrambled photographs is inventive. Conceptual commitment is full—no retreat to linear time. Risk is moderate, coherence high; not quite a 9 because the emotional calculus leans familiar (find beauty in ruins).</comment>
