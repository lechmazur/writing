<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meridia’s interiority is precise—“she had never imagined herself a ruler”—and her micro-choice to climb anyway crystallizes her contradiction. The embodied cost is legible: sixty-four-year-old knees on phantom stairs, ruby flake dissolving into her skin. No stock phrases; every thought is filtered through a cataloguer’s trained attention to pigment and circuitry. The final renunciation of power for story-keeping lands as earned stasis because her earlier caution foreshadows it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: each peeled mural is a because/therefore trigger that narrows the path toward the tree. Closure is a Decisive Change—she steps onto the first immaterial stair—paid for by the dissolved heirloom and the dawn-clock. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation inside the kaleidoscopic waterfall is taught early and pays off when the tree turns translucent. Lens purity intact: every image reconfigures options under Causal drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline path, prismatic spray, gnarled circuitry-wrapped trunks—details are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. The “scattered data-point droplets” reappear as the final image of light on the throne, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean: orchard rows, mural sequence, stair that materialises underfoot. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the ruby flake itself becomes the environment that admits her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legitimacy versus lore-keeping—tightens when the flake warms and the bark turns translucent, foreclosing retreat. Sunrise clock is visible price: “dawn approached…first rays would seal the passage.” Escalation is causal, not violent: each mural reduces wrong turns until only the central tree remains. Cost is legible—ruby dissolves, body ages, identity forfeits ruler fantasy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of power and memory: the keeper who claims the throne only to refuse it for story-keeping. No moralizing; the final image of her climbing while declaring herself “always a keeper” reweights the premise. Subtext in the peeling paint: dynasties erased by their own camouflage. The conceptual repricing—legitimacy is narrative, not crown—lands with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Meridia’s perceptual signature—cataloguer’s diction, circuitry metaphors, color-precision. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure: “She climbed as the sky brightened.” Rhythm accelerates across paratactic clauses mirroring ascending stairs. Filter verbs absent; sensory verbs are strong: “coated,” “fractured,” “shimmered.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence slips mural reveal, emperor pointer, and spatial directive. Sentence variety mirrors emotional arc—long latency clauses in orchard calm, staccato prepositional phrases on the stair. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, creating cadence symmetry. Micro-movements serve purpose: “pressed the ruby flake” is the precise tactile beat that triggers translucence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Futuristic succession-orchard with memory-fruit is fresh, yet rooted in recognisable mythic ascent. The paint-peel mechanic reverses the usual hidden-door trope by making history itself the palimpsest. Risk: immaterial stairway could feel abstract, but circuitry bark and ruby resonance ground it. Synthesis feels inevitable: lore-keeper becomes rightful heir precisely because she preserved, not coveted, power.</comment>
