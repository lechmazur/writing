<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is concrete—her four-decade vocation, the bark-like patches she hides, the silent breakfast strikes—and the metamorphosis is embodied rather than diagnosed. The single contradiction (“I must control / I must surrender”) drives her final stance, so the arc is earned. Micro-choices (pressing the leaf to her chest, baring her feet to moss) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Voice specificity slips only once with “greenish tint” cliché, but overall she feels lived-in and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved linden leaf plus rain-washed boundaries reweight her humanity and charge the closing image with undeniable cost. Orientation is clean by 50 words; causal lens holds: because the leaf appears / therefore she confronts the change → because she surrenders / therefore the leaf dissolves. No prop teleporting; reflection (dream-veins) is anchored to present stimuli and pays off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains her stance—wood once alive, now leaning toward her—mirrors her transition. Rain timing is causal: pauses let her reach the trellis; its return forces the final surrender. Sensory hierarchy plant-biased (“slow, meditative drip” she can read). Spatial choreography clear: kitchen→path→trellis, distances held. Final image of roots testing soil is tactile, not symbol-stated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve human self vs. allow plant becoming—signals early and tightens when the linden leaf matches her dream-veins, making surrender unavoidable. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory shift (no hunger, spine-pull, green veins) deepens cost until stance crystallization. Micro-turn: denial → surrender. Physical price visible: hair silkens, feet root. Coincidence only complicates (leaf placement); resolution comes via her agency to release control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: transformation demands surrender; knowledge without acceptance is futile. Linden leaf and dream-vein motif recur with reweighted meaning: messenger → invitation → dissolution, charging closure. Subtext in gesture: standing barefoot in rain = silent yes to becoming. No moralizing; complexity preserved—she’ll still sell geraniums tomorrow. Emotional aftereffect lingers as uncanny recognition of our own unspoken metamorphoses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Free-indirect style stays close to Vera: “her weathered hands,” “inexplicably satisfied,” diction plant-biased (“silk from milkweed pods”). Rhythm lengthens during reflection, fragments under shock (“Green threading through her veins”). Filter verbs minimal; perception selective—she catalogues moisture, not brands. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests in interior syntax, which passes read-aloud ear test without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines multitask: “moss had claimed every surface” sets scene + agency metaphor + time passage. Metaphors stay botanical, coherent. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Only micro-slip: “purple and inevitable” leans purple-prose but fits storm palette and is forgiven at closure distance. Opening and closing lines anchor and release pressure cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Plant-centric body-horror is familiar turf, yet approach is fresh: botanical scientist who has literally studied transformation confronts its cost inside her skin. Dream-vein → real vein synthesis makes the fantastical feel inevitable. Risk: lyric surrender ending could drift sentimental, but rain-dissolved leaf avoids tidy symbolism by staying physical. Specific horticultural details (milkweed silk, seedling music) individuate voice beyond stock eco-fantasy.</comment>
