<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is luminous: “She existed now in the space between the drop and the ripple” crystallizes her disorientation as lived sensation. Contradictory impulses—yearning for unity yet perpetually generating new selves—are dramatized in her decision to release the tablet, a micro-choice that costs her the fantasy of singularity. The arc lands in earned stasis: she accepts endless fragmentation, a renunciation felt in the final image of her rising again. No safety-hedging; flaws (compulsion to fragment) drive the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tablet’s release and her upward flight reweight the premise—no center, no escape, only perpetual self-creation. The causal chain holds: each procedural rune-shift she witnesses tightens the paradox until acceptance becomes the only on-page option. Cost is palpable: “for the first time, she felt not fragmented but whole” is legible only because she abandons the quest for unity. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and intact at the final image of spiraling timelines.</comment>

<comment>The viaduct’s phosphorescent algae and rain-slick stones are not backdrop but causal texture: their bright-dark paradox mirrors and constrains her perception of self. Micro-setting—tablet in palms, wet stone against soles—grounds orientation within 50 words. The final ascent is charged by the glowing arch beneath, making environment inseparable from the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean: suspended → descent → rise again tracks without drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—end self-fragmentation—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each rune reconfiguration deepens the impossibility of singular identity, tightening until acceptance is the only remaining option. Cost is conceptual but visible: she abandons the tablet, relinquishing the illusion of control. No coincidence; pressure coils through accumulative paradox rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: identity as perpetual self-authorship rather than fixed unity. The “darkening brightness” paradox migrates from visual texture to metaphysical stance without overt statement. Final image—her flying into the next configuration—offers a non-literal answer: wholeness is embracing fragmentation. No moralizing; resonance arises from the tablet’s last mute configuration and her lifted foot.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-philosophical yet sensorily grounded: “rain-slicked stones reflected the strange luminescence” keeps abstraction tethered to touch. Rhythm swells and contracts with altitude—long, suspended sentences while airborne; shorter, weightier phrases on stone. No head-hopping; POV stays interior-third locked to Mira. Elision (“time no longer moved in straight lines”) is taught early and paid off in the final helical image.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The labyrinth was not something she moved through. It was something she perpetually constructed” advances both concept and stakes. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors—though density is high, it pattern-pays at closure. No loops or scaffold; each clause adds new angle on self-creation. Near-zero filter verbs; perception is direct.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: procedural-generation trope is interiorized as lived identity crisis rather than tech gimmick. “Periodically eternal” is re-conceptualized as psychological condition, not cosmic label. Risk-taking—lyric nonlinear mosaic—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Transformation complete: removing tablet/viaduct/timelines collapses the entire emotional logic.</comment>
