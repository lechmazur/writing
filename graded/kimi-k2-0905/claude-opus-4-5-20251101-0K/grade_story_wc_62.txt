<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—her wish to honor each Hendricks individually vs. the spectral mentor’s demand that she feel their connected absence—are dramatized in concrete sketching and ribbon-tying beats. Interiority is particular (monarch wing-beat as metronome, poem titles as family shorthand). The final micro-choice—adding black ribbon to the braid—costs her the comfort of individual tribute and is legible on-page. Slight over-articulation of grief theory keeps this from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dusk visit layers sensory and emotional density until the final sketch reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—constellation sketch + ribbon tie—that makes collective grief visible without tidy resolution; cost is the forfeiture of solo names. One transition (greenhouse → home) is legible; pattern of dusk returns taught early. External causality is loose but permissible under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Iron-and-glass greenhouse, monarch flight paths, and ribbon textures constrain Elara’s movements and literally guide the final design. Dying light, glass gaps, and cold spot anchor every beat; body-as-micro-setting (monarch on shoulder) charges the closing image. Selective sensory economy—never more than two senses per beat—keps momentum. Environment shapes tactics: broken panes admit butterflies that become the pattern she carves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a form that holds collective grief—tightens when spectral mentor rejects individual-name concept, forcing Elara to re-sketch. Escalation is accretive: each dusk adds a color to the ribbon braid, narrowing options toward the constellation form. Visible cost: surrender of separate headstones implied by final ribbon addition. Slight abstraction of “shape of collective grief” keeps pressure from feeling viscerally sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shifting ribbon colors and constellation metaphor: grief is not subtraction but reconfigured connection. Subtext lives in silence between mentor and student, in the unspoken fear that individual names will be forgotten. Final image of “space enough for everyone to stand together” reweights earlier dread of erasure without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis by letting stone sketch and ribbon act as the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Elara’s perceptual filter: glass catches light “like tears frozen mid-fall,” poems arrive as family shorthand, not exposition. Rhythmic control: long sentences for meditative dusk, clipped fragments when she ties ribbon. No head-hopping; ghost’s dialogue is filtered through her cold-shoulder sensation. Diction stays within rural artisan lexicon; “constellation,” “architecture of absence” feel earned as carved metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence slips in greenhouse age, monarch migration timing, and family craft lineage. Metaphors are coherent—glass/tears, flight paths/roots—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “like rivers, like flight patterns, like the roots” could compress, but it lands at emotional crest and is forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive every clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost mentor + butterfly migration + funerary textile art feels idiosyncratic yet inevitable. Risk of sentimental “collective grief” trope is undercut by refusal to list names and by cold spectral presence. Ribbon roll as portable archive of county loss is concrete world-building at micro-scale. Premise is familiar (ghost teacher) but retooled through stone-carving craft and monarch pattern language.</comment>
