<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-riven exile and need for self-absolution are concrete and embodied; the knight-chess-piece fidget anchors every beat. Interior contradiction—pride in his craft versus horror at its outcome—stays active in scene. The final letting-go is credibly prepared: the mirrored labyrinth literally reflects his culpability, so the drop of the knight into it externalizes the knot he releases. Micro-choices—thread-counting, eye-tracing the maze—show productive restlessness without therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the knight’s absorption into the platinum rewrites the rule-set—“guilt was a labyrinth with no exit until one stops walking.” Cost is visible in the moment flour dust finally moves. Causal lens dominates: because he decodes the tapestry, therefore he can cede the knight and accept stasis. Orientation is secure by line 4; no prop or knowledge teleporting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen tableau supplies an immediate, tactile micro-setting: suspended flour grains, half-turned rope swing—details noticed by a man who parses stillness for a living. The platinum labyrinth’s mirror at center becomes the decisive environmental pivot that forces self-confrontation. Thunder lull functions as lived weather, never decorative. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Marcus kneels, threads, rises, walks away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Marcus relinquish guilt—tightens once: the decoded path demands he offer up the knight. Agency is interior but visible: thread-by-thread decoding is the active tactic. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative/textural: suspended time accumulates pressure until mirror confronts him with irretrievable cost. Price—ceding the knight and accepting that the village resumes living—lands on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular fibres: teaching sharpens minds, not morals; responsibility ends at the lesson, not the pupil’s later blade. Subtext in the silence of frozen breath critiques the price of endless safety. Final image—flour drifting again—reconfigures the moral weight without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: village chose stasis, Marcus chooses motion; both carry cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited sticks to Marcus’s sensory sieve: flour clouds, maze ridges felt by eye, metallic taste of remorse. Syntax lengthens during decoding, shortens at release, mirroring breath. No POV leakage; village voices remain frozen externals. Distinct perceptual signature—thread twist direction as data—keeps voice individuality under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare, rhythmic, high-density: “woven hush” carries three jobs (acoustic, tactile, moral). No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (labyrinth = guilt). One near-miss: “productive in their restlessness” edges toward abstraction but is saved by immediate tactile threading that follows. Read-aloud cadence peaks at knight-drop, then exhales cleanly.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village + exiled tutor + tapestry cryptography fuses into a fresh angle on the “mentor’s guilt” trope. Platinum labyrinth as mirror-catalyst re-weights the familiar chess-as-war metaphor. Specificity—knight piece, thread twist, flour motes—grounds the concept so it could not swap settings intact. Risk in quiet ending earns +0.3: no battle, only cession, yet stakes feel absolute.</comment>
