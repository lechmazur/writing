<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—fob crescents in skin, “comforting unease”—and the father-haunted motive stays taut. Yet the final pivot from moonshine heir to “keeper of silence” is asserted rather than dramatized; we see no moment where she actively renounces the runner life. The emotional cost is present but not compounded by an interior contradiction in-scene. Still, the embodied grief and micro-choices under pressure keep her credibly steadfast.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: because father died → truce fragile → must stop recording → intercepts courier → seizes cylinder → drowns it. The sunrise deadline is stated early and honored; spatial choreography across the market is clean. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses the war path by destroying the sound—but the cost is more asserted (“heavy in her pocket”) than felt in a crystallized image. Orientation is secured by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The pirate market is rendered through sinewy, selective detail—lanterns like “captured stars,” eel-tank reflection used for surveillance—so setting actively constrains tactics. Rotting pier, salt-thick darkness, and vendor layout track spatially across the intercept beat. The watch fob acts as micro-setting: its frozen 3:47 and “CONSTANT” anchor paternal memory and final decision. Weather is absent, but market’s geography and reflective surfaces directly enable the theft.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prevent sonic betrayal that would shatter the “truce of hush”—is signaled in para 3 and tightened when the cylinder drops into her hand. Sunrise clock supplies external pressure; the two prior failed attempts show escalation of risk. The final narrowing is her choice to shoulder perpetual guardianship rather than sell or trade the sound, but the price (future burden of silence) is implied more than dramatized. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<comment>Theme coheres around inherited silence as survival: moonshine legacy transmuted into guarding quiet. The fob’s “CONSTANT” and frozen time quietly rewire to mean enduring silence, not defiant speed. Subtext lives in gesture—clutching broken watch, letting cylinder sink—avoiding overt thesis. Final paragraph’s “comforting unease” is too on-the-nose thematizing (−0.3), yet the image of dawn over drowned sound sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Eliza with vivid perceptual signature—brass crescents, salt taste, lantern reflections in eel glass. Diction (“salt-thick darkness,” “acoustic amber”) is lyrical yet controlled, compressing under tempo of pursuit. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from reflective backstory to immediate sensorium during intercept. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to staccato movements (“She moved too—not toward him…”). Clean, conventional dialogue mechanics when used.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: every sentence advances image, stake, or beat. Metaphors are fresh but coherent—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold detected: “narrow passages between vendor stalls” followed immediately by “narrow passages” again; minor. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“breathed,” “swung,” “slipped”) dominate. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reverb motif without overwriting. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<comment>Familiar noir-pirate smugglers refreshed by sonic betrayal MacGuffin and inherited-silence twist. “Truce of hush” and bottled betrayal frequency give conceptual bite. Risk-taking is moderate—market, magic sound—but execution is precise, not gimmick. Detail specificity (antique fob frozen at death hour, eel-tank mirror) prevents generic overlay. Fresh inflection: moonshine legacy re-cast as guardian of quiet; removal would collapse emotional engine.</comment>
