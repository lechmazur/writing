<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“trembling with exhaustion and wonder,” the vine tightening around her wrist—showing contradictory fear/duty without label-speak. The final renunciation of perfect success (“single morning could not undo decades”) is earned and costly. The “whimsical tinkerer” tag is stated more than dramatized; only one micro-choice (the cracked singing) is invention-adjacent. Net result: strong, but not quite the 9-band because the vocational trait never complicates or forecloses a live option.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vine pulses green, Mira accepts incremental cost, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of song/light reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no causal breaks. The persistent constraint (“next harvest, she would bring others”) is legible in the final image. The -0.4 gap to 9.0 owes to modest escalation: one intensification rather than a tightening sequence that forecloses a second path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (the arbor lattice, stone altar, single tendril) constrains every move and literally charges the final image when the tendril releases. Sensory selection skews to tactile/rust/rot under crisis, then color-return as relief. Spatial choreography is flawless—moon west / sun east alignment tracked beat-by-beat. World rules stay consistent; no occupational depth required.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restore sacred practices or vines die”—is signaled early and deepened when the last healthy tendril clings to her wrist. One meaningful tightening: the song must be human, not machine, forcing her public vulnerability. Cost is visible: voice break, tears, acknowledged partial failure. Escalation is single-stage; lacks a second reversal or resource loss, so holds at 8.0 rather than 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (memory/land reciprocity) emerges through song-to-plant material loop, never sermonized. Final image of “golden morning light” reweights the opening “pale ghost” moon without moral statement. Subtext sits in gesture—tendril as plaintiff, device as failed translator. Slight abstraction in “stories the plants understood” keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—mechanics jargon, color-return synesthesia, fear of her own voice. Rhythm swells with clause-length cadence that mirrors spinning phonograph gears, then fractures at climax (“Her voice cracked”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under pressure. Register never exceeds her plausible lexicon. Meets 9- gate on texture but lacks the final hairline risk to punch 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and carries metaphor (“pink light caught in copper bells”). Zero scaffold/loop; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language disappears in the climax, letting action breathe. Opening and closing sentences perform sonic book-end without felt contrivance. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-restoration via mechanical music-box plus human breath; not a trope template. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural experiment—so no bonus. Tendril-as-plaintiff and “spinning golden stories” literalized into sound-to-chlorophyll feel particular and inevitable. Would lose spine if stripped to generic “inventor saves orchard.”</comment>
