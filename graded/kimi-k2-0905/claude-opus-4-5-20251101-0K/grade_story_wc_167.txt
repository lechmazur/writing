<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is concrete—cuts on her hands, the stone’s weight, the fisherman’s laugh—but the moment of “renunciation” is pure conceptual assertion (“moments… could not be demolished”). No embodied cost is staged; the decision to scatter new glass is announced, not dramatized with contradiction or price. The micro-choice of throwing the stone is evocative yet changes nothing in her tactics; the final sketch is consequence-free. Character therefore hovers in strong observational territory without the felt friction that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the atrium’s slow refractions, the widening ripples, and the shifting mist layer density until the council’s demolition date becomes conceptually re-priced as irrelevant. Closure earns Charged Poise: Elena’s realization that “value was not fixed in objects but in the attention we bring” reweights the stake on the page, and the image of colored fingers gilding the boat makes the cost legible without exposition. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5, well inside the 120-word window.</comment>

<comment>The prism atrium functions as both setting and evolving object; its light-beams physically constrain where Elena stands and later paint the passing boat, charging the final image. Pearl Bay’s dawn mist, salt-rotted pier, and “noctilucent” sky are filtered through glazier perception—every surface is judged for refractive potential. Spatial choreography is clean: stone → ripples → pilings → atrium → boat, all tracked without drift. Environment never feels like backdrop; it supplies the very materials of Elena’s impending, smaller-scale rebuilding.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the atrium from erasure—is signaled in para 4. Escalation is textural: mist thinning, colors sharpening, council deadline tightening the emotional aperture rather than narrowing tactical options. The meaningful turn is conceptual: demolition stops mattering when Elena reframes value from permanence to disseminated attention; the price is the loss of her seventeen-year monument, but that cost is asserted, not dramatized in a beat that hurts. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a visible trade-off or resource lost keeps it below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—“beauty exists everywhere, waiting to be noticed”—emerges through glass shards, interference ripples, and the fisherman’s momentary gilding, never sermonized. The grandmother’s superstition about noctilucent clouds is recalled, then folded into Elena’s scientific mysticism, creating layered counter-readings. Final image of colored light on a stranger’s face reweights the demolition from loss to diffusion, achieving resonance without moral. Only the single sentence “She had learned long ago…” flirts with overt thesis, but it is immediately grounded in tactile stone-throwing, limiting the debit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elena’s glazier eye: light is “fractured,” fog is “painted,” beams are “fingers of some vast and careful hand.” Syntax lengthens and softens with mist, then contracts to clipped sketching motions at the end, mirroring the shift from expansive contemplation to decisive action. No dialogue appears; absence is harmless. Free-indirect diction (“her folly… her conversation”) remains in character, never drifts into editorial. Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive enough to reach the 9-band edge; only the single abstract phrase “noctilucent reckonings” feels slightly writerly rather than Elena’s own idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense: one sentence delivers glass origin, pier decay, and dawn timing without slack. Metaphors are tactile—light “streams,” ripples “intersect” pilings—avoiding mixed vehicles. No loops or paraphrase stacks; each sentence advances image or stance. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“noctilucent,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above the glazier’s likely lexicon, warranting a small deduction but never obscuring causality or dulling the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “artist versus redevelopment” arc is familiar, but the glazier-glass-window language refracted through physics-of-light specifics feels fresh. Salvaging lenses from lighthouses and shipwrecks turns generic gentrification stakes into a maritime palimpsest; the fisherman’s accidental gilding is a precise, non-portable image. Conceptual twist—demolition as liberation into scattered mini-atriums—reverses expectation without late-rule invention. Risk is moderate, execution specific; not earth-shattering originality, yet well above template recycling.</comment>
