<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“tears freezing on her cheeks in the warm coldness”), micro-choices (kneeling, chiselling) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost. The retrocognitive curse is more reported than dramatized in-scene, a minor flat spot, but the steel arms juxtapose tenderness and violence convincingly. Earned Stasis lands with felt price: she walks away leaving the name—and her own safety—behind. Motives remain consistent and deepen under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the renamed stone reweights history itself, social cost unmistakable. Causal chain holds—every vision is triggered by concrete touch, each carving stroke pays forward the soldier’s mercy. Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via repeating object-memory pattern; final image crystallizes options under fractured sky with persistent constraint (regime still rules, stone now waits). No orientation debt, no lens ambiguity; cost legible in the final sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Fractured dome of ash and amber,” “warm coldness,” and the cobalt-gold tessera constitute a micro-setting that constrains every retrocognitive dive. The shattered sky is not backdrop but tactical hazard—light filters wrong, time feels warped. Spatial choreography clean: plaza, fountain rubble, stepping-stone positions track across beats. Environment charges the final image; without the ash-amber glow the name would not glow in reader memory. One hairline slip: “ancient stones” skimmed twice in opening paragraph, but density recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can tenderness survive annihilation?—signalled in paragraph one and tightened when she decides to carve rather than hide. Aberrant mercy becomes a visible tactic: she risks execution to inscribe Emre Kayan, narrowing her own options. Cost is dramatized—tears freeze, arms ache, she slips back into ruins—fulfilling the 8.8+ gate. One beat short of 9+: we do not see regime patrols or time-pressure literally close in, so price feels conceptual more than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as moral duty, tenderness as insurgency. Subtext operates in silence—no soldier speaks, yet regime horror is felt in every tessera. Final image reweights “arms of steel” from prosthetic to cradle; stone becomes quiet archive defeating erasure. Resists tidy moral—regime still rules, future pilgrims only hypothetical—keeping ambiguity honest. No echoic platitudes, no final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through retrocognitive bias (“the world dissolved”). Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during vision dumps, longer cadence for carving. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within Kira’s plausible lexicon; “tessera,” “retrocognitive,” “aberrant mercy” are concept-terms she would own. One near-filter stack: “she felt his pride, his exhaustion, his quiet hope” could compress, but rhythm serves the beat and does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors (“sky into a fractured dome”) extend world logic without self-contradiction. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line lands with propulsive ellipsis, recharging “warm light…cold absence.” Micro-scaffold: “the stone remained” repeats concept already implicit, but occurs early and does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of retrocognition + insurgent memorial is fresh; regime erasure vs. stepping-stone archive feels inevitable in hindsight. Trope transformation: prosthetic arms become tender cradle, not weapon—subverting cyber-typology. Specificity anchors universals—“cobalt and gold tessera” could exist only here. Risk of lyric mosaic structure paid off: four shards (plaza arrival, tessera vision, stepping-stone deep dive, carving departure) taught by 25% and coherence holds. No derivative premise residue; synthesis is non-obvious yet emotionally lucid.</comment>
