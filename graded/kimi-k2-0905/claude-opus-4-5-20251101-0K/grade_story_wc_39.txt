<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is textured—“the familiar ache of beauty too large for his chest”—and the final whispered name shows renunciation with cost. Yet Marcus’s contradictions stay mostly retrospective; the present-scene micro-choices (uncorking the jar, shouldering his coat) are thin compared to the reflective blocks, so the shift to action at the end feels slightly under-cooked rather than fully earned.</comment>

<comment>Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus returns Samuel to the wind, re-weighting the stake from possession to release. Causality is intact across the two shards (loft → beach walk) and orientation anchors arrive by line 5; the only mild slippage is the off-stage grandson promise acting as initial catalyst without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes, the salt-rotted kelp air, and the glass-jar walls constrain every beat: Marcus can’t stand upright, must handle each jar, and the hidden music box is kept safe by the collapsed pier timbers. These micro-setting objects charge the final image directly—the three notes dissolve into the same salt wind that sculpts his shelter—satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes are signaled early—translate the dead or stay exiled—and tighten when Marcus decides to uncork and release the captured sounds, forfeiting his archive for communal return. The escalation is one deepening rather than reversal, adequate for Accumulative design, but the cost (loss of jars’ contents) is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as portable burden vs. gift. Subtext lives in gesture—corking/uncorking jars, the whispered name on wind—avoiding moral statement. The final image re-prices the premise that redemption is something to be “gleaned,” not owned, giving resonance without tidy takeaway; slight softness comes from thematic echo approaching the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains perceptual signature—“sand cascading from his threadbare coat,” “thin cry of wind threading”—with rhythmic, salt-stained diction. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet internal cadence modulates from languid reflection to the clipped release: “He whispered the name Samuel to the wind.” Compression is taught early and holds; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: high information density, strong verbs (“wore the driftwood smooth as bone”), and metaphor clusters that stay coherent. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“salt and rotting kelp, but also something sweeter”) and a couple of near-simultaneous participle openers, yet these never obstruct causality or dull the closure image; they keep the piece just outside flawless territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Capturing sounds in mason jars is a fresh magical device that feels folk-authentic; linking three musical notes to maritime code name “Samuel” supplies an inventive payoff. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist, and the synthesis of vagrant poet + sound archivist + dune hermit feels organic, not combinatorial. Only the grandson’s off-stage presence feels like a borrowed bone, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
