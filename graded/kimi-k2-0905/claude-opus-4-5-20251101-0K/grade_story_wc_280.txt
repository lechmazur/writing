<comment>Madeline’s contradictory impulses—her craving for applause versus her acceptance of eternal service—surface only in summary; the orchard echoes do the acting for her. The woman’s indigo despair is vividly embodied, but her final shift is reported, not dramatized through micro-choice. Because the ghost’s own renunciation (“this… was close enough”) is implied rather than shown with cost, the arc approaches but does not fully clear the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fractured-timeline device is taught early and pays off in a clear Conceptual Repricing: the orchard becomes a looping stage where every sorrow can be rewound into hope. Closure lands when Madeline accepts perpetual performance as her cost, crystallized in the final sentence “But this… was close enough,” a Charged Poise that reframes centuries of repetition as chosen service. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo tightens the emotional stakes until the present woman’s posture shift reweights the ghost’s own eternal script.</comment>

<comment>The maze-after-hours orchard is evoked through synesthetic crimson applause and indigo despair, grounding orientation within 50 words. The apple tree, tarot coin, and shifting light function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the tree anchors the echoes, the coin re-orients the woman’s gaze, the dusk light allows the ghost to manifest. Spatial choreography is clean; the woman’s exit path is tracked audibly by the green-silver rhythm of her footsteps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through pattern-break: successive historical shards pile nostalgic weight until the woman’s indigo pool visually lightens. Agency is shared—the ghost curates echoes, the woman chooses to stand—creating a mutual escalation that forecloses the woman’s suicide option and reframes Madeline’s eternity. Cost is felt but abstract; a visible sacrifice (a lock of hair, a dropped coin) would have sharpened the stake into 9-band territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: performance as reciprocal rescue—audience and actor swap roles across centuries. The final image of ghostly applause substitutes for living ovation, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights art’s purpose from fame to service. Subtext resides in silence: the woman never speaks, yet her straightening spine is the standing ovation Madeline craves. No moral is declared; meaning lingers in the pale-green cadence of departing footsteps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic ghost-voice paints applause as crimson swells, despair as indigo pools—perceptual signature that never slips into generic color symbolism. Rhythm modulates: long breath-sentence of twilight settling, then staccato shard-cuts of historical dialogue. No dialogue from the living woman, a deliberate absence that turns the coin’s glint into her only spoken line. Register remains consistent: 18th-century diction in echoes stays lightly antique without pastiche.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (crimson applause never clashes with indigo despair). Minor register lift in “crystallized final moment” feels earned by ghost’s theatrical idiom. Final line achieves charged cadence without syntactic fuss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-as-stage-manager of her own afterlife auditions, using broken time as spotlight. The tarot coin’s crossroads motif is recast from fortune-telling prop to portable stage light. Risk of sentimentality is averted by refusing living-audience reunion; instead, art’s value is repriced as anonymous service. Specificity of synesthetic hues and 300-year incremental echoes prevents template drift.</comment>
