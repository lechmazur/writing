<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The oracle’s quiet obsession is credibly rooted in her tidal vocation and steadily embodied through her bloody ascent and patient map-making. Interior contradiction is thin—she never wavers or questions the quest—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-like. Still, her bleeding fingers and final smile sell the cost, earning a credible endurance that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each extinguished star thickens the texture of night until the booklet reconstitutes its gold into a navigable void. The “second-to-last star” beat delivers the required tightening; the map’s glowing lines provide visible cost and Charged Poise. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is lyrical but coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fort’s broken stones, screaming wind, and flaking gold micro-setting constrain every move—she must climb barefoot, shelter in ruins, and let metallic dust seed the map. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: salt-tanged gales over visual panorama. The final glow of the booklet against absolute dark charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—chart the void before it swallows everything—tightens with each vanished star. The second-to-last star flicker is the visible escalation that forecloses delay; the map’s creation is the irreversible act that pays the price. Cost is literal in blood-gold ink and conceptual in the burden of lone knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge as navigation-tool versus knowledge as burden. The dying star’s “retelling” reweights silence from emptiness to cartography, offering a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing—just the final smile in darkness—keeps ambiguity alive. The map’s faint after-glow embodies the cost of wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to oracle perception; diction (“pebble-shore,” “ambered hush”) is tidal, patient, mineral. Rhythm swells and ebbs with star-loss, tightening into staccato gold-lines. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression is taught early (“tiny metallic fragments”) and paid off in the glowing map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with escalating darkness; sentence length shortens as stars thin. No loops or synonym churn; “flaking gold” recurs with accruing agency, not decoration. Metaphors stay physical (“honey-thickened time”) and coherent. One clause (“She had come because the darkness was spreading”) is strategic tell that accelerates ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar apocalyptic-darkness trope is retooled through tide-stone divination and cartographic silence, making the oracle’s craft inseparable from cosmic stakes. Risk—mapping literal night—pays off conceptually without gimmickry. Specificity of gold dust as ink feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection: silence not as absence but as topography.</comment>
