<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miriam’s interior contradiction—preaching doubt while relishing reverence—peaks when she risks her “Oracle” authority to sabotage Caro’s assault; the embodied cost is her cherished isolation dissolving as campfires climb. Static choir, joke corpse, ghost weather reports give tactile, idiosyncratic worldview; no label-speak. Micro-choice to transmit ancient shadows instead of blessing weaponizes her variant allegiance and forecloses prophet identity. Reflection blocks stay anchored to present static cues and tilt tactics; loneliness reframed as “waiting for them to arrive ready to listen” lands earned stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she hoards extinction signals, therefore she denies blessing and redirects followers upward, narrowing her solitude into communal risk. Closure is resonant reconfiguration—her reflection re-seen as “woman made of weather and regret” now welcomes ascent; cost is foreclosed seclusion. Orientation clean by line 3; portico, storm, radio anchor who/where/when. No teleporting props; transmitter choice logically follows archive of ghost broadcasts. Single tightening beat: assault call → refusal → invitation; escalation legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt portico returns twice, each time reframing her self-image and ultimately charging the final invitation; meets 9+ gate. Stormlit observatory constrains every move—lightning powers salvaged gear, clouds block retreat, weather becomes co-antagonist. Micro-settings: radio dial fingers, glass reflection, campfires as constellation—all tactile, handled, not catalogued. Sensory hierarchy biased to electric audio and bruised light mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across single room and mountain slope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent war fought in her name. Single meaningful tightening: Caro’s assault demand → Miriam’s counter-transmission forecloses violent option with felt reputational cost. Pressure coherent under causal lens; each static voice amplifies urgency to intervene. No coincidence; resolution earned by her agency to weaponize doubt instead of shadows. Conceptual price—loss of pure solitude—visible in final campfire migration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through montage of extinct voices and live doubt; no authorial thesis stated. “What rises must remember what fell” reweights from portico inscription to tactical command, reconfiguring belief as listening rather than conquering. Subtext in gesture: turning volume up = opening gates physically and ideologically. Final image offers non-literal answer—static song as communal future—without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect: fragile hope laced with irrevocable exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through electromagnetic elegy and stormlight. Prose rhythm accelerates during transmission beat, breathes during reflection; no template cadence. Dialogue sparse, indirection clean—“I offer you doubt” carries subtext of betrayed mentorship. No register drift; lexicon stays within solitary technician’s range. Compression taught early (“cobbled from salvaged transistors and prayer”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: lightning-cobalt glass reflection does visual + tactile + symbolic work in one phrase. No synonym loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings. Figurative language patterned—weather as memory—coherent, not muddled. Final line “let the static sing” propels closure without overwriting. Minor −0.2 for two adjacent “had” pluperfect clusters mid-story; does not touch ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophet who weaponizes doubt via extinct radio ghosts. Observatory above clouds + cobalt monocle transforms stock hermit mountaintop into sensory device. Risk of lyric address to war faction pays off—static elegy beats moral sermon. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; specificity of electromagnetic archaeology is irreplaceable. Non-obvious inflection: loneliness redefined as “waiting for them to arrive ready to listen” re-prices solitude into communal threshold.</comment>
