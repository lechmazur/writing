<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet-registrar past is shown through ritual return, lens habit, and eavesdrop skill; the gift of the lens externalizes her shift from observer to participant. Theo’s guilt and need to “translate” without words are embodied in the obsessive ticket-drawing; accepting the lens registers his acceptance of being seen. Both characters act under contradictory impulses—withdrawal vs. connection—until the mutual exchange crystallizes a new relational state at visible cost (she surrenders distance, he surrenders anonymity). Micro-choice hierarchy is legible; no stock interiority; change is proportionate to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, orientation locked by line 4; causal lens holds: because language died, Mira clings to ritual; because she observes Theo, they exchange objects; therefore their stances reconfigure. Closure is Earned Stasis: the lens transfer forecloses Mira’s protective distance and Theo’s isolation, cost felt in the crystalline echo that “spread the moment.” No teleporting props; every object (lens, ticket, pen) is introduced, handled, and transformed on stage. Persistent constraint—wordless world—shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: rain-slick facets amplify footfalls into music, guiding Mira’s eavesdrop; the bench and spire provide coherent spatial anchors for the exchange. Lens and tickets act as portable setting-extensions that constrain choices—she sees through it, he draws on them, both are re-handled at climax. Sensory selection stays inside POV bias (registrar’s ear for echo, archivist’s eye for refracted light). Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: need for human recognition in a post-linguistic world, signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens once Mira steps from shadow to bench—she risks her practiced solitude; the exchange of artifacts narrows options, making mutual visibility irreversible. Cost is the surrender of protective distance (lens) and public anonymity (tickets). No antagonist required; internal/external conflicts merge around mistrust. Escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth as embodied gesture rather than utterance—emerges through the ticket drawings and lens swap; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in silence, object exchange, and the final co-drawn door image. Ambiguity is purposeful: “ambiguously clear” becomes a resonant conceptual repricing rather than a paradox to solve. Final image reweights the premise: honesty is not spoken but shown, at the cost of former anonymity. No moralizing sentence closes the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited adheres to Mira’s perceptual signature—echo-location, archival noticing, lens-mediated sight. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at the approach: “She stepped forward.” No head-hopping; Theo’s interior is accessed only through external gesture and Mira’s inference. Distinct idiom in “cataloging the final recorded words of those who had passed beyond speech.” Dialogue absent by premise; silence functions as indirection. Psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“crystal whispering,” “ambiguously clear”—taught early and paid off at closure. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. One mixed-metor risk (“calcified around him like ice”) but ice metaphor is isolated and does not recur. Final line lands on concrete image, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-linguistic premise is familiar in SF, but focus on obsolete archivist and disgraced translator meeting through discarded concert tickets offers fresh inflection. Object-exchange as love-language in a wordless world feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—entire story in hush—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail (lens distortion of raindrops, door doodle) prevents generic anywhere setting. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
