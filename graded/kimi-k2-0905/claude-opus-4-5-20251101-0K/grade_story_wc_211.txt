<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her bodily shock when the apples fall in a 12-3-1 code makes her vocation feel lived-in. The contradiction between archivist neutrality and prophetic utterance is dramatized, not declared. Flawed passivity is present—she “lets” the shaving speak her—but the final kneeling/tablet moment converts that liability into earned cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets ignored; single-POV micro-choices (selecting the book, speaking in Linear A) track cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final cuneiform glow crystallizes her shift from recorder to living oath, cost felt in “velvet disquiet.” Causality holds—field-trip memory seeds ability, shaving triggers prophecy, apples confirm coordinates. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“Meridian Tower…3:47 AM”). One micro-turn: archival passivity → accidental prophet. No meaningful escalation under causal lens, but accumulative density reweights stake at end; lens ambiguity waived because pattern taught and closure coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard as micro-setting constrains her choice—no escape, only upward roots; apple-drop code directly shapes final recognition. Sensory triage under crisis: bruised-plum sky, windless leaves, amber spiral—each mirrored in her internal bruise/glow. Tool-as-setting: wax shaving is handled, warmed, and re-weighted at closure. Spatial choreography tight—60-story height felt in vertiginous silence before dawn. No exposition dump; world rules (oath-scribe craft, temporal fold) learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve past vs. speak future—signaled early. Pressure intensifies when apples spell coordinate code; option space narrows from “archive” to “become prophecy.” Cost legible: she kneels, writes glowing cuneiform, accepts unending responsibility. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices at this length. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal; still satisfies one meaningful tightening rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as future, archivist as message. No explicit thesis; final tablet image reweights earlier “archiving emotional patterns” into “being the pattern.” Subtext in apple code—natural fruit bearing artificial coordinates—quietly fuses nature/time/technology. Avoids sermon; complexity held in velvet disquiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archaic-linguistic precision (“Akkadian…Linear A…proto-language”) yet tactile—wax warmth, stylus drag. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences for incantation, fragment at “Accidental prophecy.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Filter verbs used sparingly and voiced (“she felt tears” justified by childhood memory). Diction stays within scribe’s arcane lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence anchors tower, garden, time, profession. No synonym loops; “wax shaving” never padded. Figurative language controlled—one mixed metaphor check (“sky the color of bruised plums”) but image coherent. Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph breath mirrors foghorn silence/dawn resumption. Closure beat clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—oath-scribe on rooftop orchard accidentally prophecies via broken wax spiral—is non-obvious synthesis of archival sci-fi and mythic botanic time-loop. Risk in dense antiquarian diction paid off by emotional clarity. Specificity: 12-3-1 apple drop as pre-writing coordinate system feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes; voice stakes out singular territory.</comment>
