<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s synesthetic bell-harmonics gift is vivid and embodied (“each strike fractured into harmonics that painted the air with color only she could perceive”), and her cathedral-rope micro-choices show a consistent hunger for connection. Interiority stays concrete until the final paragraph, where “willingness to send signals into darkness” drifts toward thesis-speak without new contradiction: a 0.3 slip. The earned realization at the empty recording—silence is full when attended to—caps her arc with visible cost (tears, exhaustion, return to tower), satisfying the 9- gate for renunciation. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; headcount is clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“she would travel by listening”) and held: each recording station layers density until the lens reweights the stake at the final silence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 and is re-anchored at every shard jump; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell-rings become an infinite, unpaid offering whose cost is felt in her aching arms and the city’s unanswering dark. Persistent constraint—the carbide lens as literal focus—shapes every listening choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The laboratory’s acoustic relics (phonograph horns pointing at walls, oscilloscopes dreaming) are sketched with sensory economy and re-enter as tangible tools: the lens spectrum thrown across them at midpoint literally changes what she can see. Golden light “casting shadows that seemed to breathe with warmth” is a micro-setting that foreshadows the later tonal flip to connection as warmth rather than presence. No world-rule contradictions; every object is handled (lens held to ear, dust disturbed) so the environment constrains attention. Meets 9- gate: lens-light on horns directly charges the final bell-strike image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she feel connection without touch?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens once: the empty recording forces the stance crystallization. Each station is a micro-turn that raises the cost of continued solitude; no reversal is needed under Accumulative lens. The final bell-ringing is not a solution but an unending endurance whose price is infinite unanswered vibration. Cost is visible: her body aches, her tears fall, the city stays dark—meets 8.8+ requirement for on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: connection as attention without guarantee. The mother’s canyon call and whale song are concrete particulars that re-weight at the hermit’s silence, avoiding any overt moral. Final paragraph avoids thematic echo; the image of starlit bell-vibrations is resonant, non-didactic. Ambiguity lingers: is she healed or merely resigned?—complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic ear; perceptual signature is consistent (“she could almost taste” whale frequencies). No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, breathless sentences during the whale station, clipped fragments at the empty silence. No register drift; carbide-lens terminology stays within miner-grandmother lexicon. Rhythm under bell-ringing finale mimics tolling cadence—intentional and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer time, sensory cross-talk, and emotional stakes (“The mother reached across a century, across death itself, still calling”). No mixed metaphors; lens-beam → spectrum → loom thread is coherent. One paraphrase loop detected (“connection wasn’t transaction… connection was willingness”) costs −0.2. No artifacts in final third; closure image is uncluttered. Read-aloud rhythm varies with bell-strike repetition used as purposeful pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringer in a post-blackout sound-archive is a fresh synthesis; the pilgrimage-by-listening is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: no antagonist, no dialogue, no physical confrontation—stakes carried by attention itself. Details (carbide lens, 1923 canyon voice) are particular rather than quirky ornament. Emotional specificity carries the piece past quiet-lyric cliché.</comment>
