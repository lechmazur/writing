<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s embodied arc from frost to feeling is credibly anchored in the needle-and-drum beats; the “filament of hush” re-weighting at the end is earned. One hairline slip: “she understood now that…” explanation just before the cavern exit soft-pedals the cost that was already visible. Still, interior contradiction is dramatized, not declared, for most of the piece. Causality of emotional thaw is tracked through tactile vibration rather than therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crystalline Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken needle in pocket + “spring would come” image reweights silence from void to potential with felt cost (tears, unsteady legs). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each drum vibration thickens the pattern until the cadence shift lands. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment needle + large-drum vibration fuses touch and emotion, foreclosing permanent numbness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cavern acts as micro-setting that literally channels vibration into Marina’s body, constraining the only path to feeling; drum-skin tension and leaf-scrape supply tactile immediacy. Sensory selection stays POV-true—sound is never described, only vibration and light-fracture through the needle. Weather/rustle beat returns in final line to re-charge the closure image. Spatial choreography clean: Elias emerges, places feet, guides hands—no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thaw emotional numbness—signaled in para 2; pressure escalates through accumulating vibration density until the single cadence shift (large-drum + needle) crystallizes choice. No antagonist needed; tension is internal-external hybrid: body vs. silence. Cost visible on page: tears, shaky legs, acknowledged future struggle. No coincidence; all turns driven by Marina’s consent to hands-on-drum test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal of silence = absence to silence = space-between-beats; no overt thesis stated. Broken needle as Conceptual Repricing object re-weights “broken” as translator of beauty. Final image of seasons’ rustle offers non-literal answer: cyclical return, not cure. Avoids sentimental uplift by acknowledging numbness “was not defeated in one afternoon.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Marina’s perceptual filter: no sounds, only vibration, light-fracture, leaf-scrape. Syntax lengthens under emotional intensity then compresses at exit (“She rose on unsteady legs”)—rhythm mirrors arc. Elias’s signed dialogue is naturalistic, sub-textual (“You seek the filament of hush”). No head-hopping; camera never leaves Marina’s sensorium. Voice texture distinct: tactile metaphors, no auditory clichés.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets body, object, and emotional valence (“She felt the silence first…”). No synonym loops; “vibration” recurs but each time with new sensory layer. Metaphors stay physically coherent (light through water). Final third is clean—no figurative muddle to dull closure. Minor scaffold: “She had… she had…” anaphora in para 2 is pattern-taught and pays off in final para, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf music teacher healed by backward-recorded silence filament—is non-obvious yet believable in world. Risk of concept-story is offset by grounded drum-cavern mechanics and tactile specificity. Transformation test: arc collapses if Marina can hear. Needle-as-philosophical-object feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. No close literary echoes; avoids inspirational-disability cliché by leaving struggle open.</comment>
