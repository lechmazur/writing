<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“chef’s knife strapped to her thigh like a talisman” instantiates profession + curse in one image. The contagious-touch curse is embodied, not labeled, when she flinches from Cassius then chooses contact at the end. Micro-choice in the pavilion—hand on coral, deliberate second touch to filter what she off-loads—earns the partial release. Cost is felt: she keeps the compassionate residue, trading perpetual tremor for manageable ache; the endurance is credibly scaled to 750-word arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: curse → quest → map-reading → pavilion → selective transfer → restored touch, each step a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: she refuses total amnesia, pays with perpetual partial ache yet regains human contact—cost legible in “hands that no longer tremble.” Orientation anchor (fortress courtyard, post-rain, knife) lands by line 4; no penalty. One tightening beat: coral contact shows emptiness risk, forcing surgical second touch that forecloses full abdication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the chef’s knife, tidal pools, and coral ice constrain every tactical move. Rain-softened sand enables literal descent; evaporative clock (“wouldn’t last the afternoon”) pressures map-reading. Pavilion ice is remorse made tangible, charging the final image of moderated guilt. Sensory triangulation—metallic taste of regret, petrichor, cold coral—anchors each emotional pivot without catalogue excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“deposit remorse or keep bleeding on others”—is declared early and tightened once: pavilion offers total dump, she instead surgical slices, narrowing future options to ‘filtered contagion.’ Cost is visible (partial ache retained) and alters tactics: she can now touch willingly. No reversal inflation; single meaningful escalation suffices. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—pain as teacher versus pain as mere wound—emerges through coral’s double revelation: total erasure = emptiness, curated remorse = compassion. No authorial thesis; final line’s “gentle reminder” is image-driven. Subtext in Cassius’s flinch-to-wonder shift shows transferred weight without exposition. Complexity upheld: she doesn’t achieve purity but managed empathy, resisting sentimental cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, gustatory, desert-weathered: “tasted petrichor… older—metallic tang.” Syntax mirrors pressure—long, breath-filled clauses pre-pavilion; short, cold fragments during ice contact. Diction stays within culinary + carceral lexicons (talons of coral, sandpaper rough memories). No dialogue contamination; brief Cassius query carries keeper’s weary knowledge through syntax alone. Consistent perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “rain had stopped three hours ago” packs time, smell, backstory. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—coral growth = memory accretion; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or image. Copy-clean except single hyphen instead of em-dash in dialogue, negligible at this length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + contagious touch + remore-storage pavilion synthesizes into fresh emotional tech. Concept follows implication: if remorse can be off-loaded, hollowing is risk; partial retention becomes moral choice. Culinary curse links occupation to empathy mechanism—inevitable yet uncliched. Final image of “gentle reminder” reframes universal guilt theme without platitude. Risky structure (descent into ice-coral) pays off through sensory logic.</comment>
