<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marek’s lifetime of tending, waiting, and finally choosing to exhale wonder into soil is rendered through embodied micro-choices (cupping fruit, exhaling, weeping). The contradiction between resignation and stubborn generativity is active in every beat; final endurance costs him his remaining life span, legible in “he was old now, truly old,” yet the garden’s survival is tied to that cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority stays concrete and orchard-bound. The only limit keeping this from 9.5+ is that external pressure stays abstract—no second character or status clash to sharpen stakes further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise: the new tree rekindles fading colors and Marek forecloses personal rest to keep pruning, cost visible in the mirrored “radiant and hush.” Causal chain—seed needs essence → gathered by witnessing → sapling feeds garden—holds without gaps under a lyrical accumulative lens. Orientation is swift: “verdant parapet beside a waterfall” by ~60 words. Slight reservation: if read strictly under causal rules, the external antagonist (“worlds forgetting how to dream”) stays off-page, nudging it below 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden functions as micro-setting: every described anomaly (no-height waterfall, seven-sun light) directly enables Marek’s essence-gathering tactic. Sensory triage favors shifting color and sound over catalog, mirroring his painterly attention. Spatial coherence holds as he kneels, cups, exhales; bodies and tools stay tracked. The final image of rainbowed mist through the new tree recharges earlier waterfall motif, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—signaled in third paragraph and tightens when colors fade; Marek’s agency (gather essence, plant seed, keep pruning) drives every escalation. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length: hue loss → seed sprout → garden revival, each phase paid for by bodily attention and foreclosed leisure. Cost is visible in his exhaustion and the blade across his knees. Antagonistic pressure remains conceptual rather than embodied, capping it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as creation—emerges through pruning metaphor and the transfer of witnessed beauty; no character states it aloud. Grandma’s seed reappears reweighted: once symbol of futile hope, now conduit of inter-world renewal. Final image crystallizes the paradox: cutting away sustains life. Ambiguity lingers—will future pruners remember?—inviting reflection without moralizing. Only hairline gap: worlds’ forgetting is told more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance tethered to Marek’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is orchard-man: “pruning with the wisdom of someone who knew that cutting away was itself an act of creation.” Syntax modulates between long lyrical loops and short ceremonial beats (“Marek wept.”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone; occasional elevated diction (“succor,” “insatiably”) fits a fable register without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fat-free: simultaneous world-building, character, and mood in single phrases—“fruit that shimmered with hues that had no names in his language.” Metaphors stay orchard-bound, internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with escalating sentence fragmentation under emotional peaks. One minor loop: “colors that had never existed before” slightly repeats “colors no living eye had seen,” but it occurs early and does not blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment>
<comment>Fuses climate-fantasy orchard with meta-creative thesis in a way that feels fresh yet inevitable. The “threshold garden” trope is reanimated through horticultural procedure—pruning, grafting essence—rather than portal mechanics. Risk: 40-year montage in 800 words could have flattened pressure, yet accumulative design teaches pattern by ~25% and lands a resonant reconfiguration, earning the +0.2 risk bonus. No close echoes of canonical scenes; specificity (moon-fed pears, volcanic apples) is story-native.</comment>
