<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s guardedness is shown through her satchel ritual and warlike serenity; the three-year backstory is anchored to a present micro-choice (casting the seed). The final unbending is earned—her spine straightens only after she speaks the confession aloud—yet the interiority occasionally drifts toward self-diagnosis (“she understood what mirrors didn’t show”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seed-creates-path → face-melts → reflection returns. The 120-word anchor is clean (island, vortex, seed in hand). Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the mirror now shows her face because she finished the sentence that fear had truncated; the cost is the three years of lifespan already paid and the vortex’s lingering quiet. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The swirling orchard is not postcard scenery—it supplies the rotating trunks the vine must grip, the frozen confession tree supplies the final face-melt, and the still water at the end mirrors her restored reflection. Micro-setting (the seed in palm, the cold bark against skin) constrains her next step. One hairline slip: “dark water” and “mist” are visual clichés amid otherwise sharp sensory selection, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the reflection/self—signaled in paragraph two. Mid-story tightening: the vine’s hunger could turn on her, narrowing options. Final cost is visible: lifespan already spent, vortex pacified but not destroyed, reflection restored yet older. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image chain: unfinished confession → frozen face → completed sentence → restored reflection. No moralizing line tells us “self-belief matters”; the final image of the shadow stretching “faithfully” reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. The ambiguity—orchard still spins, only quieter—invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: “oily hunger” is her appraisal, “warlike serenity” her self-calibration. Syntax lengthens under pressure then snaps short at the spoken affirmation. One minor filter-stack (“she recognized the expression immediately”) but voice remains distinct and consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “vines erupted upward, black and thorned” does three jobs—action, color, danger—in six words. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A single mixed metaphor (“wind tearing at her cloak” while she is already inside the vine-path) barely grazes clarity; otherwise rhythm breathes with the ascent and lands a clean final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The frozen-confession tree reframes the classic “missing reflection” trope into a literal graveyard of unfinished truths; the flesh-eating plant as stepladder is fresh and thematically apt—hunger devours hunger. Risk taken: the entire external world is a metaphor for internal absence, yet the logic stays internally consistent and the emotional cost remains visceral. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
