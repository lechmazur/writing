<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s grief-driven search is credibly anchored in the hotel key and Elena’s past; his interiority stays concrete (“the tool he used each night…”). The final renunciation—carrying the secret rather than exposing it—earns its cost via the vial’s vision and the lantern ascent. micro-choices are sparse but purposeful (uncorking vial, standing in dark water). Missing is a second layer of internal contradiction mid-scene to push him past 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lantern sky reweights the premise, color-sound synesthesia now forever visible to Marcus alone, cost felt in his isolation. Causal chain holds: key → journal → vial → irreversible perception shift. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Minor ellipsis (how algae keeps air pocket dry) is accepted SF-given; it never resolves the conflict, only decorates. Final image reprises “meteor hush” with new, synesthetic light, satisfying both lens and cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drowned-library air-pocket is sketched with tactile specificity—“shelves lined the walls at impossible angles,” bioluminescent algae as sole light source—and directly enables the vial discovery. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves during tilted-shelf traversal. The lantern release above waves supplies the final, sky-wide setting that charges closure. Micro-setting applies: the hotel key’s brass slot in the journal spine literally unlocks the hidden vial, altering tactics on-page. All rules taught early; no credibility breaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Marcus access Elena’s hidden truth—tightens once: key → journal → vial → irreversible perception. Cost is visible: he forfeits ignorant peace, now condemned to see emotional chromatics. Agency is entirely his; coincidence (dry library) complicates but doesn’t resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices; no second reversal required at this length. Could edge 8.2 if a mid-scene obstacle had threatened to deny him the vial, forcing a harder trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—some truths must stay private because their luminosity burns—emerges solely through Marcus’s choice to leave the ship in silence, never moralized. Subtext is carried by the lantern image: shared public grief vs. private synesthetic vision. No thematic echo lines; final paragraph’s “lantern in his chest” reweights earlier sky-lantern release with private, invisible light. Complexity acknowledged: townspeople’s simpler ritual is not mocked, merely surpassed by Marcus’s costlier sight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close stays tightly filtered through Marcus’s mariner-lamplighter perceptual set: “slow-motion stars,” “meteor hush.” Syntax lengthens for awe, shortens under vial release without template drift. No dialogue, hence no register clash. Free-indirect slips are clean: “He should have been there” carries self-judgment without filter verbs. Occasional elevated diction (“synesthetic resonance”) is justified by Elena’s academic ghost; POV absorbs it as remembered jargon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors descent-to-revelation arc: long, accumulating clauses tighten into short imagist bursts at vial release. Mixed metaphors avoided; “colors rose like smoke” stays coherent within synesthetic logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening line anchors voice and mystery simultaneously. Only minor hedge—“impossibly dry” could lose “impossibly”—but effect is purposeful, not slack. Closure image is uncluttered, letting final line resonate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic vow-distillation inside a dry sunken library is a fresh conceptual synthesis; maritime-gothic meets perceptual sci-fi. Lantern festival & hotel skeleton key are familiar noir icons, but their function—key as literal literary lock, lanterns as public counterpart to private chromatic sky—reinflects rather than repeats. Emotional specificity sells the novelty: widower’s fear that truth might outshine love. Risk in concept pays off cleanly without late rule dodge. Could crest 9.0 with a sharper twist on Elena’s motive for hiding the vial.</comment>
