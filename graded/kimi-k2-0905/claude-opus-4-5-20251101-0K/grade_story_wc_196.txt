<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—dust-reading as scripture, the “tenderness unfurling” after Marcus—and her decision to re-archive the button rather than claim it crystallizes her renunciation with cost. The 1867 clerk and Thomas remain off-page, so status/relationship tests are waived; solo-POV rules apply and she passes. No contradictory impulses are staged in live scene: the beat is solitary, reflective, so the 9+ quick test fails by hairline. Still, the embodied emotion and earned stasis are strong enough for low-8 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust pattern → button discovery → database vow; each layer adds density without causal reversals, landing in Charged Poise—“she would also never stop looking”—with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalties. Closure effect is present and reweights earlier material. Missing one tightening turn that forecloses an option on-page keeps it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dust, file room, button, and bodily gesture (bending, finger-tracing) are filtered through Eleanor’s archival gaze; the micro-setting constrains her solitary choice. 1867 Philadelphia is named only, not inhabited, but the Union button satisfies the “tool/object that charges final image” test for 9+ gate. No spatial confusion; sensory balance favors sight/touch aligned with her vocation. Vividness never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“magnify small kindnesses so they are not lost”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via button discovery that deepens the moral weight rather than narrows external options. No reversal or antagonist, but accumulative pressure suffices under Textural lens. Cost is conceptual (perpetual broken-hearted looking) rather than a tangible loss on-page, keeping it below 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: archival devotion as antidote to personal abandonment. Button and dust motifs reconfigure love’s endurance without moralizing. Final sentence pair offers resonant, non-literal answer—“never stop being broken-hearted… never stop looking”—that reweights premise. Complexity is honored; no pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature (“learned to read dust like scripture”) is distinctive and sustained. Syntax modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped closing declarations, mirroring shift from memory to resolve. No dialogue, so voice tests default to narration; register stays within Eleanor’s plausible lexicon. One hairline slip—“something unfurl in her chest” approaches cliché—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“dust patterns like scripture”). Opening and closing lines perform framing work. One participle opener (“Presenting this button…”) is tolerated without clarity harm. Clean copy, strong paragraph cut-test pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freedmen’s Bureau archive + foster-care dust-reading is fresh territory; archival grief as love’s residue feels non-obvious. Union button repurposed as promissory token rather than patriotic symbol deepens the angle. Story would collapse if button swapped or dust method removed; high specificity prevents generic overlay. Minor risk in reflective mode is controlled and coherent.</comment>
