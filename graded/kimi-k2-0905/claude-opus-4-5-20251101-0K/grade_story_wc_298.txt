<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for certainty yet choosing lifelong doubt—play out in the decisive beat beneath the bone-tree; the cost (forty years of unknowing) is legible and scaled to the story’s length. Interiority stays concrete, anchored to the lantern, the ash, the chest-cavity “wounded bird.” No label-speak; the hole is shown through action and refusal. The final smile in true darkness crystallizes earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (descent → offer → acceptance → emergence) links by because/therefore, tightening until the final image reweights “possibility.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—uncertainty becomes the price of self-ownership—and the cost is on-page in the Gardener’s warning and her smile in darkness. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or retro-patches. One meaningful deepening suffices at 735 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop; root-bone geometry and phosphorescent moss constrain movement and echo the ledger of trades, charging the final ascent into “true darkness.” The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting—handled, crumbled, and reweighted at the hinge beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s urgency: mineral smell, skeletal patterns, the tactile ash. Environment, body, and tool together shape the choice and the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“patch the hole in her soul”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates when the Gardener reframes the price as perpetual uncertainty. One decisive tightening: the moment she accepts forty years of doubt forecloses any later appeal. Agency drives the turn; luck merely complicates. Cost is visible in the card’s disintegration and her grandmother’s off-page death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of certainty and ownership: trading away guaranteed fate buys authentic agency. Subtext lives in gesture—gentle skeletal hands pruning pale apples—rather than exposition. The closing smile in darkness offers a non-literal answer: uncertainty itself is the soul’s reclaimed territory. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance is carried by image and ash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“mineral memory,” “wounded bird”) is hers, not tour-guide. Rhythm accelerates during the bargain, then breathes in the final ascent. No head-hopping; Gardener’s voice is external and distinct. Compression (“fiercely gentle, soft as moss, warm as decay”) is patterned and paid off in his touch at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“darkness pooling in his eye sockets”—never stacked. Information density is high: each sentence advances stakes, image, or causality. Ash crumble and smile land without prose clutter; no scaffolding obscures the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The soul-trading orchard of bones and moonstone apples feels inevitable yet fresh; tarot-as-receipt and uncertainty-as-price synthesize mythic and psychological registers. Risk—choosing lifelong doubt as victory—eschews symmetric safety. Specific detail (root-avoided bones, phosphorescent moss ceiling) prevents generic dark-fantasy pastiche. Transformation test fails if moved to another setting; the orchard’s ledger is integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Reckless idealism is setup early, dramatized in the solitary descent, and culminates in the high-risk acceptance of permanent uncertainty; without it the bargain collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Burned Tower card appears in pocket, handled mid-scene, and disintegrates at the hinge beat; its ash marks the irreversible trade and reweights destiny in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Bartered destinies are not backdrop but operational logic: every bone pattern is a ledger, the card is currency, and the climax is a forced renegotiation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fiercely gentle governs the Gardener’s touch while pruning and while reaching into Mira’s chest; the trait enables the extraction and makes the price feel merciful yet absolute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Trammel is the story’s pivotal verb: the Gardener literally rebinds fate to her; remove the action and the entire plot—grandmother’s death, Mira’s reclaimed agency—unravels.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Inlaying meaning is signaled early (“every detail mattered”) and shapes how Mira reads root-bone patterns; the skill justifies her trust in the bargain and charges the final ascent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard constrains movement, supplies the currency of bones, and provides the only site where destiny can be rewired; setting and stakes are inseparable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Half-lit corridors create perpetual twilight that removes urgency; time is atmospheric rather than tactical, so the element shapes mood more than decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The soul-hole motivates descent, frames the bargain, and is finally filled—albeit with uncertainty—making the motivation indispensable to every major beat and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dusky resolve permeates prose, modulating from twilight descent through gentle decay to the final smile in true darkness; tone carries the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
