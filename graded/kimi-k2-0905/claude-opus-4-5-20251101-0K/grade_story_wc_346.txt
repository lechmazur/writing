<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mira’s grief-fuelled vocation is credible and particular; the broken puppet head acts as an embodied conduit for her contradictory impulses—love, guilt, transcendence—so her final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“pressed her lips to its cracked crown”) rather than therapeutic. The one hairline slip is the slightly abstract “beautifully flawed existence” tag; otherwise flaws complicate every beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the clock frozen at 00:00:01 and the inward-beam re-weight the entire premise, showing the cost is her life/epoch. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal, taught early by the nested-patterns talk and paid off when resonance carries the lullaby backward. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are inside 120 words and serve the final image. No lens ambiguity; the hush-pane makes the cost legible on the last line.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse-in-dusk micro-setting directly constrains her tactics: the glass walls become the “pane of hush,” the console is the only interface, the beam direction reverses to inward. Sensory selection is urgent—obsidian face, amber-and-bruise light, cracked wood—all filtered through a professional timer’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral stairs → lantern room → console → kneel. The final image is charged by the setting itself becoming the delivery system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—softening the apocalypse via lullaby—is signalled in para 1 and tightens once: calibration → resonance → irreversible beam inversion. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal turns: each adjustment narrows her physical stamina and enlarges the temporal reach until she forfeits escape. Cost is visible—kneeling, tears, frozen clock—so the price is on-page. No coincidence; all pressure is self-inflicted under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: a broken toy, a mother’s song, and an obsidian clock together re-price “endings” as something that can only be softened, not prevented. No moralizing; the final image of the hollow eye now “full of stars” reweights the puppet head into cosmic cradle. Subtext operates in silence—she never says “I love you” or “I forgive myself,” yet the beam does it for her. Complexity is retained: apocalypse still looms, but a single kindness now has infinite reach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical with compressed, taught pattern: “seconds folded into centuries” is immediately legible and paid off. Perceptual signature is Mira’s—she sees time as fabric, wood as mouth, light as vehicle—so diction stays inside her timer-mystic lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into breathless short clauses during calibration, then exhales into the long lullaby line. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is coherent (beam, ripple, harp strings) and never self-contradictory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new information or sensory layer. Figurative language is disciplined—one commanding metaphor per beat, no purple pile-ons. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the beam/puppet pairing. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with her physical effort, no mechanical template rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: doomsday-clock mechanic + lullaby delivery system = soft-apocalypse lull. Familiar tropes (lighthouse, clock, apocalypse) are retooled through maternal grief and acoustic resonance, making them feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure is high yet coherence never breaks. Specific detail—“nested patterns,” “sideways into directions that shouldn’t exist”—prevents generic anywhere/anytime vagueness.</comment>
