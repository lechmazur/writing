<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—archivist of extinction who fears emotional exposure—drives every beat; the shell-writing choice crystallizes her flaw and costs her professional detachment. Pearl callback and phone reply embody embodied emotion. Only minor slip: “afraid too” text feels slightly convenient, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: shells removed, text sent, option space reconfigured between ex-spouses with the cave’s latent radiance now reframed as possibility rather than dread. Causal chain holds: inspection → discovery → inscription → transmission → reciprocal admission. No orientation drift; transitions tight under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal walls, mineral flash, and spiral shells are tactile, selective, and mirror internal fracture/refraction. Setting constrains the final act: only the cave’s blank shells enable Elena's inscription, making environment instrumental to closure. Spatial choreography clean; sensory hierarchy filtered through POV priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice the unsaid—tightens when each shell confession raises the cost of silence; Elena’s own inscription forecloses emotional bunkering. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost legible in abandoned clipboard and exposed heart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: survival without disclosure is merely prolonged burial. Subtext operates through shell spirals, pearl necklace, and mirrored refusals. Final image reweights “latent radiance” from atomic dread to interpersonal hope without moralizing. Complexity preserved: reunion is possible, not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—engineer’s light-meter precision meets mineral poetics—remains distinct. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elena's plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: clipped inspection notes swell to spiral inscription cadence, supporting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propels: varied sentence lengths, strong verbs, minimal filters. One paraphrase loop (“words…words” in paragraph 7) and one stock phrase (“throat tightened”) are minor scaffolds. No mixed metaphors; figurative language serves refraction motif. Clean copy, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic bunker repurposed as confessional chapel feels fresh; shell-archive device transforms familiar regret motif. Synthesis of nuclear dread and intimate silence is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet epistolary climax heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
