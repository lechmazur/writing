<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers mixing ash and charcoal, the mask warming against her face—yet the moment she “wants to crystallize this fleeting emotion” remains abstract, not dramatized as a contradictory impulse. The inherited duty and her quiet acceptance earn a credible endurance, but the lack of a micro-choice that costs her something immediate keeps the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mingled ashes settling into the floorboards reweights the gallery’s impossible horizon, making grandmother part of the vanishing point itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (dust motes, mask warmth, rocking-chair rhythm) deepens the stake until the final scatter crystallizes the new state with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Vanishing Point Gallery is not backdrop but active constraint: its receding paintings and threshold literally receive the ashes, turning environment into participant. Micro-setting objects—porcelain mask, rocking chair—dictate touch and tempo, charging the final image when Marina restarts the chair’s rhythm, re-anchoring presence inside absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens once: the ritual scatter is the single decisive act that forecloses any alternative farewell. The cost is legible—grandmother is irretrievably dispersed into the floorboards—yet the escalation is more ceremonial than contested, keeping the score high but not maximal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: partial portraits as merciful incompleteness, the vanishing point as sustainable mirage. The final image of restarted rocking chair offers a resonant, non-literal answer—grief becomes motion, not monument—achieving CR that reweights all prior reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains a hush appropriate to gallery silence; syntax lengthens and softens, mirroring the act of scattering. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Marina’s tactile precision—ash texture, mask edges—consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language (“each one a tiny universe suspended in grief”) is selective and purposeful. One scaffold echo—“the vanishing point itself” repeated near opening and close—feels intentional reprise rather than loop, but a slight overture of adjectival uplift (“impossible space,” “haunting and whole”) keeps it from flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The porcelain-tea-set mask transforming a shattered domestic past into ritual face is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—gallery as afterlife conduit—pays off because the physics stay metaphorical and the emotional cost remains grounded.</comment>
