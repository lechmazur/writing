<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is granular—fingers moving “through muscle memory,” the buckle’s cold against bone—showing contradictory impulses (duty vs. survival) in real time. The final refusal to fake certainty is earned by her mother’s fatal fall and by the six-hour vigil that follows; the buckle’s transfer from talisman to archived relic shows visible cost. Micro-choices (crossing out conclusions, unclasping the buckle) externalize value hierarchy cleanly. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: mother’s parachute death → Vera’s epistemic humility → refusal to lie → partial evacuation → dawn validation. Closure is Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual doubt as the watcher’s price, re-clasping the buckle only to archive it. Cost is legible in the sunrise line where the parachute metal is held “toward the sunrise” then set aside, foreclosing the comfort of inherited certainty. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Nocturnal arbor” canopy above cloud layer is more than backdrop: its sway, wind whispers, and starlight access shape both data clarity and psychological isolation. The buckle, the spectral lens, and the radio static function as micro-settings that gate every decision. Spatial choreography is clean: Vera crouched, fingers on buckle, radio within reach, no teleporting props. Final image of clouds “shimmered gold and pink” reweights the arbor from alien perch to communal shield, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trust in the watcher’s word versus thousands of lives—tightens when partial evacuation is chosen, narrowing options: she cannot retract once she admits uncertainty. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals: data refusal to resolve → civic panic risk → her six-hour vigil. Cost is visible social friction (“panic”) and personal forfeiture of inherited certainty. Agency is decision-based; coincidence absent. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping score just under the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of honest uncertainty emerges through concrete pattern-seeking ritual, not assertion; the buckle’s shift from comfort to archive embodies the conceptual repricing. Subtext lives in silence: Ash’s radio pause after “We don’t know” carries more weight than any speech. Final sunrise image answers the core question—how to live with doubt—without moralizing. No motif is token; every return (static, buckle, clouds) reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Vera’s perceptual filter: “ancient trees had grown so tall their canopy pierced the cloud layer” is her lifelong gaze, not omniscient lore. Syntax mirrors her methodical mind—parallel calibrate/check sequences—then fractures into shorter beats under decision pressure. No head-hopping; radio voice remains external, tinny. Diction stays within her technical lexicon; “spectral lens,” “pressure differentials” feel learned at her mother’s side.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density is high—“thermal anomalies matched volcanic precursors, but the pressure readings contradicted” packs stakes, data, conflict into one line. Mixed metaphor check clean: cloud “shimmered gold and pink” is single coherent image. Only minor scaffold: “patterns emerged … patterns refused to resolve” is deliberate recursion, not loop. Closure line “waited for the patterns to speak again” lands with crisp propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Watcher lineage above cloud layer is fresh world logic; inversion of heroic certainty into heroic doubt feels non-obvious. Trope of lone sentinel is retooled through epistemic humility rather than omniscience. Specificity—“spectral lens,” “wind gauges” grounded in tactile ritual—prevents abstract drift. Risk taken in eschewing eruption payoff pays off thematically, though some readers may want catharsis; hence not quite 8.5.</comment>
