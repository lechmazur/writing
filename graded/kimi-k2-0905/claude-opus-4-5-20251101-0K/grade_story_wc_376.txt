<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s “wilts near dishonesty” trait is not merely stated: it physically compels her six-hour descent and shapes her mother’s evasive strategy, giving the quest visceral stakes. Interiority is concrete—her lungs tighten, her hands shake—rather than abstract. The final inscription (“Where lost conversations wait to be found”) crystallizes an earned renunciation: she accepts partial truth as the price of protecting others from the same pain. Micro-choices (bringing gilding tools, braving tunnels) trace a clear values hierarchy; the emotional cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mei Lin does not confront her dead parents, but her final act re-weights the premise—truth is no longer absolute but curated for mercy. The causal lens holds because every prior breadcrumb (fragmented map, intolerance for lies, father’s recorded plea) renders this acceptance inevitable. Cost is legible in the depleted archive and her trembling hand setting the gold into stone. No teleporting props; the postal fragment’s partial address motivates the floorboard search and the playback station delivers the withheld truth exactly when she is strong enough to bear it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse domes function as micro-setting: their sulfurous glass and evaporated lake create the oxygen-scarce pressure that makes “lost words” precious currency. Tactile lived-in detail—warm pane against forehead, rust-smell in tunnels—anchors orientation early. The Archive’s magnetic-tape cathedral is not ornamental; it supplies the playback station that forces Mei Lin’s final stance. Spatial choreography stays clean: fragments are spread on floorboards, tools clink in bag, inscription happens at the threshold—each beat is locatable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where lost conversations go”—is signaled in line 2 and tightens when the map reveals “Archive.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each shredded scrap increases density until the playback station re-weights the meaning of “truth.” Mei Lin’s agency is present—she descends, pieces, listens—but the final cost is conceptual rather than physical, fitting the lens. One credible loss: mother’s silence is permanent, a social foreclosure that shapes Mei Lin’s new vocation as guardian of partial truths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between candor and mercy: every dramatized beat tests whether absolute honesty is a kindness. The final inscription turns the motif—gold leaf, once used for memorials, now frames a shrine to withheld speech, reframing candor as curated rather than total. Subtext operates in gestures: trembling hands, the act of listening rather than speaking. No moral is stated; the emotional after-effect is the ache of accepting necessary incompleteness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mei Lin; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture (gold leaf, tape spools) over abstract concepts. Free indirect style is clean: “She should have told you…” slips into mother’s idiom without head-hop. Diction remains within Mei Lin’s artisanal lexicon—“zinc-etched,” “gilded-leaf”—never drifts into academic register. Rhythm mirrors tension: short clauses during descent, longer lyrical sweep in the archive; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety is purposeful; parataxis speeds the tunnel crawl, while cumulative syntax slows for the reveal. No loops or synonym churn; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors are selective—“soap bubbles refusing to burst”—and physically coherent with the glass domes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the motif of gilded inscription as both memory and veil.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “ Archive of lost conversations” is a fresh speculative twist on undelivered mail; it grows organically from the pre-existing postal-collapse world rather than feeling grafted. Tropes (orphan seeking parent truth) are re-weighted through the biological lie-detector condition, making the quest a physical necessity, not a sentimental choice. Specificity—gold leaf on urns, sulfurous sky yellowing glass—prevents generic anywhere/anytime drift. The final inversion (truth partially withheld to protect) feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
