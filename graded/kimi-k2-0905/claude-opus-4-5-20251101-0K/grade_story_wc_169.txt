<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. bereft mother—is vivid, embodied in trembling palms on brass. The lucid-watchful trait enables the grotto experiment, but the shift from passive observation to “tomorrow she would contact Geneva” is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; micro-choice is summary, not beat. Grandmother memory supplies motive yet stays reflective, never forcing an on-page mistake or trade-off. Emotional hierarchy is clear; still, the arc lands in assertion, not compelled action with price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: triangle → Geneva trial reweights hope from diffuse to single direction with real opportunity cost (time, money, Elise’s fragility). Causal chain intact: grief → grotto discovery → bead experiment → Hoffman signal; no teleporting props. One shard, single POV, orientation anchored by ~120 words. Cost is felt but off-page; no constraint or price is dramatized at exit to foreclose alternatives, holding the beat below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Limestone veins, salt mist, dripping rhythm are selective, tactile, filtered through physicist attention; grotto architecture guides bead placement and refracts timelines, directly shaping method. Brass gauge serves as micro-setting/tool that constrains choice—its warming signals viable pattern. Sensory hierarchy tightens under crisis: light fracturing first, sound of water, then tactile warmth. Final ascent into sun recharges tide-polished motif with new navigational intent; no static “white-room” lapses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elise’s survival—signaled on arrival; bead configurations tighten options from many timelines to one viable treatment, meaningful narrowing under causal lens. Escalation is intellectual: each triangle flash increases emotional cost of ignoring Geneva path. No external antagonist, but disease pressure and maternal refusal to accept “unsolvable” keep tension coherent. Price exists (effort, risk, hope), yet not dramatized on exit; hence stops short of top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through trial-balloon motif: hope as iterative experiment, not prediction. Subtextual opposition between scientific method and parental desperation refracted in light shards; no explicit moral. Final image of surfacing into sun reweights altitude gauge’s meaning from nostalgia to navigational mandate. Avoids tidy maxim; complexity intact, resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited retains physicist lexicon (“variable,” “equation,” “quantum entanglement”) without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in grotto calm, tighter fragments during light fracture. Figurative language (“contradictions like water in cupped hands”) stays within Marina’s metaphoric range. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct and stable through beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm fluid; sentence length variety mirrors breathing of cave. Density high: “grief had driven her to the coastline and desperation had led her underground” collapses backstory into one propulsive line. Occasional adjective stacks (“serene upheaval,” “patient ocean”) verge on overwriting but are patterned early and reinforce theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; pronouns clean, grammar exact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Grief-stricken physicist weaponizing refracted timelines through bead permutations feels fresh; trial-balloon trope inverted from meteorology to quantum parenting. Grotto as laboratory literalizes “test universe” concept without gimmickry. Specificity of grandmother’s gauge and Geneva trial grounds speculative frame. Risk-taking coherent; not a stitched prompt response.</comment>
