<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s tactile “reading” of objects as poems is vivid and idiosyncratic; the braided rope beats let contradictory impulses (terror / aliveness) thrum at once. Interiority seldom slides into label-speak, and micro-choice—handing the rope to the woman—crystallizes his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The flaw is mild over-articulation: four abstract “about” sentences in the grotto flatten embodied pressure. Still, the final renunciation of safety for textured time is earned by the rope’s prior pulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope reweights “time accumulates” from thesis to lived cost, felt when the woman whispers “alive.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of object-readings thickens until the final grotto layer reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 10; no lens ambiguity. Minor causality dip: the woman’s arrival is lightly coincidental, but her entrance complicates rather than solves, so allowed under Situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop but instrument: warm clay pulses under back/hips, star-fissures pattern the page, forcing reclining-sharing choice. Rope micro-setting constrains the climax—fiber texture must be handled to complete the pattern. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over visual, matching Marcus’s bias. One soft cliché—“rivers of abandonment”—but overwritten sentences are sparse; no 9+ gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“does time accumulate?”—is signaled early; escalation is the densifying rope-readings that foreclose abstract safety in favor of tactile risk. Single meaningful tightening: handing the rope to the woman makes the cost communal and irreversible. Agency is accretive rather than causal, fitting the lyric lens; price (shared exposure, shelter uncertainty) is legible. No visible secondary loss, so caps at 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from rope’s shifting register: escape artifact → time-text → shared sacrament; no final-paragraph sermon. Subtext in gesture: woman’s closed eyes trump any explanatory line. The conceptual repricing reweights “poetry” from beauty-capture to pattern-revelation without asserting it. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if play avoids or honors weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—synesthetic “starlight filtered like auroras with intention”—stays character-specific and rhythmic. Compression taught early (“texture, presence, the weight of moments”) pays off in closing cadence. No dialogue contamination; single POV maintains modesty. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction sneaks into narrative, but isolated; does not breach 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphora (“choice by impossible choice”) against clipped notebook scratches. Information density high—one sentence can anchor body, object, concept. Two near-paraphrase loops (“accumulated experience embedded in matter” / “time had texture”) dock −0.2. No mixed metaphors; props tracked cleanly. Closure image (“pattern continued…”) remains luminous, unobscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-alien gentlepocalypse as hush that restores depth rather than tech-upgrade. Object-as-poem method is non-obvious, grows inevitable via rope. Risk—lyric static scene—pays off by making stillness crackle. No close echoes of canonical escape-rope imagery; transformation is local and specific.</comment>
