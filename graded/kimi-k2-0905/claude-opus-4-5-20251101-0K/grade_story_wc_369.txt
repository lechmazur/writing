<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief is embodied in the forty-one units she keeps returning to; the micro-choice to kneel and thank the oak externalizes her shift from custodian to witness. The contradiction between her need to measure sorrow and her new willingness to release it plays out in a single tactile beat. Cost is legible: she accepts that some sorrows stay, and her rounds now serve the trees, not the hedges. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final smile is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief units accrue, the sextant reassembles, and the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s “thank you” releases fourteen units and crystallizes her new vocation. Cost is on-page: she forfeits the illusion of private grief and accepts perpetual custodianship of shared memory. Orientation is clean by line 5; no因果 turns are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower study’s dust, cracked window, and silvered moonlight are filtered through Maren’s caretaker gaze; the sextant itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Rain “like desperate fingers” is the only risk toward cliché, but it is brief and immediately grounded in her breath-hold. Spatial choreography is flawless: ascent, table, window, descent. The oak’s bark under palm charges the last image with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can grief be returned to the living archive?—tightens when the healed sextant forces Maren to decide: keep measuring or begin releasing. The forty-one units beneath the cypress remain, proving the price is real and the option of total erasure is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each tree’s numeric weight accumulates until the moonlit moment reconfigures her vocation. No coincidence resolves; the storm merely pauses to let the reassembly complete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the sextant’s repurposing: memory is not stolen but witnessed, and sorrow must be tended, not trimmed. The trees’ quantified grief reframes mourning as communal stewardship rather than private possession. No moral is stated; the final whispered thanks lets the oak absorb and return the release. The concept of “mundane miracles” is dramatized, not asserted, in the brass that drinks moonlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices hedge thickness, mirror fractures, unit counts. Syntax lengthens during reflection—“The trees had taken it, held it, kept it safe”—then shortens at the beat of release: “Fourteen units of old grief released like breath.” No dialogue appears, so voice purity is judged solely on narrative rhythm, which modulates cleanly with pressure. The only elevated phrase—“quantified sorrow”—is justified as her own coined term.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She watched, breath held, as the bent brass straightened itself” shows action, object, and interiority in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new information or sensory shift. Metaphors are spare and precise—“silver light streaming through the cracked window”—without stacked vehicles. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors dawn calm after storm, propelling closure without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of arboricultural caretaking with astrolabe mechanics feels inevitable: both are instruments of orientation. Quantified sorrow is a fresh inflection on the old trope of trees holding memory. The sextant’s moonlit self-repair subverts expected star-mapping, turning navigation inward to grief cartography. Risk is taken—numeric emotion could read gimmicky—but the tactile release at the end grounds the concept in felt cost.</comment>
