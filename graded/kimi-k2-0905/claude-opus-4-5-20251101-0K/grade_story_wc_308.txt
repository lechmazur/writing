<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vessa’s decades-long immobility is credibly anchored in her first, fatal climb; the arrowhead’s warmth and her single smile embody the cost of stasis. The interior contradiction—yearning to guide while refusing motion—drives every micro-choice (humming, reading birds, withholding eye-contact). The new pilgrim’s arrival tests her endurance and forces the inheritance gesture, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Only the traveler’s voice remains generic, blunting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dust, echo, and bird-flight thickens until the final cadence reweights stillness itself as the decisive change. Orientation is immediate: highest bone tower, dawn, cross-legged woman. Closure—”stop climbing forever”—crystallizes options with undeniable cost; the arrowhead’s transfer is the visible price. No causal breaks; even the wanderer’s arrival is earned by song-echo mechanics seeded early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers, dust strata, and harmonic canyon act as living instruments that literally amplify choice; the arrowhead’s micro-setting constrains the final hand-off. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—Vessa notices vibration, wind memory, wing angles, never visual tourist catalog. The environment’s acoustic physics are learned through action, not dumped. Final image—the tower humming approval—fuses setting and closure into one charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Vessa maintain her motionless vigil or relent? Pressure tightens when the wandering pulse appears, forcing her to expend her hoarded voice to guide the lost. The cost is immediate: decades of silence broken, dust cracked, succession triggered. One meaningful deepening suffices; the stakes remain visceral because the tower’s height literalizes every bodily risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of pilgrimage: the summit is not reached by arriving but by refusing to leave. The arrowhead’s transformation from weapon to wisdom reweights violence into stewardship without a stated moral. Final image reconfigures the reader’s sense of navigation—stillness as the ultimate journey. No abstract thesis; meaning resides in the harmonic accumulation of echo, dust, and bone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Lyrical, incantatory third-person hovers at mythic distance yet stays tethered to Vessa’s perceptual signature—she feels sound, reads spirals, measures time by dust thickness. Patterned repetition (“echoes of echoes”) teaches the cadence early and pays off in the closing chorus. No head-hopping; traveler’s single line is filtered through canyon reverb, preserving distance. Syntax mirrors geological layering—long sedimentary sentences broken by staccato bird turns.</comment>

<question>7</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Zero scaffold loops; every sentence carries dual duty (atmosphere + causality). Figurative language is sparse, geologic, and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Information density peaks in the humming cascade paragraph where echo mechanics are taught in three lines. Final line’s imperative rhythm (“Then climb… stop climbing forever”) propels closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.9</question><comment>Fresh inversion of the mountain-as-journey trope: the summit is a prison and a classroom. Bone towers carved by sound, not water, create a non-obvious physics that feels inevitable in hindsight. Arrowhead-to-wisdom transformation avoids weapon-as-redemption cliché by embedding it in centuries of dust. Risk-taking—static protagonist, vertical setting—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
