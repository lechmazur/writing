<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Competent interiority—Mira’s fingertip mapping and shard warmth anchor her motives. The final stride into the rift feels earned because every beat ties the glass filter to maternal absence. Yet the emotional paradox (stoic scientist-mother yet sentimental keepsake) isn’t embodied in gesture before the flashback; we get summary instead of contradiction under pressure. Still, the micro-choice to chronicle safe routes shows a visible cost in inherited toxicity, meeting the 9+ quick test for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard glow → locates mother’s footprint → flashback reveals filter purpose → Mira chooses continuation. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“anchor...as she learned to fly”—a Resonant Reconfiguration under Causal lens. No prop teleport or knowledge cheats. One minor softness: the mother’s two-decade-earlier timeline isn’t signaled until inside the vision; a quick cue would lock causality earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shuttle hull rust, dying emergency lights, coffee-cup lipstick—the selected images evoke an inter-dimensional graveyard while guiding Mira toward the coupling unit. Spatial choreography stays clean: palm-to-hull → floor → coupling → rift entry. The bay’s obsolescence mirrors her orphaned urgency, and the green shard’s glow physically charges the final image. Environment thus constrains choice and closure, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find why mother left—signalled early. Escalation: shard warmth intensifies → glimpse of mother’s sacrifice → toxic exposure stakes become personal. One decisive tightening when Mira realizes the filter is “protection against invisible poison,” narrowing her options to continuation. Cost is conceptual but legible; persistent constraint of toxicity shapes her new cartographer mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited responsibility emerges through the glass shard rather than assertion. Subtext in “cathedral to obsolescence” quietly reframes abandonment as devotion. Final image of “anchor...fly” offers non-literal repricing of the parent-child bond. No moralizing statement; complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to sensory data, e.g., “texture of forgotten journeys seep into her fingertips.” Syntax tightens under surge—“Reality split along invisible fault lines.” No head-hop; only Mira’s perception. Dialogue brief, natural: military man interrupts with bureaucratic bluntness, contrasting mother’s diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: “quantum stabilizers had failed here first, creating pockets where time folded” does world-building in one stroke. Rhythm varies—short sentence “The shard pulsed green” propels the turn. Metaphors consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected: “abandoned...neither fully abandoned nor entirely forgotten” could compress. Otherwise clean, no scaffolds in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Multiverse travel is common, but reframing it through tactile cartography of surfaces feels fresh. Green crystal as anti-toxic filter is a novel add. Maternal sacrifice angle isn’t new, yet pairing it with occupational sensory mapping gives specific inflection. Risk taken with accumulative flashback shard; payoff lands. Could edge higher if toxic mechanics were more than assertive.</comment>
