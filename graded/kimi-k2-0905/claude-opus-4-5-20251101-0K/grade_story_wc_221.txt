<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her temporal-patient fingers, the way she counts heartbeats in slow motion—yet her contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in a single beat. The final stance (keep sketching, greet the ship on her own terms) is credible, but the cost is more declared (“solitude had never been punishment”) than dramatized in the moment. Still, the immunity mutation, the family custom, and her quiet refusal to flee cohere into a believable, flawed endurance. A hairline slip from exemplary: we feel her choice, but we don’t quite feel the full ache of the path foregone.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira presses the compass rose back onto the journal, renouncing rescue-as-salvation while the ship still inches across the glass. The cost is legible—“true north was never a fixed destination” now means solitary continuance—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each yearly sketch tightens the pattern until the final image reweights solitude as chosen exploration. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One tiny hairline: the shutdown’s exact timeline is back-loaded, but it never perturbs causality.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observation deck functions as micro-setting: the warped glass, the spider-silk temporal field, and the compass rose itself constrain every action—how slowly Mira moves, how the star positions diverge from ground truth. Sensory selection is biased to her astronomer’s eye: light that “hangs like honey,” footsteps that echo in elongated corridors. The deck’s physics never contradicts itself; even the approaching ship obeys dilated time. Gate met: the tool (compass rose) literally charges the final image as she smoothhes it onto the cover.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn exile into meaningful exploration—tightens when the arriving ship offers rescue, forcing Mira to choose between reunion and continued documentation. The tightening is single but meaningful: sketch first, greet second. Under Accumulative lens, pressure rises through the density of recorded nights rather than causal reversals; the cost is the perpetual slow solitude she elects to keep. No coincidence resolves the moment; the ship merely externalizes the choice she has already made. Visible price: she finishes the anniversary sketch before acknowledging the ship, forfeiting immediate rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: documentation as self-navigation, solitude as chosen vector rather than curse. The compass rose motif reprises at the exact moment Mira redefines “true north,” reweighting family heirloom into personal mandate. No moralizing, only the concrete aftereffect of graphite on paper and gold leaf under starlight. Subtext lives in gesture: smoothing the cracked applique equals accepting cracked isolation. Complexity acknowledged—she still longs, still smiles—yet the story refuses to pity her.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Mira’s slowed perceptions; no head-hopping. Syntax elongates subtly—“each beat a sustained drumroll”—mirroring temporal stretch without overwriting. Diction stays within her scientist-poet lexicon: “stellar movements visible only to someone blessed and cursed.” No dialogue, so voice carries all; the prose breathes at climax when single-sentence paragraphs mimic the slow pulse of her heart. A hairline slip into lyric repetition (“silence echoed around her”) but it is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers physical action, emotional charge, and world rule (“She pulled out her worn journal, its pages filled with hundreds of star maps drawn in careful graphite”). No scaffold loops; metaphors are consistent (taffy, spider silk, honey). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dilated time, staccato for the heartbeat moment. One minor register drift—“temporal-patient fingers” is vivid but momentarily self-conscious; does not obscure closure. Proofing clean; pronoun track perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The temporal-sickness / immunity premise is familiar SF territory, yet the fusion with family star-sketching ritual feels freshly specific: no other story would bind a gilded sewing applique to relativistic astronomy. The risk—quiet ending, no antagonist—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Detail particularity: cracked gold leaf, graphite on warped glass, heartbeat counted in slow motion. Transformation test: swap names and the ritual/physics collapse; the piece is inseparable from its stitched compass rose and dilated deck. Bold yet controlled.</comment>
