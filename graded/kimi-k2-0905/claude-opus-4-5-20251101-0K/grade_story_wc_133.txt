<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia and compulsive painting are vividly embodied; the barefoot walk across the causeway crystallizes her need. Internal contradiction—yearning for meaning while doubting its existence—stays active in scene. The final choice to share work with Theo costs her solitary ritual, yet the beat is slightly under-dramatized; we see the offer, not the relinquishment. Still, motives remain particular and consistent, earning the shift from isolation to witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joined walk and shared amber light reweight Mira’s sleeplessness from punishment to purpose, cost legible in “for the first time… witness.” Causal chain—rain trails → causeway → museum → exchange—holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: Theo’s appearance is pure coincidence, but the piece lets coincidence complicate, not resolve, so lens remains situational and intact.</comment>

<comment>Salt-crusted walls, diagonal rain sheets, and the tide-warmed stones are filtered through Mira’s painterly attention, constraining her decision to cross. The museum’s intact case and pooled rainwater literally point the way, integrating setting into plot. Micro-setting—her paint-stained fingers, the seaweed veils—carries emotional charge without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is flawless; we never lose track of body, object, or distance.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from endless wakefulness—tightens when the rain trails offer a one-way invitation; refusal equals stasis, crossing risks the only ritual she has. The amber brooch discovery escalates by reframing her insomnia as necessary vigilance, not pathology. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; cost is felt in the final image’s “amber light spilling from their joined hands,” converting private obsession into shared witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through tidal imagery: revelation and concealment as the only reliable rhythm after catastrophe. No character moralizes; the brooch’s placard is the closest to exposition, yet it’s diegetic and brief. Final painting crystallizes the thematic answer—meaning is not extracted but transmitted across the exposed spine of land. Ambiguity remains: convergence offers no transcendence, only fellowship in exhaustion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mira’s perceptual filter: rain trails as compositional vectors, warmth of stones as bodily thought. Syntax lengthens under fatigue—“the haggard awe she felt watching civilization’s bones emerge”—then tightens at the encounter. No head-hopping; Theo’s voice is external and distinct, his diction weathered. Compression like “water wars had ended the old world” is taught by context and pays off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “glistening like a spine emerging from grey flesh” does double sensory and symbolic work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. One mixed metaphor—“bruise of stone and ruin”—but it’s brief and early, not near closure. Rhythm modulates with tide and breath, propelling the walk without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic insomnia-artist trope is refreshed by the convergence geology and the rain-trail divination system. Amber brooch as fossilized alignment marker feels specific, not grafted. Risk is taken in quiet, near-static climax—no lantern relit, no battle—yet it commits fully to that quietude. Could edge higher if the world rule for “convergence” were slightly more concrete, but the piece stakes its resonance on mystery and follows through.</comment>
