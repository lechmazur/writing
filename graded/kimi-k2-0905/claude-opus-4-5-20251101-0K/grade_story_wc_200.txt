<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—centuries of duty versus her own identity erosion—are kept alive in every beat; the moment she touches the harp, memory and self-doubt collide in one concrete micro-choice. Her body registers cost (tears, the warming tooth) rather than diagnostic labels. The only bar to 9.0 is that the final self-reconciliation is slightly foreshadow-light; we see the ache but not a prior explicit scene where she doubts her laughter-bridge method.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: slack harp strings tighten the pattern of forgotten laughter-memories that avalanche back in distorted chords, reweighting her purpose. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the ache remained, but now it glowed” crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation anchor (“who/where/when”) arrives by line 3; no ambiguity. Cost is irrefutable—she leaves the gorge transformed, carrying a changed internal temperature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Environment-as-tool: the gorge’s echo throat literally multiplies voices, twisting them into the spectral confessions that force her epiphany. Sound (footfalls thrown back) replaces visual catalog. Bone-white harp-wood fuses setting and object in one image. Micro-setting gate satisfied; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Single dominant stake—recover lost self—signaled in para 1. Tightening occurs when the harp’s first crooked note narrows possibility to “listen or flee”; she pays with emotional exposure as spirits strip away forgetting. Under Accumulative lens, each discordant confession intensifies density rather than causal reversals, sufficient for this length. Cost is legible: she exits with restored purpose yet an enduring, glowing ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: every soul carries “gratitude tangled with grief,” proving laughter is the membrane between worlds. No moralizing; final line offers luminous ache as non-verbal answer. Subtext lives in gesture—touching the tooth after each revelation—rather than explanation. Complexity acknowledged: joy is “companion” to sorrow, not conqueror.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly sewn to Maren’s perceptions; diction (“opaque as river fog,” “wheezed genuine delight”) is specific to her melancholy humor. No head-hopping. Rhythm swells with harp note, then fractures into shorter clauses under spirit voices—intentional modulation. Lyric elision (centuries summarized in two lines) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Information-dense: single sentences deliver backstory (“three centuries”) and present action (“descended…illuminating nothing so much as her own uncertainty”). Metaphors sustain sonic motif—notes “slide like water finding cracks”—without crowding. Zero scaffold/loops; pronoun and tense immaculate. Final clause “the ache glowed” reframes prior metaphor without contradiction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: afterlife bureaucrat meets micro-Pygmalion myth inside a gorge that functions as resonance chamber. Harp misalignment as reality-warp is taught early, not last-minute rule patch. Specificity lifts trope: “crocodile tooth from Nile delta” rather than generic amulet. Risk—lyric ellipsis of centuries—pays off when pattern coheres.</comment>
