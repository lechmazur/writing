<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Eleanor’s inherited mission and scarf-tugging tic are vivid, but she is the only on-page actor; the “patrons” are static furniture. Interiority is rich yet stays reactive—no hard choice until the final step into hyper-space, so the renunciation is felt yet thinly earned. Micro-choices (walking, touching scarf) repeat rather than escalate, limiting contradiction-in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions, wax cylinders humming, spatial “wrongness” deepen the stake until the garden-sky room lands as Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 50; no drift. Closure beat—“began writing in her grandmother’s notebook”—makes conceptual cost legible, though persistent constraint (what she forfeits) is only faintly implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Tiny library objects (wax grooved sonnets, punch-card moths) act as micro-setting that literally bends space; scarf weave doubles as map—both charge the final image. Sensory triage favors smell and haptic vibration, narrowing under Eleanor’s bias. Spatial choreography stays clean through impossible geometry shift because Eleanor’s perceptual drift cues the reader.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the literal home of stories—signaled in para 3; pressure mounts via pattern density (analog memories awakening) rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the aisle that “shouldn’t have existed” forces the step into hyperbolic garden. Cost is conceptual (she now shoulders uncatalogable duty) but not viscerally felt on-page, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from motif cluster: odd hours, obsolete media, geometry of memory—no explicit thesis. Final image of writing in grandmother’s notebook reweights solitude from isolation to vocation. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what “stories living” means, inviting reread. Could climb higher if emotional cost were sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight clings to Eleanor’s perceptual filter: “she felt in her teeth,” “smelled faintly of machine oil.” Rhythm swells with anaphora and catalog listings that mimic archival excess. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on syntax; occasional adjective stacks (“private universe of understanding”) flirt with overwriting but serve accumulative cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high-density lines (“poems existed not as printed words but as grooves pressed into wax cylinders”). One paraphrase loop: “she stayed because…she stayed” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no artifacts touch closure. Slight upgrade for tactile specificity that advances story while evoking atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Scientific poetry stored on obsolete media, accessible only via non-Euclidean library aisles—fresh synthesis. Hyperbolic geometry as emotional topology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to dramatize abstract mathematical space paid off by grounding it in textile map (scarf) and sonic artifacts. Conceptual integrity maintained; no retreat into metaphoric safety.</comment>
