<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elena’s interiority is precise and profession-specific—her locksmith’s habit of "understanding mechanisms" and "filing by candlelight" grounds every beat. The contradiction between her need to explain and her vow "never to explain it away" is held in tension but never dramatized in a single forced choice; the ending is memory rather than renunciation, so the cost is felt but not foregrounded. Emotions stay embodied (trembling hands, heart-as-metronome) and avoid label-speak. The absence of another on-page character keeps status and relationship crucibles inactive; the score caps just under the 9+ gate because the final stance is crystallized but not tested against an external pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the timer expires, the marble sings, Elena records the harvest—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of her available wonder. Causality is intact: every gear she files and angle she maps feeds the final alignment of light, stone, and sound. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of observation and pattern-break of the first audible harvest carry the stakes. Cost is legible in the "returning silence" and the notebook of transcriptions that will forever separate her from pure mystery; no slips touch the ending image.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic geometry constrains every tactical decision—where she stands, how she angles the brass face, when the voices can separate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s trade—she notices resonance frequencies and crystalline cleavage planes before temperature or scent. Spatial choreography is flawless; the timer’s reflections "multiply through the marble chamber" and we track the exact path of light required for harvest. Micro-setting bonus: the mainspring’s tension is measured "against the beat of her own patient heart," charging the final image with embodied tool-as-setting.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—capturing mystery without killing it—is signaled early and tightens through iterative calibration attempts; the harvest moment forces the trade-off between witnessing and recording. Escalation is textural: each failed echo, each filed gear adds density until the pattern-break of the first audible harvest reweights the stake with undeniable cost. No antagonist or external reversal is required; the risk is internal—explain it away—and that risk is not resolved but accepted in the notebook’s existence. The price paid is the silence that returns after the timer stops, foreclosing pure awe.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the central paradox: using mechanical truth to touch the unexplainable. The cellar-of-reason motif (storing wonder for later) recurs as both method and cost, re-weighted when Elena realizes the notebook now mediates every future encounter with mystery. No character states the thesis; insight is earned through tactile struggle with brass and stone. Ambiguity is preserved—she has both preserved and lost the voices—and the reader is left to decide which is the greater deprivation.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, patient, syntactically lathed like the gears Elena files—"the marble cavern breathed with the patience of centuries" sets the cadence and the metaphoric register holds. Perceptual signature is consistent: locksmith first, mystic second—she hears "tumblers fall" where another might hear thunder. Compression is taught early ("autumn first stumbled and fell wounded") and paid off in the final silence that "refused to commit," completing the seasonal motif. No dialogue means no register drift; interior diction stays within the plausible lexicon of a craftsperson who thinks in angles and tensions.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive—long inhalation sentences build to short release clicks ("The timer began its measured countdown"). Information density is high: a single sentence often layers light-path, acoustic law, and emotional stakes. Figurative control is tight—no mixed metaphors, no filler filter verbs. One minor loop check: "preserving the preservation" edges toward paraphrase but is saved by its reflexive charge; it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of locksmith precision with acoustic necromancy is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; the premise transforms two tired tropes into a fresh mechanism. Risk—the entire story is a quiet, solo, procedural meditation—pays off because the final harvest auditory event is rendered as explosive wonder inside immaculate silence. Specificity of detail (filing a replacement gear by candlelight, mapping reflection angles across weeks) makes the concept un-portable; change one detail and the whole machine stalls. Bold refusal of conventional antagonism or dialogue heightens rather than obscures stakes, earning the +0.3 risk bonus within band.</comment>
