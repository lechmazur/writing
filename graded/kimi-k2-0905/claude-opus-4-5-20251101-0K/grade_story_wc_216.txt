<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is concrete and particular—her borrowed years felt as “sediment layers” on her palm. The contradiction between wanting understanding rather than life is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the fragment, sealing the capsule). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts her remaining years as “essential,” foreclosing any return to ordinary mortality. Minor slip: “texture of time” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once, but is immediately embodied again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule seals, Vera’s role flips from borrowed to essential, and the cost is the irrevocable commitment of her remaining years. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each garage-sale listing adds density until the pattern snaps into purpose. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within 50 words. No lens ambiguity; final image reweights premise (“time collects like dust on forgotten shelves”) with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s glass walls catch light to make “seconds visible as shimmering green waves”—a micro-setting that constrains perception and finally charges the sealing image. The capsule and urn fragment function as tactile tools whose cracks and textures guide Vera’s choices. Spatial choreography is immaculate: fragment moves from palm to seal, light shifts as holograms project. One notch down because exterior weather/environment never press back, but interior objects satisfy the micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Elena’s method before her own time expires—signaled early. Tightening occurs when Vera realizes the listings are temporal coordinates; this deepens her mission and forecloses passive cataloging. Cost is visible: she trades her remaining years for continuous encoding labor. Agency is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; no external antagonist needed. Sufficient for length, though a second tightening beat would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: how ordinary commerce can secretly archive human moments. No meta commentary—insight arises from Vera’s tactile reconstruction of the listings. Final image (“time collects like dust…”) offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior garage-sale line. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who will rediscover these moments. Minor deduction for “texture of time” phrase echoing prompt language, but subtext quickly re-localizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Vera notices temporal decay as weight, light sediment, radio frequencies of childhood kitchens. Syntax stays spare, scientific, matching a timekeeper’s precision. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight. Compression (“green light as shimmering green waves”) is taught early and paid off at capsule sealing. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence issue. One register wobble—“emotional archaeology” drifts academic—but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “garage sale item descriptions, hundreds of them, scrolling in pale blue light” compresses world-rule and exposition in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for wonder, clipped fragments when capsule cracks. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and final lines are image-driven, propulsive. Proofing clean; only nit a repeated “the” in “the particular silence” but does not cloud causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—numbers now mean emotions—reshapes familiar time-travel into emotional archaeology. Garage-sale listings as steganographic time-capsules is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky choice to end on quiet dust image rather than spectacle pays off: conceptual cost feels larger. Transformation test passes: swapping “letters” or “diaries” for listings would collapse logic. One hairline slip: “Numerical Reformation” leans toward prompt-template diction, but immediate grounding in Vera’s work saves it.</comment>
