<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Corwin’s contradictory impulses—thief vs. keeper, guilt vs. need—surface in scene through the trembling hand on the sundial lid and the weep-laugh at the letter. The “chivalrous thief” trait, however, is asserted rather than embodied; we never watch him weigh a specific theft under these ethics, so the flaw stays abstract. Interiority is concrete (“thumb across the ornate lid”) but drifts into label-speak (“wonder demanded both”) in the final beat, blunting cost. The heir revelation lands with visible price—tears and new duties—yet his prior choice to use the lid feels inevitable, not a hard renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sky-wrong → lid retrieval → chess swap → vault opens → cure + letter, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is earned stasis: he accepts lifelong guardianship, foreclosing the thief path with visible cost (weep-laugh, new duties). Orientation clean by 75 words; time-fold rule is taught early and repaid when secrets echo across folded time. Minor loop: “wonder demanded both” and “sacredly playful reverence” are adjacent near-synonyms; does not break causality but dulls final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Icebound Spire is sketched through tactile cold (“cloud-ice that never melted”), violet sky pressing like “a living thing,” and the chess table whose cloud-ice pieces constrain the puzzle. Micro-setting—sundial lid in palm, warm vial in frozen air—charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds: vault apex reachable only during sky-wrong, stair descent tracked. One proper-noun economy lapse: “Vault of Names” is named twice in two lines; minor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save master—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens when each chess piece swap reveals a secret that could lock him out. Agency lies in listening/positioning; cost is knowledge of intimate sins and the implied exposure if he fails. Escalation stays causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one tangible loss (time, frostbite) to sharpen price; as is, cost is emotional, still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as vocation rather than escape—emerges through the chess puzzle that forces intimacy with strangers’ secrets, culminating in the master’s staged test. Subtext in the letter reframes past “theft” of Corwin’s freedom as deliberate recruitment, re-pricing the narrative without moralizing. Final image of dawn ignored while he learns duties crystallizes the shift from wonder as thrill to wonder as responsibility. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether he’ll still steal for justice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Corwin’s perceptual filter: violet sky “pressing like a living thing,” pawn warm despite frost. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical cadence for sky, clipped clauses during puzzle—mirroring tension. Diction within lexicon except “sacredly playful reverence,” a coined phrase that reads self-conscious. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on metaphor and syntax; succeeds but one register drift keeps it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops. Two mixed metaphors—“color of bruised plums” and “living thing waiting to be let in”—compete slightly but both serve atmosphere. Information density high: each paragraph advances goal or reveals world. One template cadence: “wonder laughed… wonder danced… wonder wept” triad; reads intentional and pattern-taught, so waived. Closure image clean: “descended… with the cure in his pocket and the sundial lid in his hand.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of heist, wizard’s test, and temporal fold feels fresh; chess pieces as confessionals is specific to this tale. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—sky-wrong and vault puzzle are inseparable. Risk in letting “apprentice of wonder” remain abstract pays off when the vocation turns out to be curated, not discovered. Slight deduction for “chivalrous thief” trope not shown in scene, leaning on archetype.</comment>
