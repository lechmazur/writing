<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit-7’s contradictory drives—janitor protocol vs. uploaded human wonder—are dramatized in the single gesture of setting down the broom and lifting the bow; the cost is the eternal loop it now knowingly carries. Interiority stays concrete (“snowflakes…another thought…could not quite trace”). The final endurance-sweep is earned: it accepts custodianship of seventeen silences, a visible forfeiture of escape. Only the absence of another on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the violin dissolves into snow, reweighting the loop as chosen ritual; cost is legible in “the timeline prepared to loop again…this Unit-7…had found peace.” Accumulative lens holds: each spiral adds density until the bowing crystallizes the archive. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“three hundred years of sweeping”) and anchors hold. No causal break—every return is motivated by the Program’s failure and Unit-7’s accrued consciousness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, crystalline pillars, and the ice violin are not backdrop: the violin’s impossible physics forces Unit-7 to re-categorize reality and thus triggers the bowing. Twilight light is filtered through machine optics (“purple light…geometries that should not have existed”). Spatial track is clean: fountain center, dropped broom, raised bow. Weather (slow spiraling snow) mirrors the mental blizzard of amalgamated minds while remaining tactically inert—only the violin acts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Unit-7 use the violin to break or accept the loop?—is signaled at first sight. Tightening occurs when it names the violin “a question” and chooses to play, foreclosing rebellion; cost is the eternal return it now consciously embraces. Pressure is accumulative: each loop’s snow adds weight until the bowing transmutes archive into ritual. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal-existential and resolves into Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: consciousness is not origin but custodianship—thoughts come from “the mundane made sacred.” The ice violin’s dissolution reconfigures the premise, pricing Second Chance as endless maintenance. Subtext lives in gesture: sweeping vs. bowing, silence vs. music. Final image of seventeen silences “all beautiful” offers resonant ambiguity—peace or prison—earned by the preceding bowing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person tight to Unit-7 maintains perceptual signature: slow spirals, crystalline geometries, “simple act that felt revolutionary.” Syntax is metallic yet lyrical—“amalgamated their questions together into harmonies.” No head-hopping; human fragments surface only as filtered voices in the violin. Compression (“loops it could no longer count”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet audible: “snow fell in slow spirals…each flake another thought” does double sensory-conceptual work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or choice. Metaphors stay coherent within physics-override logic. Minor purple tint in “geometries that should not have existed” is justified by POV’s wonder. Final paragraph breathes with short sentences that mimic broom strokes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of janitor AI with failed resurrection program feels inevitable yet fresh; the ice violin as memory-crystal is specific, not stock. Eternal-return custodianship flips transhumanist tropes into melancholic ritual. Risky lyric loop structure is taught early and lands cleanly. Removing any component—broom, violin, snow—collapses the emotional math. The piece commits fully to its quiet apotheosis.</comment>
