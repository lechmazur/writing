<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is rich and character-specific, her scientific detachment colliding with maternal guilt in real time. The jade cicada acts as a tangible pressure point that forces her to articulate a flaw she has never voiced. Elena's micro-shift from accusation to curiosity is credibly understated, not tidy. What keeps this from 9-band is that Elena's final overture—“teach me”—is slightly too neat a crystallization given the decades of damage; the cost is felt but not yet paid on her side.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“time moved like the tides”) and held: every tidal image adds density until the final “space between heartbeats” reweights the stake. The grotto’s starlight and pools serve as repeating texture that makes the final silence legible as Charged Poise. Closure lands with conceptual cost: Mira’s life-work insight is exactly what she must trade for her daughter. The slight deduction is for a single causal elision—how Elena’s “teach me” emerges from silence is not micro-motivated beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The grotto is not backdrop but instrument: tidal pools mirror possible reconciliations and the star-ceiling forces whispered intimacy. Mineral flecks and salt-spray keep sensory selection biased toward Mira’s chronicler gaze. Spatial choreography is flawless—both women remain seated, object between them, daughter’s foot near a pool that flickers at the exact emotional flicker. The only barrier to 9 is that the grotto’s texture never literally constrains their next move; it hovers as ambience rather than tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>8.6</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—can this conversation restart relationship after the father’s death—is signaled in Elena’s first line and tightens each time Mira dodges. The meaningful intensifier is the cicada hand-off: it shrinks abstraction into a physical test of forgiveness. Cost is visible: Mira openly confesses her life’s confusion, foreclosing her expert stance. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but under the Accumulative lens the repeated tidal imagery makes silence heavier each paragraph until speech becomes the only narrower option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—time as felt texture versus measured quantity—emerges entirely through concrete particulars: cicada life-cycle, mineral starlight, pause-length of grief. Subtext lives in gesture: Elena’s toe near the pool, her finger tracing wings. No character states the moral; the final image of “healing…between heartbeats” is Conceptual Repricing that reweights every earlier pool. The line “I had confused studying transitions with living through them” risks thematic echo but is saved by its placement mid-story and by Mira’s immediate flinch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The free-indirect voice carries Mira’s chronicler diction—“liminal spaces,” “multitudes”—without spilling into jargon; syntax lengthens and contracts like tides, mirroring her subject. Elena’s two spoken lines are shorter, adolescent, a clean contrast. No filter-verb clusters; perceptual signature is sharp—Mira notices salinity, mineral gleam, not touristic stalactites. Under peak pressure the prose compresses to fragments (“Between your question and my answer”) then widens, a deliberate rhythm that teaches its pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor in one stroke; final line resolves by image. Figurative language is sparse, tide-metaphor returning only when it can accrue new emotional density. High information density: thirty years of backstory compressed into two concrete clauses without synopsis drag. Proofing is clean; pronoun reference never drifts across mother/daughter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The chronicler-as-mother premise feels inevitable yet fresh; transition as biological field-work braided with filial repair is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken by making the climax an unanswered question followed by a metaphoric object transfer—quiet, but the pattern is taught early and closure is legible. Avoids quirky ornament; tide-pool specifics are earned, not imported for color. Only the daughter’s final request feels slightly familiar, preventing a higher band.</comment>
