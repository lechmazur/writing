<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elena’s map-framer eye and methodical curiosity are credibly anchored in micro-actions (comparing footage, touching the tear), but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the final beat is observation plus typing, not renunciation or risk. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“she had learned…”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under threat. The absence of a second on-page character keeps status pressure off the page, so the crucible is purely cognitive; that limits the depth of flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chapel “begins to whisper” reweights all prior silence and stakes the decision to recommend opening or sealing—cost is the unspoken responsibility Elena now carries. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain/time erosion → pigment loss → map tear → perceptual shift → final poised stance. One scaffold line (“she had come here to interpret silence with empathy”) states motive already shown; otherwise no plot breaks. Orientation is clean by 120 words; transitions are smooth within the single-scene default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vault’s damp stone, flaking saints, and the literal tear in the map are viscerally tactile and steer Elena’s attention; the henge stones act as micro-setting that reconfigures from blank to grieving faces, directly charging the final image. Weather (rain) is not mere backdrop—it is the causal agent eroding pigment and threading the 300-year timeline. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the laptop’s blue glow and mold crate root us in one continuous location. Environment constrains choice: she cannot touch the tear yet reads it as boundary, informing her poised report.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to give the chapel voice or leave it sealed—emerges early and tightens when the map tear proves the space is actively changing under observation. The single meaningful deepening occurs as Elena registers expressive stone faces: unknown territory is now literally reacting to her gaze, foreclosing the option of neutrality. Agency is intellectual (comparing footage, typing the report) rather than physical risk, so cost is conceptual but still legible. No reversals or external antagonist are needed under Accumulative lens; pressure accrues through pattern break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated boundaries—on maps, in silence, between known and unknown—emerges through the tearing map image rather than authorial statement. Subtext operates in the shift from “whispered chapel” (rumored) to actual whisper at dawn, implying language reclaimed from abandonment. Ambiguity is purposeful: the saints’ turning heads remain unconfirmed, so theme resists tidy supernatural or natural verdict. Final image reweights earlier blank-space cartography without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Elena’s perceptual filters: damp stone, mold smell, grainy footage comparisons. Syntax is rhythmic yet controlled—“patient as prayer,” “forgotten intentions”—without purple overload. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits in narrator summary, not Elena’s interior, so distance remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong sentence variety and sensory density; no filter-verb clusters or scaffold loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“rain had been working…” sustains single vehicle. One paraphrase loop: “never been consecrated, never held a congregation, never known anything but silence” reads deliberate litany rather than accidental padding. Otherwise information-dense and propulsive to the whisper close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival footage comparison with gothic erosion freshens both tropes; the haunted chapel is familiar, but the map-framer’s forensic gaze gives it new instrumentation. Risk is moderate—quiet accretion instead of spectacle—yet specificity ( pigment loss geometry, stone expression timeline) makes the synthesis feel particular rather than catalog exercise. Could edge higher with a sharper personal cost to Elena.</comment>
