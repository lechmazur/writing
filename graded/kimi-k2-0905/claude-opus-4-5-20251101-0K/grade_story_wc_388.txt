<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya’s “drive to excavate truth” is stated early and repeatedly, but we see only one embodied micro-choice—unwrapping the diamond. The interior contradiction between skeptic and believer is asserted, never dramatized in-scene; the emotional turn is summarized (“something cold settled in her chest”) rather than lived. Her decision to leave with the diamond feels inevitable, not costly, because the text has not shown her weighing any live alternative. Competent, but the absence of a visible, fork-in-the-road moment keeps her just shy of 8-band interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: orchard survival → shredded letters → stillpoint → diamond → departure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; the orchard’s impossibility is the inciting image. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she exits the safe stillpoint to broadcast proof—paid off in the final line “watch what grew.” One causality hiccup: the Geiger counter “falling silent” is told, not shown as a sensory beat, slightly dulling the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is rendered through selective, urgent sense—respirator hiss, mutant fruit colors that “had no names,” Geiger stutter/quiet. These details are filtered by Maya’s investigator eye and directly enable her deduction beats. The stillpoint itself is micro-setting as charged object: its “strange absence of radiation” is felt in her bones, guiding the final unwrapping. Meets the 9-band gate by constraining her tactics and charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the Consortium’s lie—arrives late (middle of page 2) but immediately tightens when the diamond’s “key” function narrows her options to flee or hide. Escalation is single, meaningful: knowledge that reclamation is possible raises the personal risk of smuggling proof. Cost is present but soft: intangible danger “out there” rather than a concrete constraint on this scene. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a palpable on-page price (injury, forfeited tool, live pursuer) that would push it into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: biological mutation as metaphor for informational mutation—truth blossoming from irradiated lies. The glowing apples reappear at exit, reweighted from grotesque to generative, supplying a Conceptual Repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext stays in image (Geiger silence = censored truth) rather than editorial. Final line “watch what grew” hands the parable to the reader without thesis statement, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains tight to Maya’s investigator diction: “counting mutations,” “ink consistencies,” “paper grain.” Rhythm compresses under storm pressure—short clauses mimic respirator cadence. No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is nil. Occasional elevated phrases (“grotesque abundance,” “conceptual repricing”) drift toward editorial, but they largely stay anchored in her analytical mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong propulsion—every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Only minor loops: “comfortable lie” is repeated twice with identical phrasing; “something cold settled…” is generic embodiment. Mixed metaphor “roots drinking deep from contaminated soil” is vivid and purposeful, not muddled. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered, sentence-varied—no artifacts touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Chernobyl-esque wasteland with alchemical stillpoint feels fresh, and the diamond-as-resonator is a specific, non-obvious pivot. Mutated apple hues that “had no names” is a precise sensory invention. The Consortium trope is familiar, yet the reversal—purification meant to hide regeneration—re-energizes it. Risky structural compression (700-word planetary stakes) pays off without slack, earning the upper-band nod.</comment>
