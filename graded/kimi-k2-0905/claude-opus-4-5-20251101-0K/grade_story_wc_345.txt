<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“strangely trustworthy, this dead man” shows a layered, contradictory stance toward the ghost—but her moment of kneeling to chalk “Thank you. You could join us” is the only micro-choice that alters the relationship. The ghost’s motives remain reported, not dramatized, blunting the crucible effect. Secondary settlers (Marcus, Yuki, Sola) apply pressure via dialogue, yet their arcs are compressed into polite competence. Cost is felt, but the renunciation of solitude is the ghost’s, not Elara’s; her agency plateaus. Overall characterization is strong, but the decisive change is off-stage in the ghost’s silent smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each chalk message layers communal habit until the final exchange crystallizes belonging. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—“I have you. That is enough.”—a quiet renunciation with conceptual cost for the ghost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. Pressure tightens once: the eastern-grove thirst catalyzes cooperative action. No causal reversals are needed; the pattern’s density reweights meaning.</comment>

<comment>The floating rock arches and sideways starfruit branches are not backdrop—they dictate irrigation routes and the colony’s daily choreography. The butterfly-moth pollinators respond only to the bell’s unique tone, so the micro-setting (tool) constrains harvest tactics. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Elara’s dawn-walk priorities: phosphorescent chalk precedes mist and silver bark. Spatial choreography is clean: chalk appears “outside her dwelling,” settlers converge, Elara leaves a reply on the same path. The setting charges the final image: the bell’s chime across the arches is the audible bridge between living and lost.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is communal survival through cooperation; the ghost’s messages tighten that stake into morning ritual. The single meaningful deepening—grove thirst + forgotten lessons—forces collective labor and curriculum reform. Cost is visible: Elara’s borrowed chalk and public gratitude expose her to possible rejection (never comes, but risk is legible). No antagonist is required; pressure accrues from blight risk and memory loss. Escalation is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated acts of tending: orchards, children, memory, even the ghost’s penance. The final chalk line—“I am not alone. I have you.”—reweights “nebula of respite” from refuge to mutual responsibility. Subtext operates in gift-objects: the bell once anonymous now rings the colony’s heartbeat. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the bell’s chime bridging life and after-life. Brambled hope is dramatized, not labeled—thorns are the ever-present arch-fall risk, bloom is the harvest laughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lyric-accumulative, present-tense stable, with controlled psychic distance. Diction—“starfruit from branches that grew sideways into nothing”—is character-specific, not tourist-catalog. Sentence rhythm swells toward the communal dawn, then shortens for the final chalk reply, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue clogs the texture; when Marcus grunts, it’s action-driven. Voice never explains what Elara already knows; bell’s origin is revealed through gift receipt, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense but uncluttered: “fog drifted like breath” is the only adverbial simile in the first 200 words. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds new causal detail (soil check, bell chime, moth descent). Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image—bell chime as heartbeat. Metaphors stay internally consistent; arches cradle, mist breathes, chalk glows—no mixed vehicles. Tense and aspect remain stable across the single dawn-to-dawn window.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The altruistic-ghost trope is refreshed by turning him into infrastructure: chalk messages replace séance, bell replaces haunting. “Nebula of respite” literalizes refugee limbo as orchard planet, avoiding abstract sentiment. Specific detail—sideways branches, twin suns, phosphorescent chalk—prevents generic space-pastoral. Risk is taken: no confrontation, no ghost POV, yet coherence holds. The synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
