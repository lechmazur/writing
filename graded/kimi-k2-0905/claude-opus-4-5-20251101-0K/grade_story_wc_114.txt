<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cassandra’s interior contradiction—certainty vs. probabilistic hedging—drives every beat; the swallowed-apocalypse choice is foreshadowed by her thumb on the smudge and lands with visible cost (“her own private weight”). The grandmother link and final refusal crystallize a hierarchy of values without tidy redemption. Minor slip: “oracle who could be wrong” is concept-stated, not yet embodied, in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, aurora, and smudged lily accrete to reweight silence as weapon. Closure is Charged Poise—Cassandra tucking the imperfect illustration into her coat—where the cost is the burden of unspoken extinction she will now carry alone. No orientation debt; mountain station anchored by word 50. One hairline slip: “she would give them nothing” telegraphs the final refusal a beat early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frost-garden on the window, juniper tea, barometers, and the cot’s narrowness are filtered through Cassandra’s meteorological gaze; each returns to mirror her shifting certainties. The smudged lily micro-setting literally stains her thumb and later charges the final image. Mountain cold constrains her slow rising and reinforces the choice to endure rather than speak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—speak the certain apocalypse or swallow it—tightens once when she decides silence equals liberation; cost is the perpetual internal pressure of that truth. Agency is renunciation rather than action, but the option to report is explicitly foreclosed on-page. Under the accumulative lens, the lack of external escalation is offset by density of imagery that makes silence feel heavier than speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the moral weight of imperfect knowledge vs. perfect complicity. The smudged lily’s shift from “error” to “more real” reweights the entire epistemic frame—truth has mass, but flaw has humanity. No abstract thesis—final image of tucking the flawed flower into her coat offers a wordless moral reconfiguration. Aurora-as-grief simile crystallizes tone-as-theme without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorological metaphors grafted onto emotional states (“hollow as a struck bell,” “weather shifted without warning”). Compression taught early—“an oracle who could be wrong”—and paid off in final refusal. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue stays within Cassandra’s filtered ear. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is justified by Cassandra’s engineered origin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long breathy sentences under fever, then shorter clauses as decision hardens. Information-dense lines (“She predicted storms with seventy percent certainty…”) fold exposition into voice. Zero paraphrase loops; only two near-adjacent “truth” mentions but separated by image. Metaphors stay meteorological and mutually coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: fault-tolerant oracle engineered to be gracefully wrong—turns the trope of prophecy into a moral choice about silence. Smudged botanical illustration as both heirloom and epistemic manifesto is specific to this world. Risk of static lyricism is offset by the final active tucking motion. Conceptual integrity intact: no retreat into generic rebellion.</comment>
