<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is specific—calligrapher turned puppeteer, guilt-tinged pragmatism—and his contradictory impulse (manipulate to enlighten) is active in every beat. Vera’s shift from accusation to tear-streaked request is embodied, not declared. Their joint mark in the dust crystallizes a shared, costly微型 choice under the dome’s echo. Only minor slack: “uncommonly serene” is label-adjacent before it’s dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: argument → silence → puppet show → reversed certainties → dust marks that foreclose old stances. Closure is a Charged Poise: the question mark beside 聽 charges every prior ethical claim with mutual, visible cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Meteor-hush metaphor is earned, not imposed. Cost is legible in the final image—no further exposition needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dome functions as micro-setting: curved echo walls amplify whispers and puppet shadows, forcing intimacy and tactical disclosure. Coastal scrub and surf are sensed, not catalogued. The dust floor becomes writable parchment—tool and terrain at once. Spatial choreography clean; bodies tracked from stairs to concrete to joint inscription.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ethically sideways storytelling survive confrontation with journalistic truth—tightens when Vera demands the show. One visible reversal: puppets turn accusation back on both, foreclosing prior certainties. Cost is emotional abrasion and the shared question mark that locks them into new, uneasy equipoise. Agency remains Marcus’s to perform, Vera’s to witness, both to accept the dust-marked aftermath.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: manipulation vs illumination braided through puppet show and calligraphy dust. Final image reweights “listening” and “question” as non-verbal ethical stance. No tidy moral—ambiguity preserved in the shared smile through tears. Subtext carried in object handling (story stick passed hand to hand) and silence after puppets fall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual sieve—calligraphy muscle memory, puppet-carver’s eye for carved faces. Syntax modulates: longer reflective cadences early, clipped sensory beats during puppet moment. No filter-verb clusters. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Vera’s journalist precision vs Marcus’s aphorist compression. Voice never explains what the dust image already shows.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors (fallen moon, meteor hush) are sparse, precise, paid off by closure. High information density: one line slips brush/ink case into puppet casket without exposition. Zero paraphrase loops; “meteor hush” appears once and resonates. Final line breathes, stops—perfect cadence match to earned poise.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Puppet-show-as-ethical-probe feels fresh; reuse of derelict Cold-War dome as confession booth is specific, not scenic tourism. Synthesis of calligraphy and puppetry disciplines creates non-obvious metaphor cluster. Reversal inside the show reframes journalism vs art without choosing sides. Risk (quiet ending in dust marks) heightens rather than softens stakes.</comment>
