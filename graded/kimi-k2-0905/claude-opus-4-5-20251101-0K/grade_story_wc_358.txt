<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulse—guilt-driven vigilance versus institutional futility—remains embodied in crouched wind readings and pocket-patch pressure; the final vow to “speak second” crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The only bar: no second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets are moot yet interior contradiction is vivid and sustained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: her refusal to quit is foreclosed by the port’s “breathing” labyrinth and the promise to Vasquez’s children; cost is legible in the final image of her walking alone “before the next silence becomes permanent.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of nightly surveys tightens stakes without causal plot reversals. Minor slip: orientation is complete by line 5, well under the 120-word allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container corridors, anemometer dial, and contracting metal function as micro-setting that directly constrain her survey path and safety choices; the flight-patch body-object recurs to charge the final image. Sensory selection—cooling groans, bitter coffee, corrugated walls—filters through investigator POV, guiding tactical attention. Environment is indispensable to both tactic and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the next “singular convergence” death—tightens via escalating wind-speed data (7 → 32 mph) that forecloses the option to stop surveying. Cost is visible: midnight deadline, dismissed reports, solitary risk. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: foresight is paid for with solitary vigilance and probable futility. Final image reweights the premise—her maps will outlive institutional denial—without moralizing. Subtext in wind-as-breathing and patch-as-method avoids abstraction; emotional aftereffect is concrete dread tempered by duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—wind-speed numerics, metal contraction sounds, notebook haze—remains investigator-specific. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during measurement beats, mirroring attention shifts. No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on interior texture, which is coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language (“metal heart,” “city wake”) is sparse and patterned early so closure retains clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift detected. Occasional adjective pairs (“hazy precision”) are voice-motivated and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: treating a container port as a respiring wind instrument whose “notes” are fatal. Premise is grounded in fluid-dynamics specifics rather than disaster cliché. Risk—lyric engineering survey instead of plot twist—heightens meaning without obscuring stakes; transformation would collapse if setting swapped.</comment>
