<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina’s fear-to-armor arc is embodied through the dance-cipher; the final port de bras crystallizes inherited resolve with felt cost. Yet the interior contradiction between terror and precision is told more than dramatized in the underwater beats—no trembling hand slips, no mis-step that might have let seawater erase a page. The dancing decryption is original and specific, but the story keeps her competence too frictionless for full 9-band tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dice click ascent reweights all prior coding, undeniable conceptual cost—stories once encrypted will now surface into uncertain political light. Accumulative lens holds: each danced phrase deepens density until the final image reconfigures stakes. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean; orientation anchors by line 4. No causality breaks, but the missing beat of possible failure keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sunken lab filters every move—sediment “snow,” bloated journals, green-gray light through portholes—constraints tactile and moral. Micro-setting of the dice in pocket and wrist-tattoo symbol act as portable environment that charges final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room. Setting never forces a mis-step, so it supports but does not alone tighten the screw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surface the names without drowning their meaning—signals early. One meaningful deepening: dance reveals love-letter/poetry beneath data, reweighting stakes from intel to human vulnerability. Escalation is accumulative density, not causally narrowed options; no moment where a wrong pirouette could lose the journals. Cost is conceptual, visible in final ascent, but lacks a tangible price paid on-page, holding it below 8.8.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: vulnerability encrypted becomes transmissible strength. Subtext lives in gesture—arabesque as safe-house map—poetry inside inventory. Final image reweights premise: fear not failure, but torch. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about political fallout of disclosure, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Marina’s perceptual filter: spider-web gait, dice letter-against-letter timbre. Syntax lengthens into flowing dance sentences that mimic momentum, then contracts at ascent. No head-hop; diction within cryptographer/dancer lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic signature sustains without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Highly dense lines carry atmosphere, plot, and theme simultaneously; near-zero scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing—“patience of forgotten things,” “encrypted her vulnerability as strength”—flirts with poetic overwrite but stays motivated by lyric mode. No mixed metaphors, no loops; final paragraph breathes without deflating. One paraphrase echo (“fear was not failure” restated) keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Combines WWII crypto-dance, underwater gothic, and inherited trauma in synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of dance-as-decryption paid off through consistent pattern. Dice motif reweights at closure without feeling inserted. Not quite transformative enough to reach 9+ band—remains a resonant chamber piece rather than genre-redefining.</comment>
