<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is concrete—heartbeat-fear as “second heart,” the ash-taste of victory—yet the moment she consumes fear is slightly under-cooked; we are told “it was smaller” rather than shown her corporeal ingestion. Her contradictory impulses (repulsion / complicity with the advisor) play out in live gesture—pin clasped, dictionary tucked—earning the renunciation of fear. The advisor’s shifting face and hunger-tenderness are individuated, but his final motive (“I feed on their corpses”) is delivered as declarative lore, not dramatized pressure. Still, the micro-choice to smile “with borrowed teeth” crystallizes a hierarchy of values—survival through seduction—closing the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drowning → fear nest → advisor’s paradoxical method → dream confrontation → consumption. The opera clasp and dictionary are seeded early and return reweighted: clasp gleams post-victory, mirrors add one more smiling face. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Vera’s chest is emptied but her mouth tastes of ash, the funhouse gains her triumph—so cost is on-page. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Single-scene default met; transition is internal dream logic, taught by the dictionary instruction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The funhouse is not backdrop but tactical arena: mirrors that “captured screams” force fear to witness itself, warped floorboards echo Vera’s heartbeat, cursed glass stores her final smile. Micro-setting objects—opera clasp, dictionary—constrain choices: clasp must be worn, definitions must be read to lure fear. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the single permitted sense (silvered glass light) is thematically apt. Spatial choreography stays clean across the advisor’s doorway apparition and dream-mirror reversal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excise the fear-creature—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: from passive infestation to active seduction that tricks fear into self-witnessing. Agency sits with Vera: she reads, dreams, smiles, consumes. Cost is visible—empty chest, ash mouth, her face now imprisoned in same mirrors—so price alters her ontology. No coincidence resolves; the advisor’s hunger complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges: fear’s power depends on refusal to self-regard; seduction trumps hatred. Subtext carries in the mirrors’ “beautiful agony,” the advisor’s corpse-feeding ecology. Final image reweights premise—funhouse now contains triumph, not just terror—achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo spoken; insight stays implicit in the smiling captured face.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Vera’s perceptual signature—“sound like dead leaves scraping against bone,” “taste of ash and victory.” Sentence rhythm accelerates during dream confrontation, then arrests on the short smiling sentence. No head-hopping; advisor’s voice filters through Vera ears. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a trauma survivor. Filter verbs scarce; immediacy dominates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. High density: “sound like dead leaves scraping against bone” does three jobs—simile, sensory, foreshadowing corpse-feeding. Metaphors stay coherent: mirrors as photographic traps, fear as nested second heart. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. Minor elevation in register during advisor speech is motivation-justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned carnival, dream dictionary, fear-eating entity—are reforged through photographically-cursed mirrors and the paradoxical seduction method. Fresh inflection: fear defeated not by courage but by forced self-spectatorship. Risk in lyrical compression pays off; closure legible. Transformation test fails if relocated—specific mirror-lore and opera clasp are inseparable. No derivative premise penalty; lived detail transforms stock frame.</comment>
