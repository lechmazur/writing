<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—clinging to forgetting while clawing back fluency—are dramatized in every tactile beat; the mercury skin that “retains nothing” yet accepts etched symbols embodies the split. The final ascent is earned: she pays with the literal pain of recovered grief, proving she is “whole enough to hurt.” No label-speak; all interiority is embodied in feather-on-glass sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lost language is not retrieved into mind but inscribed into mercury flesh, a Charged Poise that reweights “home” from place to fluency. Causal linkage holds: each nightly failure (bleeding dawn) forces the tactile workaround that ultimately lets her speak. The persistent constraint—memory loss at sunrise—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image of climbing “mercury and memory.” Cost is legible in the phrase “finally whole enough to hurt.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active archive: shelves grow roots, corridors reconfigure in response to Vera’s re-inscription, turning the setting into a living text that answers back in the tongue she etches. Micro-setting—the feather’s barbs, the stone’s insect-symbols—constrains method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: descent to “deepest level,” ascent to “peak where light still reached.” Environment, body, and tool fuse into one constraint system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering fluency versus bearing the grief it carries—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative design: each dawn erasure raises the cost of retrying. The feather-introduced reversal (language must be walked, not read) narrows options to bodily inscription, foreclosing mental retrieval. Persistent price—sunset amnesia—alters every tactic and is felt again in the closing hurt. One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: language as dwelling, home as iterative self-excavation. The final image of climbing “toward the sky waited to hear what she would say” offers a non-literal answer—fluency is an ongoing conversation with the world’s grief. Subtext operates in the feather’s impossible colors and the bookstore’s shifting corridors, never decoded for the reader. No moralizing; the thematic question is reweighted, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual signature: silver lungs, dust she “breathes,” symbols that “move like insects beneath glass.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses during inscription beats, mirroring the accretive process. No head-hopping; the reflective passages are anchored to present tactile cues. Diction stays within the fabulist register without drifting into pseudo-epic bombast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from incantatory catalogues to clipped inscription beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (language as terrain, mountain as book) returns to reweight closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Copy is clean; pronouns unambiguous despite shifting corridors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mercury-skinned archivist who rewrites herself nightly via untranslatable stone-and-feather is a fresh synthesis; the trope of memory-loss is inverted—forgetting is survival, remembering is penance. Risky accumulative structure pays off: the hundred-night iteration becomes the plot. Specific detail (iridescent feather “shifting colors she had no names for”) prevents abstraction. Conceptual integrity holds: the world never softens its rule that fluency equals grief-bearing.</comment>
