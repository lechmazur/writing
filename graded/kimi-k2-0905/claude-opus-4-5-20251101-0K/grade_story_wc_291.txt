<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clara’s face-blindness is never named yet governs every perception; the contradiction between her inability to recognise faces and her forensic gift is dramatised in each micro-choice (counting stones, mapping bone angles). The final sketch is earned: her refusal to see Marcus as monster costs her the comfort of moral clarity, a renunciation visibly paid. Interiority stays concrete—“granite walls rising like tombstones through the morning mist”—never drifts into label-speak. OnePOV, no other on-page characters, so relationship bullets waived; still, the empathic arc is complete and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon, once mute evidence, becomes a silent accusation that reweights justice outside statute. Causal chain holds: because Clara cannot recognise, therefore she measures; because she measures, she unifies contradictory witness descriptions; because she unifies, Marcus’s face emerges. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Clara descended…”), no debt. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the final line: “She had already seen everything she needed to see”—the quarry keeps its silence, but Clara forfeits the luxury of forgetting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry is not backdrop but tool: the flooded pit mirrors nothing, forcing Clara to rely on her own grid; the mist literally obscures faces, weaponising her blindness. The ribbon is micro-setting that constrains—the faded silk survives while blood and footprints vanish, guiding her pencil. Spatial choreography is flawless: gravel path → quarry floor → eastern ledge → ascent, no impossible positions. Weather evolves with revelation—mist lifts as the face is completed—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><answer>The dominant stake—seeing Elena clearly—tightens once when the unified face emerges; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is knowledge-based: each photograph negates a false binary (monster/saviour), narrowing perceptual options until only Marcus remains. Cost is the empathic burden Clara assumes: she must feel what she cannot recognise. Agency is intellectual yet visceral—her pencil “lance-sharp” carves the human face into the record, foreclosing legal vengeance but opening moral witness.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refrain “truth becomes a matter of architecture”: geometry replaces identity, empathy is built, not felt. Subtext lives in the ribbon—silk that once tied a mask now ties Clara to the victim’s humanity. No moralising line; the final image of the notebook holding Elena’s face reconfigures justice as memory, not punishment. The reader is left weighing whether witness without recognition is enough—an ambiguity earned, not imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, surgical, mirroring Clara’s methodical mind: “lance-sharp”, “catalogued the angle”, “brick by brick”. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Diction remains within an artist’s lexicon—bone structure, shadows, graphite—never drifts into cop-speak. Rhythm accelerates during the sketch, then settles into the final quiet cadence as mist lifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No loops, no synonym churn; each sentence carries dual duty—e.g., “black water reflected nothing but gray sky” paints setting and states her cognitive limit. Metaphors are sparse, coherent: tombstones, architecture, brick—motifs that repay at close. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “furrowed hush”. Proofing clean; no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blindness as investigative super-power, cold-case as memory-art. The quarry’s thirty-year silence turned into an acoustic canvas for empathy. Risky refusal of courtroom payoff pays off—closure is conceptual, yet undeniable. Specific inflection: ribbon colour matching Elena’s mask is not ornamental but the keystone that collapses witness binaries.</comment>
