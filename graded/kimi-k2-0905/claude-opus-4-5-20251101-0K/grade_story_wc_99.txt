<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete—compass warmth, lace tracing—and her contradictory guilt/need is embodied. The micro-choice to point at the apology knot lands with cost: “I was wrong” spoken without words. Grandmother’s trembling answering touch shows genuine struggle under pressure. Voice stays distinct; no therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lace tableau crystallizes reconciliation with felt cost—the years lost cannot be undone. Causal lens holds: because grandmother wove the lace, therefore Mei can now read it; because Mei reads it, therefore silence cracks. Cost is visible in the “raw and relieved” collapse. No orientation drift; timeline anchored by tide post-storm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Islet, mist-wet rocks, cerulean sky, and antique lace all filter through Mei’s attention and guide her choices. The compass as micro-setting constrains direction toward the cottage, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography clean: steps, window, laps traceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking unsaid apology—signals early. One meaningful tightening: the instant Mei decodes the first knot, silence must either break or calcify forever. Agency is hers; the tide’s return externalizes irreversible choice. Price legible: fifty years of regret condensed into one trembling finger touch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the lace itself—language can be re-invented when voice fails. No moralizing; the sky’s deepening cerulean reweights “color of unspoken apologies” without naming it. Subtext in silences, object handling. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: color finally seen, apology finally touched, cost still lived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mei; perceptual signature—“rhythmically placid whisper,” “cerulean regret”—remains hers. Syntax lengthens or breathes with tide rhythm. No head-hops. Dialogue minimal, distinct: Tanaka’s “each syllable unfurling like a careful leaf” mirrors bonsai patience. Filter verbs rare; diction stays within Mei’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: tide, compass, lace, color all carry dual duty. No mixed metaphors; “cerulean regret” stays consistent. Zero loops or scaffold; no “-ly” adverb clusters. Final line lands on image that recharges prior motifs without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lace as bespoke language for aphasia, compass that points toward emotional north. Risk in quiet ending pays off—no speech, yet closure undeniable. Not a template plot; particulars (bonsai tutor, ghost-ship compass) resist swap test. Emotional specificity avoids generic reconciliation arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mr. Tanaka’s slow speech early frames expectation; middle beat—handing over lace—enables Mei’s next tactic; final beat—watching from doorway—adds witnessed cost. His patience mirrors bonsai metaphor, but he alters no tactical choice, capping score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compass appears in pocket, warms on thigh, steers Mei to cottage; needle stilled at closure signals found apology. Cannot swap with generic compass—its supernatural drift is indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“Tides of remembrance” framed in opening, echoed by tide’s literal return at end; metaphorical tide pulls memories back, enabling reconciliation. Not merely decorative—rhythm paces the apology’s arrival.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Rhythmically placid” describes both waves and Mei’s forced calm; the trait enables her to sit still and decode lace under emotional pressure. Without that calm, the silent translation would read implausible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Diffuse is dramatized as Mei spreads lace across laps, letting meaning seep through pattern rather than confront head-on. Action shapes the apology exchange; not easily swapped.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace instructions are backbone: early setup, middle decoding beat, final closure hinge. Removing the woven language collapses entire reconciliation mechanism—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Post-rain islet supplies isolated container; mist and wet rocks mirror emotional rawness. Setting does not constrain tactics heavily, but its quiet removes external noise, making silence potent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>“After the severance” is early signal; three months since stroke gives urgency to break silence now. Timeframe tightens decision—grandmother could die—but lacks ticking clock within scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Color quest is dramatized through sky watch and final cerulean image; desire motivates Mei to decode lace. Desire conflicts with fear that apology may be too late—cost felt in trembling touch.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cerulean regret suffuses sky, compass, and final emotional hue; tone modulates from storm-muted to evening-deepened, mirroring earned sorrow. Tone charges final image with conceptual cost—regret now visible yet unending.</comment>
