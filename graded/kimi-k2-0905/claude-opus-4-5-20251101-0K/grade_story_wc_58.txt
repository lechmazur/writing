<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her ritual of “projecting presence” is embodied, not abstract, and the crimson thread circling her finger literalizes grief under pressure. The micro-choice to braid the strand into her hair crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the fantasy of reunion. Interior contradiction flickers only once (“she had never understood why…until now”), but the prior eleven years of practice earn the epiphany. Voice stays individual, never sliding into diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pages placed beneath the stone plus the thread in the braid reconfigure absence as artifact, not wound, with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory fragment—maple leaves “the color of dried blood,” loosening weft—intensifies the dominant stake until the final object reprices it. No causal break; every beat is a therefore/because of ritual repetition narrowing to this last obituary. Cost is legible in the finger-groove the thread has cut, paid on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is rendered through tactile occupation: carpet under thigh, moss swallowing stone, cold seeping through clothes—details that constrain her to stay until dawn. Season is not postcard but instrumental: persimmons “left too long in the sun” echo Matthias’s untimely decay, autumn’s slow rot mirroring memory’s. Spatial choreography is immaculate; lantern pinpricks vanish beyond a legible harbor edge. The crimson thread operates as micro-setting, re-anchoring every beat; its final braid-position fulfills the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether obituary-writing can transmute private grief—tightens once: the moment she turns the pen on herself. That single pivot is sufficient under Accumulative lens; prior client sketches accumulate density until the pattern breaks inward. Cost is visible in the finger-groove and the dawn-cold stiffness as she rises, foreclosing the option to keep Matthias “alive” through further commissions. No external antagonist is needed; erosion of meaning supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: writing as cartography of loss, maps that redraw absence into bearable terrain. The carpet thread’s color shift—from throne-room grandeur to blood-bright injury to braid-cord keepsake—reweights “explained absence” from bureaucratic theft to intimate artifact. Final image offers conceptual repricing: absence is not missing piece but portable thread, a map one chooses to carry. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is fierce: “obituaries for the living,” “amber darkness,” “lonesome splendor”—all coinages that could only belong to this narrator. Rhythm modulates from long cadences of lament to the clipped final clause “ready to chart the next landscape,” mirroring stance crystallization. No head-hopping; third-person hovers at intimate distance, never leaking omniscience. Diction stays within Elara’s weaver-writer lexicon—warp, weft, map, thread—without ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence music is deliberate yet never algorithmic; parallelism serves ritual (“She wrote until…until…until…”) then fractures into the single-stroke final braid. Metaphors are concrete and internally consistent—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One near-artifact: “lonesome splendor” risks loftiness, but the prior eleven years of grounded specificity earn the elevated note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—traveler who writes obituaries for the living—is fresh, and the inversion to self-obituary feels inevitable in hindsight. Autumn-garden setting plus textile micro-object avoids default fantasy ruins trap by focusing on sensory aftermath, not spectacle. Risk is lyric compression rather than causal plot, but coherence under Accumulative lens validates the choice. Could not swap Elara’s vocation or the crimson thread without collapsing the story’s logic.</comment>
