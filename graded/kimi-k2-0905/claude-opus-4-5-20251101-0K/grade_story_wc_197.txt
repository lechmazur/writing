<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet-opposition persona is credibly seeded, but we never see interior contradiction under pressure—every move proceeds smoothly from plan. The grandmother key cue is the only moment where emotion might fracture composure, yet it’s summarized, not dramatized. Because the raid compresses all risk into off-stage explosion and unseen upload, the visible cost on Mira herself is missing; her reappearance feels competence-heavy rather than endurance-paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single causal track (Vault → upload → reappearance) is coherent and lands a clean Charged Poise: her daily smile now carries the secret knowledge that truths are leaking worldwide. Stakes tighten only once—midnight raid alert—so escalation is thin; nevertheless, the lens holds. Closure cost is conceptual (global doubt seeded) rather than personal, fulfilling the Hybrid lens judged at the end.</comment>

<comment>Bioluminescent lagoon & buried Pacific-Bell infrastructure create tactile, near-future texture without catalog bloat. Starlit water reflections double as map and mirror, charging the final image when Mira watches the same glow knowing it now frames subversion. Spatial choreography keeps lagoon, shaft and Vault distinct and reachable; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent forever-loss of true history—arrives early and recurs. One meaningful tightening: midnight deadline collapses 3-year plan into hours, forcing the premature upload. Cost is offloaded to unseen global audience rather than Mira’s body or future safety, so pressure feels moderated; still, her choice to stay embedded supplies credible agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>History-as-battlefield emerges through concrete props (original newspapers, Pacific Bell key) and ends with the quiet re-pricing: engineered beauty now tagged with erased blood. No explicit thesis statements; council’s “harmless” lagoon is re-viewed through newly leaked documents. Theme gains depth by refusing triumphalism—Council will revise again—yet the image of golden water seen with awakened doubt lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature leans architectural ("engineered...forgettable") and archival ("margins and signatures"). No dialogue, so voice is carried by interior cadence that stays controlled, almost reportorial, matching clandestine temperament. Occasional elevated diction ("auric lagoon," "conceptual repricing") slightly overshoots Mira’s civil-service perch but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Generally crisp, but small loops appear: "quietly, resourcefully" echoed near identical phrasing within sixty words; "they would...they never" template cadence repeats. Figurative control good—no mixed metaphors—yet rhythm could vary more under stealth tension. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Revisionist dystopia is familiar, but linking extinct telecom hardware to secret map-reading via starlit puddles offers fresh inflection. Underestimated-archivist trope is lifted by specificity of her method: light-geometry navigation using buried phone-company maintenance port. Risk is present yet safe—story avoids exploring darker personal price after upload. Specific detail keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
