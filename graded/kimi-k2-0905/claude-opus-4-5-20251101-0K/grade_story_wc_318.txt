<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Victor’s grief is palpably embodied through the pull-cord handle, and his contradictory need to sing yet fear of sound is kept in tension; the micro-choice to place the handle on the tunnel floor before singing shows motive turned action. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only “stones in chest” and “wound-like smile.” The final climb out carrying “laughter’s possibility” is earned because the tunnel has literally vibrated his silence apart; cost is visible in his cracked voice and the salt of tears on plastic. Cap at 8.7 because the daughter’s voice is only reported, never sampled on-page, blunting full relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tunnel converts off-key grief into a charged poise that lets Victor re-enter the world carrying a new silence—one that now has room for future sound. Causal chain holds: because the tunnel macerates song → therefore silence softens → therefore he can phone Margaret; the persistent constraint is the frayed cord he still clutches, its vibration an objective reminder the process is real. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“beneath the abandoned estate”) and the hourglass image signals time. Cost is legible in the final line: “something that had been clenched began to loosen”—physical, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its curved walls bend sound back until photographs flutter, literally constraining Victor’s next move—he must keep singing or be crushed by his own echo. Sensory hierarchy adheres: a leaf-blower maestro notices “frequencies he felt rather than heard.” The handle’s worn plastic and frayed rope are micro-setting that charge the final image when it thrums against his chest. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-place-arrange-sing; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can grief be un-made?”—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows to a single physical test: can off-key song soften calcified silence. Escalation is Accumulative: each cracked lullaby increases acoustic density until the photographs flutter and the cord vibrates; failure would mean permanent muteness. The visible price is paid on-page—voice breaks, tears salt the floor, and the final silence is fuller precisely because it has been hollowed out by sound. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is not cured but macerated—softened until it can be carried differently. The pull-cord reweights from tool to metronome to child-surrogate; laughter shifts from lost object to possible future sound. Final image of “a sleeping child” pressed to chest is Conceptual Repricing: fatherhood is not restored but reconfigured as potential rather than memory. No moral, only lived paradox—sound can hollow silence without filling it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Victor’s perceptual filter: he notices acoustics, machine parts, salt taste of tears. Syntax lengthens and fragments under pressure—“He sang the wordless sounds of a household at peace”—mirroring breathless singing. No head-hopping; Margaret and Emma appear only as he remembers them. Diction remains in his lexicon: “maestro,” “pull-cord,” “macerate” learned from groundskeeper’s journal. Rhythm accelerates then thins at closure, matching exhausted exhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances grief or sound. Figurative language is selective—“tunnel like a throat that had forgotten how to swallow” sets stakes immediately and is never repeated. High information density: “salt to the sound” does double duty as sensory detail and metaphor for tears. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (sound vibrating photographs is impossible but internally cued). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, not abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The leaf-blower maestro who orchestrates grief with half-sung lullabies is a fresh synthesis; no prior story pairs landscape maintenance with acoustic exorcism. The tunnel as echo-chamber-therapist transforms familiar grief-therapy trope into site-specific ritual. Risky second-person metaphor (“throat that had forgotten how to swallow”) pays off when Victor’s own throat cracks on lullabies. Specificity—frayed cord, off-key wind, salt on plastic—prevents gimmick; emotional truth carries novelty.</comment>
