<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—“she simply listened to what the paper remembered”—but the shift from passive observer to axis-restorer is declared, not dramatized. The single micro-choice (wrapping the fragment) is too light to bear the climactic purpose; we are told the cost is “weight” but do not feel her body pay it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry proves the axis tilt predates the Silence, reframing Maren’s quest. Causal linkage holds—diary → tapestry → map—but the decisive turn is summarized (“understood her purpose with sudden clarity”) rather than played beat-by-beat, muting the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The silo’s “bronze quiet” and curved concrete function as both archive and resonant instrument; the tapestry fragment is handled, turned, pocketed—an object that literally re-weights the world. Micro-setting excellence compensates for sparse external geography.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the lost axis—signals early; pressure tightens when tapestry redefines the quest from antiquarian to existential. Escalation is single-step, not recursive, but the tightening forecloses the option of mere cataloguing, charging the final walk east.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “listening to mute matter” emerges through tactile beats; the ending re-prices decoration itself as hidden cartography. Quiet avoidance of moralising keeps the resonance earned; bronze hush becomes the audible cost of a world without dreams.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person stays tightly glued to Maren’s perceptual filter—“she listened to what the paper remembered”—with patterned diction (“bronze quiet,” “strange gravity”) that teaches its cadence early. No head-hop; compressions like “three seasons learning” are strategic, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentences vary from fragmentary (“The dragons aren’t decorative”) to sinuous piles that mirror spiral stairs. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“existential axis”) slightly overshoots Maren’s implied lexicon but never loops or muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-dream archaeologist who hears wall-memories—feels fresh; tapestry-as-map and Silence-as-prehistoric condition invert expected causality. Risk in conceptual stakes is high yet coherent; specificity of textile topology anchors the novelty.</comment>
