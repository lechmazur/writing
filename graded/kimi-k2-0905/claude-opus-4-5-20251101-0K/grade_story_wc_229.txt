<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet competence and grief-tempered tenderness feel lived-in; her micro-choice to palm the cork and then extend her hand crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The boy’s flickering ghost-body and ocean-heavy eyes individuate him without exposition. No interior contradiction is dramatized in-scene, so the arc leans on earned stasis rather than a turn; that caps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Mira holding both cork and boy reweights the rule-set—tending the living and the lost is now one job. Causality is lyric-accumulative: scent→arrival→hand→descent; each beat deepens the central stake of listening as rescue. The cost is felt in the lingering scent’s fade and the boy’s still-flickering edges, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt tower’s bruised paint, stone breathing after heat, and salt-crusted glass are worked into ascent and gesture; environment steers choice when Mira decides the tower is the only place that can receive the boy. The vial cork micro-setting constrains the final gesture, charging the closing image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent—no postcard filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving quiet intent can save—tightens once: the boy’s arrival embodies the test. The tightening is the hand-beckon that forecloses abandonment; price is Mira’s acceptance of perpetual double-tending. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, sufficient for this length; cost is legible in the flickering boy and fading scent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particularized action: dead birds, cork, flickering body. Final image answers the thematic question—whispers do travel farther—without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: the boy is neither fully saved nor fully lost. No echoic thesis statement; resonance is imaged, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: “stone breathe,” “ocean eyes,” syntax breathes with her fatigue. No head-hop; distance tightens at hand-off moment. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric compression. Voice modulation under stress is visible in the fragment “Come, the gesture said.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates on spiral ascent, then softens at hand-off; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—bruised lighthouse, ocean eyes—never stacked. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines perform double duty: anchor stakes / recharge motif. Zero scaffolding artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rescue-via-listening is familiar; the inverse rescue—ghost boy summoned by being heard—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Cobalt lighthouse + cork + scent create an idiosyncratic signature. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure is purposeful and paid off. No derivative echo of famous scenes.</comment>
