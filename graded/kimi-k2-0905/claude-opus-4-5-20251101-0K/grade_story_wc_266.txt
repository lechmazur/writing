<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied—“small fears and swallowed words,” “every word she’d never spoken”—and her gathering of deferred flames at climax is a concrete, earned micro-choice that costs her the safety of regret. The ferry guides function more as choral atmosphere than relationship crucible, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are N/A; their lullaby cadence still modulates her stance. No competence inflation or safety-hedging; she remains credibly flawed. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“I was a coward”) instantly softened by the guide’s counter, so no deduction touches closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira’s star-punch reclaims deferred courage-flames, reconfiguring her future with undeniable conceptual cost—“no longer leashed, no longer lost.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each star-punch beat deepens the pattern rather than reverses plot, and the final image crystallizes options under twilight vigil rules. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“veiled ridgeway”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the piece teaches its elliptical logic early and pays it off in the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The veiled ridgeway itself functions as micro-setting: its twilight mist literally parts to reveal Mira’s unlived paths, constraining her route to the indirect. Lantern-star punches reprise as tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—she notices shorelines, passport edges, the warmth of flames against her chest—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across the crest-to-shore descent. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled in the title image and tightens through each star-punch mark; the final gathering of flames is the visible price that forecloses lifelong regret. Escalation is textural: pattern density increases until the horizon blaze reweights meaning. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. Cost is unmistakable—the flames warm her chest, proving the transfer from potential to lived bravery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of star-punched flames, never abstract assertion. The final image offers a non-literal answer: courage is not lost but waiting, and reclaiming it means accepting the lifelong cost of deferred living. Subtext operates in gesture—lantern swing, star shimmer—rather than exposition. No moralizing closure; the lullaby tone modulates into quiet triumph without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: “lanterns burning with the soft persistence of stars that refuse to fade” is both sight and metaphor filtered through Mira’s regret. Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence to short, breath-catching fragments at each unlived reveal. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Mira. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but voice-bearing—eldest guide’s shoreline-smoothed kindness contrasts with Mira’s swallowed silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with ascent/descent. Information density is high: “star-shaped impression that glimmered and faded like a promise half-remembered” does image + theme + stakes in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; no typos or homophones. Only a single near-repeat of “gently persistent” keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—“ferry guides who ticket-punch unspent courage from a twilight ridgeway”—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Star-punch as magical object is specific to this world, not generic portal talisman. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty: the insight that courage waits rather than vanishes is non-obvious and earned. Risk-taking in lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry. Minor proximity to “ferryman” tropes is transformed through maternal-lullaby idiom and shoreline imagery.</comment>
