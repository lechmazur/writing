<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s grief-propelled ritualism is viscerally embodied; the moth-wing relic and rope-knot language make her refusal to let the species vanish tangible. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—yet the lone on-page choice (building then dismantling the frames) costs her the last physical trace of grandmother. The cap at 8.7 reflects no contradictory impulse in-scene; renunciation is earned but micro-choices are sparse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the butterflies pause, acknowledge, move on—an undeniable reconfiguration of Vera’s witness. Causality is accumulative/textural: each knotted frame intensifies the density of memory until the final spiral of wings reweights the stake. The cost is the moth wing itself—relinquished to the wind—and the grotto’s impermanence, both legible in the last line. No orientation debt; pattern is taught by 120-word mark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s altitude, mist, and pink-gold light constrain every knot and footfall; the suspended driftwood frames literally cannot outlast the first storm, forcing transient design. Micro-setting objects—moth wing, hemp rope—serve as magnetic/memory beacons that shape butterfly flight paths. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s esoteric realism: she notices wind currents and wing beats over panoramic vistas. Setting charges the final image when the last monarch brushes the relic before vanishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witness the final migration—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the monarchs physically acknowledge the frames. Agency is accumulative: each knot adds witness-density; the sixteen-second pause on the moth wing crystallizes the trade-off—she keeps the notebook but loses the wing. Cost is felt in the silent grotto afterward. No causal antagonist, but extinction itself supplies coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inverse of preservation: impermanent structures honor memory more honestly than archives. The moth-wing relic reframes extinction as intimate, not statistical. Final image—stars above an unmapped grotto—reweights “overlooked histories” without moralizing. No thesis statement; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: “esoteric realist” diction, knot-as-language, wind-as-data. Syntax mirrors her tactile precision—short, corded sentences when lashing frames; longer breaths during cloud watch. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under butterfly arrival. Prose texture is distinctive yet never obscures causality.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: clipped clauses during construction, airy elongation during wait, hush at wing-whisper. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“frozen melody” for knotted rope). No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances frame-building or deepens atmosphere. Minor filter verbs appear but serve Vera’s observational mode without dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—data-encoded rope cathedrals for a dying butterfly species—is non-obvious and grows inevitable through Vera’s grandmother mythos. Risk: using a single preserved moth wing as communication relic could feel symbolic, yet its grief origin and sixteen-second pause ground the logic. Fresh inflection: extinction rendered as intimate courtesy, not spectacle. Transient rootedness becomes both method and moral stance.</comment>
