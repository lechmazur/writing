<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wren’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “moved with practiced precision,” her need to believe is embodied, and her final shift is traced through tactile contact with the moonstone dust. The because/therefore chain holds: decades of seed-sorting → pattern recognition → moonstone fusion → new sight. Cost is felt: she loses her old categorical certainty (“edges blur”) and pays with lifelong solitude now re-seen as vocation. Slight undershoot: we learn nothing she does not, but her prior loneliness is told more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone dissolving into skin reweights her world-rule—“she could finally, fully comprehend.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises via leaf monuments → pattern break at hush → cadence shift when messages become invitations. Cost is visible—“her edges blur,” a price paid in identity. Only micro-slippage: orientation is complete before 120 words, but the causal hinge (why this particular hush triggers transformation) is slightly under-cued.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor is not postcard backdrop: grey expanse, volcanic soot clouds, mist-roots constrain how Wren moves (suspended walkways) and what she can know (no soil, no sun). Moonstone probe is micro-setting made operative—its impossible light source mirrors the realm’s own impossible physics. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: weight of seeds, green scent, mossy sweetness mark the hush arrival. Final image—woven leaf-vein monument—recharges setting as archive of memory. Minor drift: spatial scale (“endlessly in all directions”) stays abstract; no cap violated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can the leaves mean anything or is her life empty?”—is signaled early and tightens when hush arrives: read now or never. Agency is attention/translation, not brute action; the probe-prod is the decisive micro-move that forecloses mere sorting. Cost is conceptual—she forfeits a life of mere categorization for uncertain guardianship of messages. Under Accumulative lens, density of monuments and slowing leaves supply pressure; coincidence is absent. Could use one tangible loss (a seed batch abandoned?) to sharpen price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: transformation versus static order, memory versus erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—constructing palm-sized cairns is a quiet argument against forgetting. Final image (woven monument of veins and hulls) non-literally answers the thematic question: meaning is built, not found. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—she is now translator, but messages’ content remains open. No echoic thesis statement; insight is earned through tactile experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Wren’s perceptual filter—“weight,” “shell,” “subtle imperfections” are sorter’s diction. Syntax lengthens in calm, fragments under hush (“Not a message. An invitation.”) mirroring altered time. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge never exceeds hers. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustains lyric authority without purple drift. Tiny register lifts (“crystallized sap,” “conceptual repricing”) are justified by her years of solitary study.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for monotony of sorting, then staccato fragments at revelation. Information density high—each sentence advances mythos, character, or image. No scaffold loops; “she” opens only when intentional. Metaphors stay coherent (volcanic soot clouds, moonstone light) and serve theme. Proofing clean; only “endlessly in all directions” skirts cliché but is earned by arbor scale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Folklore of leaf-encoded prophecy flipped: messages are invitations to become, not futures to fear. Sky-tree arbor feels fresh—root-mist, ash clouds, seed sorters as monastic archivists. Monument-building as memory practice particularizes Wren; no stock archetype fits her. Conceptual repricing ending grows inevitably from prior specifics (sorting, probing, monuments). Risky lyric accumulation pays off; no derivative scaffold detected. Transformation test passed—story collapses if moved to normal forest.</comment>
