<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“songs remained embedded in her throat like seeds”—and her amnesia/remembering arc drives every beat; the final self-erasure is foreshadowed and costs her everything, satisfying earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the price—“she would remember nothing of herself and everything of her people”—is legible, irreversible, and charged by the accumulative pattern of song→mica→web. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held; the single shard escalates via density shift rather than causal turns, ending in Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s crystalline night, phosphorescent apples, and mica panes are filtered through Elara’s body and memory loss; the swaddled windows become the micro-setting that physically enables the final light-web. Spatial choreography is clean; every sensory detail is repurposed into the culminating weave, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling dawn—is signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens via accumulating song resonance that forecloses solitude and demands total self-dissolution. The cost is visible in the final line; escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of memory-as-self vs. memory-as-collective; the closing image reweights the premise without moralizing. The woven-dawn metaphor carries conceptual cost—individual identity is the price for communal survival—creating lingering ambiguity rather than tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“mica windows catching no sunlight”) is consistent, rhythmic, and purposefully compressed. No dialogue appears; voice modulates from tentative to incantatory as pressure rises, sustaining poetic coherence without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative language is selective, never crowding a single beat. One paraphrase loop—“memories scattered like seeds… fragments… beyond her grasp”—is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mirror-world absence of sunlight, song-powered mica looms, and self-annihilating dawn-weaver feel freshly synthesized rather than borrowed. Risk lies in the lyric static-accumulative structure itself; it pays off, but the concept’s inversion of personal memory into communal light is what lingers.</comment>
