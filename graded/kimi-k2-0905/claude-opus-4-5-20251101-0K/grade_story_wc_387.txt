<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mirelle’s interiority is concrete—calloused fingers, seventeen years of watching, the decision to publish nothing—yet her contradictory impulse (share/ conceal) stays summary, not dramatized in-scene. The grandmother memory anchors motive, but the climactic choice to keep whistling merely extends what she already does; cost is felt as elegiac hush rather than a foreclosed path. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to power the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rain-soft return confirms her covenant with unseen labor, reweighting her decades of secrecy. Causality is accumulative/textural: the whisk, whistle, and moon paths layer until the final conducting image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 9; no lens ambiguity. Minor drag: the “demure audacity” label arrives late and slightly summarizes the beat that should externalize the contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet’s wind-crenellations, gargoyle drips, and post-storm air currents are tactile constraints that shape firefly flight and her whistle acoustics. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, its worn tines directing insect light and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to her net-mender gaze—moisture as text, mesh knots as cosmology—anchoring mood without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect the hidden order she alone witnesses. Escalation is a density increase: each season’s data, the grandmother’s silence, tonight’s synchrony tighten her resolve rather than widen options. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological—knowledge wants disclosure, she chooses occlusion—paid in the closing image of rain starting “softly now,” a hush that costs her public vindication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating asymmetry of labor and witness: grandmother’s tea, spiders’ webs, fireflies’ code, Mirelle’s nets—all perform beauty no one credits. The final rain re-prices this: the world keeps its own secrets gracefully, endorsement enough. No moral is stated; the whistle-echo supplies a non-literal answer. Slight loss: the phrase “demure audacity” edges toward thesis-label, muting full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains fixed inside Mirelle’s perceptual filter; diction—“net-mender philosopher,” “moon paths,” “mathematics hidden in their knots”—is idiosyncratic yet believable. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments (“She listened”) under peak attention. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through textured narration that sounds like her inner whistle—quiet, precise, persistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “water still dripped…rhythm she had learned to read like text” layers setting, character, and metaphor without flab. Figurative control is tight—light as “infinitesimal lanterns,” rain that “understood”—each image pays off in the closing paragraph. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“conducting the fireflies like an orchestra”) is minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The firefly-code/whistle convergence feels inevitable yet uncannily fresh; no extant template fuses net-mending, tea-whisk memorial, and insect cryptography. Risk is quiet—no twist, just steadfast secrecy—but that refusal of revelation is the bold choice. Specificity of coastal tower acoustics and moon-track geometry prevents generic “nature mystic” drift. Transforms familiar solitude-into-mystery trope through material labor lens.</comment>
