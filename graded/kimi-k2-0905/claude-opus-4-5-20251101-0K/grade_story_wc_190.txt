<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eris’s embodied grief—tuned to cable thrum and vial swirl—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she opens the vial she risks the last tangible shard of Mira, a palpable cost. Interiority stays sensory, never diagnostic. The only drag is a slight over-calibration of competence—seventeen flawless years can dull the sense of ongoing struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terrace’s silence is permanently rewired by the dissolved crystals, and the cost—final loss of the relic—hits on-page. Causal chain is spare but complete: monitor → locate pocket → open vial → silence transformed. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; the helix image teaches the pattern early and re-weights at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its angles dictate where stillness forms and thus where Eris must stop and act. Crystal facets, cable tension, and auroral twilight are filtered through an acoustic engineer’s ear, never touristic. Spatial choreography stays clean as the gondola glides, brakes, and departs. Only the absence of weather’s physical bite keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create a gentler silence—tightens once: the vial’s opening irreversibly forfeits both artifact and old acoustic order. Pressure is textural: each descriptive layer (light, hush, crystal spiral) raises the emotional ante until the final reconfiguration. No visible external antagonist, but the terrace’s own acoustic law supplies sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief can be alchemized into a shared acoustic gift rather than a private echo. The helix reprise in the closing hush re-weights the opening image without moralizing. No character utters a thesis; meaning arrives through sensorial reconfiguration. The slight softness comes from an untested counter-reading—comfort is assumed universal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature fuses maritime engineer and mourning mother: cables “sing,” silence “presses like a living thing,” vial crystals form a “staircase ascending toward nothing.” Diction stays within Eris’s technical lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm breathes with gondola drift then tightens at brake-release, mirroring her pulse under decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—sound physics, paternal grief, world lore—without syntactic scaffold. Metaphors are few, clean, and physically coherent. Only a faint cadence echo (“the terrace simply…”) drifts toward template, not enough to blunt the final line. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally with cable tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic grief-engineering aboard a twilight crystal transit. Trope roots—mourner seeks sign—are remade through speculative architecture and material science. The storm-glass-as-urn gambit feels inevitable after its meteorological setup. Minor risk: premise edges toward solarpunk elegy already visible in some journals, but execution stays specific enough to transcend label.</comment>
