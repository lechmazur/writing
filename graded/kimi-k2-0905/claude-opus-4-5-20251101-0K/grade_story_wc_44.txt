<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s “quietly deliberate” trait is repeatedly asserted and shows in micro-choices (tracing runes, slow key turn), giving her a consistent, usable edge. Interiority stays concrete—her racing heart against steady hands—yet never deepens into contradiction or flaw that could complicate the final sealing. The grandmother link supplies emotional fuel, but the automaton is the one that pressures her; Mira’s own stakes plateau after the first third. Competence is balanced with “barely learning,” but no misbelief or internal cost surfaces to shadow the victory, so the endurance lacks a felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is legible: bent reality → key found → automaton awakened → sealing runes performed → shadows return. Orientation lands within 80 words and telescopes are pointed at “spaces between stars,” a quick, world-defining image. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Mira now shoulders a guardian role—but the price is asserted (“she would be ready”) rather than dramatized in a beat of forfeiture or fear. One minor causality fuzz: automaton claims “timing requires precision,” yet no on-page mis-timing risk or deadline ever constrains her hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating twilight isle, brass observatory, and star-lit clouds are economically sketched and filtered through Mira’s scholar gaze. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual, a hint of gear-whisper—but selection fits the hush of “perpetual twilight.” Setting supplies the only tools (telescopes, rune-slots) that make the sealing possible, so environment directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting of the key-slot beneath the telescope base is a small, tactile anchor that passes the 9+ gate by constraining her final gesture.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled in paragraph two and braided with personal legacy (grandmother’s key). Pressure tightens once: when automaton warns that sealing must happen before shadows return, creating a timing hazard. However, no visible price is paid on page—no mis-sealed crack, no energy drain, no renounced desire—so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is coherent under causal lens but stays linear; one meaningful tightening suffices for length, yet the absence of a live risk keeps it short of high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The bending of reality and the exile of shadows pose a metaphysical question that resolves into the idea that knowledge itself must be relearned as the world rewrites its rules. Theme emerges through images—curled spoons, brass automaton, sealing loops—never articulated as thesis until the final line, which avoids moralizing. Subtext lingers in the grandmother’s unseen life and the automaton’s memory, inviting reflection on generational transmission of duty. The reweighting is subtle: “some loops are meant to be closed” reframes the rune ritual as perpetual caretaking, not a one-time fix.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira with clean psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction is lightly elevated—“borrowed starlight,” “language of power”—but remains within a scholar-apprentice lexicon. Rhythm varies from long, winding sentences that mimic spiral stairs to short, chime-like automaton speech. No dialogue between humans, so voice distinctness is shown through Mira’s quiet precision against the brass figure’s cryptic aphorisms. Perceptual signature is present: she notices runes, mechanisms, and star-gaps rather than landscape prettiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“she had spent weeks learning to relearn”) repeats root ideas. Metaphors are spare and coherent—spoons “curling like dying leaves,” automaton “unfolding like a flower remembering spring”—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can layer world fact, character mood, and plot cue. Opening and closing lines carry ear-rhythm and thematic echo. A lone filter-verb cluster (“she knew,” “she understood”) is acceptable mid-reflection and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of “apprentice awakens ancient guardian” is refreshed by the shadows-as-refugees concept and the bent-reality rune mechanics. The spoon curl image is a sharp, domestic entry point to cosmic skewing. Specificity of telescopes aimed at inter-star darkness, brass key with unknown teeth, and loop-sealing runes keeps the world from feeling generic. While the plot arc is classically heroic, the metaphysical premise and grandmotherly key inheritance feel particular to this narrator. Risk is moderate; the piece commits fully to its internal logic without retreat, but does not push formal or moral boundaries further.</comment>
