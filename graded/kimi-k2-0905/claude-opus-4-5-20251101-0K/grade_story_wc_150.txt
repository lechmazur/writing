<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s contradiction—skeptic arriving to debunk, then volunteering to resurrect the orchard—drives every beat. Her embodied awe (“breath caught… warmly curious wonder”) and tactile micro-choices (shaping the gnomon, pocketing seeds) keep interiority concrete. The cost is legible: she abandons her original excavation goal, straps the broken dial to her pack, and accepts the burden of starting new pilgrimages. Only minor slip: the inherited map and maternal retreat are recounted more than dramatized, blunting the full sting of familial failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: diaspora skepticism → orchard discovery → dial repair → light generation → vow to replant. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing apples re-price time itself as faith-made, not solar, and Mira shoulders continuous, unpaid custodianship. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. The flashback block (mother’s retreat) is safely under 20 % and cues present choice—she places the gnomon to finish what her mother fled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is sensory, specific, and choice-guiding: roots threading skulls dictate where Mira steps; bone-shadows become moving hour-lines after the repair. Spatial choreography is flawless—she kneels inside the four-tree altar, straps the heavy stone to her pack, and the environment answers back with light. The setting literally generates the closure image (glowing fruit casting bone-shadows), satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “soil and sweetness and something older” drifts toward catalogue, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove ancestral faith wasted vs. restore it—tightens when the glowing apples force her to choose: leave the dial underground or carry its weight topside. The sundial’s activation is the single decisive escalation: it turns perpetual dark into livable time, foreclosing her original plan to expose a hoax. Cost is visible: she hoists the stone, accepts endless replanting duties, and loses her skeptic identity. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational, crystallizing her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “life persists through bone” is never asserted—evinced by seeds sprouting in skulls and Mira’s choice to replant. Tokens, roots, and the broken gnomon reweight from relics to living obligations at the end. The final image (she climbs out carrying time itself) offers a non-moralizing answer: faith is not certainty but sustainable wonder. Minor echo of “interrupted journeys” in closing paragraph nudges toward summary, but it’s one clause.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: “patient fingers,” “warmly curious wonder,” tactile attention to copper wire and soil. Syntax elongates under awe, shortens under action (“She began to rebuild.”). No dialogue, so no contamination. One near-slip: “something older than memory” edges universal, but is saved by immediate bodily reaction. Voice is coherent, textured, and modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, almost lyrical yet free of purple loops: “roots threading through skulls like patient fingers” does triple sensory work. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; each clause advances image, stakes, or emotion. Filter verbs appear twice but are voice-motivated. The final paragraph repeats “interrupted journey,” but it’s a deliberate callback, not artifact. Closure line (“growing light from bone”) is crisp, unadorned, and recharges every prior motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Underground bone-orchard that grows time instead of sunlight is a fresh synthesis of catacomb, pilgrimage, and horticulture tropes. The sundial that measures faith-hours rather than sun-hours elegantly reprices the object’s cultural meaning. Risk—glowing fruit reversing entropy—pays off by making metaphor literal without breaking internal logic. If transplanted to another place or cast, the core reversal (skeptic becomes keeper of impossible time) would collapse, proving specificity.</comment>
