<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vera’s motive—map the unknown while humans sleep—drives every move; her tactile readings of rock and fossil translate into concrete micro-choices. The interior contradiction between solitary purpose and emerging inter-species duty is embodied, not declared. Final kneeling/offering beat crystallizes a value shift with visible cost: she commits to speak for the unheard, foreclosing pure solitude. Missing full 9: no secondary pressure from on-page character or status swing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: fossil lifted toward bioluminescent spheres reweights her task and humanity’s place, undeniable cost felt in the hush. Causal chain—fossil warmth → deeper descent → encounter → mutual mapping—holds under inferred Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught by rising thermal/emotional strata. One clean shard; anchors clear by line 3. No meaningful tightening or price after midpoint keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Limestone damp, exhaled warmth, black-water river—details are selective, sensory, filtered through Vera’s thermal POV. Cave geography stays coherent; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from wall to passage to chamber to river. Elm fossil functions as micro-setting that constrains final gesture. Missing 9: environment does not actively resist or wound; no persistent physical price.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—record earth’s silent memory—meets rising counter-pressure: unknown intelligences now want to record her. Mid-story fossil pulse provides meaningful tightening; options narrow from solo mapping to reciprocal translation. Cost legible in her audible voice breaking months of silence, yet no tangible loss or irreversible forfeiture shown. Sufficient for length; lacks visceral price to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of listening across epochs emerges through fossil and floating responses, never sermonized. Elm leaf’s reprise as inter-species invitation reconfigures earlier grief-tinged reading into mutual recognition. Final image of “messages to depths she could not follow” invites lingering ambiguity without confusion. Holds at 8.7 because subtext stays implicit; no secondary counter-theme complicates the chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Vera’s thermal register: diction of gradient, pulse, strata, bioluminescence stays inside her professional idiom. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for descent, shorter fragments at luminous encounter—mirrors tension without drumbeat monotony. No filter-verb clusters; perception remains embodied. Just shy of 9: syntax could push further at climax to mimic sensor blur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“fossilized joys, the transitional objects that civilizations had left behind”) layer job without purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every paragraph advances knowledge or image. Metaphors consistent (map, breath, letter) and physically coherent. One hairline slip—“emotions of creatures she had no name for” edges toward label—keeps from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of paleobotany, neuro-thermal sensing, and post-human hibernation feels fresh yet inevitable. Fossil-as-transitional-bridge reverses typical time-travel souvenir: child’s goodbye reaches future mapper, who then bridges to subterranean species. Familiar eco-healing frame is subverted by underground first-contact; risk of sentimental “earth remembers” is averted when map becomes two-way. Specificity of thermal cartography as sensory language secures memorability.</comment>
