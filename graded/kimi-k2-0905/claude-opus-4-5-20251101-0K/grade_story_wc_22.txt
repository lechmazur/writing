<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Erasmus’s grief-riven solitude and linguist’s calling are vivid, but interiority verges on lyrical self-label (“languages of the dead”). Micro-choices (crushing pods, answering heron) are present yet low-cost; no contradictory impulse in scene to sharpen flaw or trade-off. Endurance is earned, but the cost feels contemplative rather than charged. Still, a singular, memorable consciousness drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each beat layers reef-to-flower chemistry, bird-message density, and seed-release ritual toward the final glowing image. Closure is a Charged Poise: future garden crystallizes as inevitable possibility while Erasmus stands in poignantly legible stasis. Anchors (who/where/when) signalled by line 3; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual—reef’s dissolution forever alters sea and self—made legible in “garden that existed mostly in the future.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blooming jetty’s phosphorescent planks, calcified water chemistry, and bird-perch pilings are tactile, sensory, and choice-relevant: seeds must enter this exact current at this glow intensity. Environment directly supplies the minerals that will sprout tomorrow’s shoots, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (seed pods, leather pouch) handled repeatedly, states tracked. One minor over-lyric (“narrow vastness of the twilight sea”) slightly dilutes specificity, but overall setting constrains tactics and resonates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—battlefield reclamation through off-grid botany—signalled early. Escalation is accumulative: each evening’s seed release increases mineral-fed floral density, narrowing options toward lifelong commitment. Visible cost is the slow surrender of Erasmus’s remaining years to nightly ritual; felt in “he would return tomorrow, and the day after….” No external antagonist, but reef death / time become coherent pressures. Agency is iterative yet real; final stance crystallizes as Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection-through-decay emerges from concrete particulars (reef calcium poppy pods, glowing planks) never abstract assertion. Subtext flourishes in bird languages—diplomacy across species that sidesteps human speechlessness after war. Final image reweights earlier material: dissolution becomes generosity, battlefield becomes garden, solitude becomes communion. Avoids moralizing; invites reflection on geologic time versus human grief. Emotional aftereffect lingers as awe-tinged melancholy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance, diction aligned to Erasmus’s scholarly bereavement: “Sumerian best,” “Linear B that he had reconstructed.” Rhythm ebbs and flows like tidal sentences, mirroring surf-patterned ritual. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Perceptual signature is consistent—bird calls read as genuine syntax, not magical trope. Experimental compression (lyric loops) taught early, paid off in glowing closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer chemistry, myth, and grief without scaffolding. Figurative language mostly apt (“stones grinding underwater”) though two adjacent metaphors for twilight sea edge toward excess. No loops, stock openers, or filter-verb stacks. High information-to-word ratio; each sensory stroke advances scene. Proofing clean; only minor cadence repetition (“each evening… each morning”) but reads purposeful. Final line lands with resonant lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: battlefield-to-reef-to-garden via interspecies linguistics feels inevitable yet unprecedented. Bird-call cryptography treated as serious epistemic practice, not whimsy. Risky lyric accumulative structure paid off through luminous closure reweighting. Specificity of poppy/vetch pods, phosphorescent planks, and Akkadian terns prevents trope drift. Emotional truth—solitary atonement via biogeochemistry—offers durable originality beyond gimmick.</comment>
