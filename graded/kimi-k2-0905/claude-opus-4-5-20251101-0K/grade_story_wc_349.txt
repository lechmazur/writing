<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—ex-forger hungering for originality while fearing the bracelet’s arithmetic—are alive in every beat; her micro-choice to drip moonlight onto the slate crystallizes the arc. The child’s entrance forces a visible shift from self-protection to nurturance, embodying earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“the word felt like the first sentence of something new”) rather than diagnostic. The bracelet’s pulse and the child’s too-old eyes supply embodied emotion without therapy-speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the child writing reconfigures meaning so that “the place where stories begin” becomes the human act, not a location. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is a because/therefore of Vera preparing slates → child appears → story ignites → bracelet dims. Orientation anchored by 120 words (glass orchard library, parole bracelet, Sea of Sorrowing Mist). Cost is legible on the page: the bracelet’s measurable dimming and Vera’s relinquishing of anonymity to welcome the child.</comment>

<comment>Glass trees, moonlight-filled slates, and the bracelet’s pulse act as micro-setting that constrains choice: only glass forgives revision, moonlight must be dripped not poured, bracelet light pulses arithmetic. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Vera notices opacity of clouds like “cream dissolving in coffee,” tactile evidence of her bartering past. Spatial choreography clean: child ascends cloud-stairs, touches slate, words appear. The setting’s “integrated fragmentation” mirrors thematic question of brokenness that can still hold light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Vera’s need to prove she can originate rather than steal stories—tightens when the child arrives; one meaningful escalation turns the lull into live test. Agency remains causal: her decision to prepare slates with moonlight enables the child to write, directly dimming the bracelet. No coincidence; the child’s arrival is external pressure but resolution is her welcoming act. Cost is visible: bracelet’s dimming quantifies her risk of exposure if the story fails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: redemption is not subtraction of past sins but active creation of space for others’ stories. The glass orchard’s “integrated fragmentation” reweights the premise—broken pieces matter because they acknowledge breakage. Subtext resides in gesture: Vera uncorks moonlight instead of ink, silently rejecting her forged past. Final image of child writing offers non-literal answer without moralizing: origin is relational, not locational.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “clouds that moved like slow thoughts” sets perceptual signature of slowness against glass fragility. Syntax mirrors Vera’s caution—long sentences hold breath, then fracture into clauses like incised slate channels. No head-hopping; focalization stays interior to Vera. Patterned repetition (“clean slate” variations) is taught early and pays off in final line without cadence monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: moonlight bottle trades for prison poems, bracelet pulses arithmetic, child carries missing pages—each sentence layers world, backstory, stakes. Metaphors stay internally consistent (glass, light, fragmentation) without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates at child’s entrance, then releases into resonant final line that recharges “clean slate” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glass orchard + quantified parole + moonlight commerce feels fresh, not checklist. Transformation test fails if elements swapped—glass forgiveness and numeric parole are inseparable from theme. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is rewarded by coherent closure. Specific detail (“moons stacked three-deep”) prevents generic fantasy veneer.</comment>
