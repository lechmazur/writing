<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s lucid-dreamer vocation grants her a concrete, character-specific way to process grief, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“understanding dawns…”) rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure; the notebook decision lands as aftermath summary, not a micro-choice forged in the dome’s cold. The flaw costs the final beat full earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing—the inscription’s communal burden reweights every prior image—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is legible in Mira’s dawn exhale. One soft patch: the telegram’s “temple inscriptions” cue is unpacked only in exposition blocks, so the causal trigger arrives after the reflective lag, not inside the telescope action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory tools (groaning dome, tracking wheels, breath-fogged eyepiece) are tactile extensions of Mira’s body; the daylily telegram doubles as micro-setting that she fingers at stress points. Environment never crowds the beats—each detail routes straight to her charting task—yet nothing in the room physically obstructs or endangers her, so constraint stays moderate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode or be broken like Marcus—tightens cleanly once the star-flux pattern locks into temple glyphs; the single meaningful deepening is the moment Delta Cephei’s four-day heartbeat resolves into syntax, narrowing her options to publish or perish. Stakes remain conceptual; no concrete external obstacle escalates after that point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The communal burden theme emerges through stellar metaphor (distributed light-years of pain) and is repriced by the inscription; it avoids sermon by remaining encoded. No forced echo—objects (daylily, telegram) accrue meaning without overt symbolic speech—so resonance feels discovered, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mira’s perceptual filter—she hears the dome “groan in her bones,” reads petals by scent—maintaining rhythmic control that contracts under pressure. Free indirect slips once (“She understood now…”) but quickly re-anchors; diction stays within her lexicon, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is selective, never stacked in the high-pressure beat. One scaffold loop—“she wrote about… she wrote about…”—slows the penultimate paragraph; otherwise density is high and momentum clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing lucid-dream chronicle with variable-star cryptography yields a fresh angle on inherited trauma; the ancestor-code premise could feel gimmicky but is grounded in Mira’s vocation and embodied process. Risk stays measured—no formal experimentation—yet specificity of the daylily-telegram keeps the concept from feeling templated.</comment>
