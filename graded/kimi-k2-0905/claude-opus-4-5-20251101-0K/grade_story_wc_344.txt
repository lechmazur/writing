<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—she registers the lock through her fingertips, hesitates over the vial—but the contradictory impulses promised in the 9+ gate are only asserted (“understanding flooded”) rather than enacted in a beat where fear and desire coexist. The earned cost is present (she gives up the safety of indecision and releases the note), yet the mentor’s driftwood nostalgia is filtered through her summary rather than dramatized choice, so the flaw feels named, not lived. Still, her micro-choice to uncap is a visible pivot that forecloses retreat, satisfying the basic causality test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, mirrors, gears, and note layer into a cadence shift that reweights “repair” from restoration to transformation. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors stop fragmenting and reflect only present-wholeness—charged by the sustained note that makes the cost audible. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“Mira pressed her palm…”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. One soft spot: the prophecy scraps arrive late (~550 words) as an expository shortcut, but because they merely corroborate rather than enable the final choice, causality is not broken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating library’s cold grows “teeth,” the mirrors’ light has no source, and the gear wax is “old honey”—selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hand on door → seventh-floor hall → lectern corner → vial uncapped, each object materially constraining the next move. The clock-tower payoff below proves the setting’s resources alter outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: “clouds below” is repeated without evolving, a small static note.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightens when the vial threatens irreversible loss. Agency is interior but decisive: uncapping redefines the task from “fix” to “transform,” a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the note escapes, mirrors shatter frost, and the tower’s first tick implies perpetual responsibility she must now carry. No visible external price (bleeding finger, social exile) keeps it shy of the 8.8+ band where a sharper hurt is usually required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brokenness as creative space is first literal (mirrors, gears) then conceptual (accepting misfit pieces). The final image—clock tower ticking below—offers a non-literal answer: time restarts not because things are “fixed” but because they are re-imagined. No moral is stated; the refrain “driftwood nostalgia” recurs with shifted weight, now signifying forward motion rather than loss. The insight is earned through tactile struggle rather than announcement, avoiding thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual signature—she “feels the lock’s mechanism… like a memory refusing to dissolve.” Syntax mirrors her trained hand: precise, tactile, slightly ceremonious. No dialogue to distort voice; internal diction remains within her plausible lexicon. The sustained musical note momentarily compresses diction (“mirrors sing… shattered frost”) without breaking POV coherence, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is lyrically controlled: long sentences bloom in calm beats, then fragment under the note’s resonance (“What emerged was not smoke or light but sound”). Information density is high—each sentence layers image, memory, and concept without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“mirrors were hauntingly bright… mirrors shifted, showing…” within 40 words) triggers a −0.2; otherwise metaphors stay coherent. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith conceit is fresh yet grounded in tactile craft; the library above clouds literalizes “frozen memory” without becoming gimmick. Transformation test: the story collapses if you swap locksmith for generic thief—gear-feel and eclipse timing are integral. Risk is taken with the lyric, accumulative structure rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the resonant final tick. One echo of familiar “mirrors show past” trope is forgiven by the shift to inter-mirror harmonics.</comment>
