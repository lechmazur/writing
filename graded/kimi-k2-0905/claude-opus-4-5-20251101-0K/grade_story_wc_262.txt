<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s craving to “find where unused love is stored” is concrete and felt; her tactile handling of the projector and the film strip dramatizes a contradictory impulse to keep and to release. The psychic triangulation—curiosity, duty to grandmother, half-acknowledged fear of erasure—peaks in the unpowered threading of the Simplex, a micro-choice that costs her the possibility of literal retrieval. Interiority is embodied (“pressure building behind her temples like hushed thunder”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation is earned and scaled to length, but the strip’s earlier beats lean on summary rather than scene, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera realizes the booth is a place to plant, not harvest, and the last image of love “incubating in the dark” crystallizes before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held—density of remembered films, cork-swallowed whispers, hanging strips—until the final cadence shift. Causality is internal but coherent: because each object remembers, therefore the letters must be returned to matter, not taken from it. No orientation debt; spatial and psychic stakes remain legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered through usable detail—cool Simplex gate, cork walls that drank decades of whispers—every sense filtered by Vera’s professional eye for “psychometric architecture.” Micro-setting (the projector throat accepting celluloid) literally constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Economy is strong: no cinema-tour filler, only objects that remember or refuse to. Just short of 9.0 because one paragraph widens to the auditorium below without returning pressure to Vera’s hands-on task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release versus recovery of pooled love—tightens once, when Vera senses the room of hanging strips and recognizes the strip belongs there, not to her. The tightening is internal and sufficient for lyric length; cost is loss of the hoped-for retrieval, paid on-page (“tears cooling on her cheeks”). No coincidence, no external antagonist; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. Would climb higher if a mid-text micro-choice had risked tangible consequence (e.g., tearing the strip).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete repetitions of storage, projection, and unborn images; the ending reweights the premise so “unused love” is neither waste nor treasure but seed. Subtext lives in gesture—threading film like a rosary—without sermon. No final-paragraph thesis; the last line (“some doors close not as endings but as embraces”) is image, not moral. Complexity is honored: love remains unresolved yet re-homed, inviting counter-readings of surrender or continuation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filter; diction (“nitrate dreams,” “incubated hope”) is voice-specific without purple drift. Syntax breathes with the psychometry surge—long, clause-heavy sentences under pressure, then quiet declarative exits. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext alone. Rhythm control is secure enough for 9-band but one clause-string approaches 40 words near climax, slightly diluting punch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line craft is dense and propulsive: “Seeds of feeling pressed into fertile shadow” does double metaphoric and thematic work. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“luminous jungle,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by Vera’s cerebral sensorium. One near-simultaneity slip (“She opened her eyes...and though there was no power...she felt the machine accept”) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing psychometry with a cinematic reliquary for unvoiced love is fresh; the “room of hanging strips” image feels inevitable yet un-stolen. Conceptual risk—no antagonist, no dialogue, purely internal arc—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Details (celluloid preservation, 1959 married-projectionist taboo) are granular to this story only. Risk bonus applies: +0.3 for staking everything on lyric interiority and landing the reconfiguration.</comment>
