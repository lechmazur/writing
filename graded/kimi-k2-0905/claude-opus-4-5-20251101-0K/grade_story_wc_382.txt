<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interior growth from curious neighbor to inheritor of the building’s language is embodied through sensory micro-choices (pressing palm to wall, hearing morning stretches). The protagonist’s contradictory fear of and hunger for the uncanny stays active in scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of asking no questions about Elara’s death. Flaws—naïve trust, voyeuristic hunger—compound and are accepted in the final stasis with visible cost: lifelong custodianship of a haunted garden. Because Elara is already dead, relationship pressure is off-page; what remains is the crucible of successor vs. building, which satisfies the 600-word default.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator assumes the tutor mantle with the same opening line Elara used, crystallizing the before/after of inheritance. Cost is felt in the image of sugar stocks “no reasonable person needs” and the building’s expectant sigh—conceptual price of eternal custodianship. Accumulative lens holds: patterned tea/meteor/sugar cadence deepens to final reprise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Causality intact: because narrator listened, therefore building chose; because Elara faded, narrator remains—no reversals needed under lyric-accumulative design.</comment>

<comment>Rooftop garden, antique seal, and frost-bitten roses act as micro-setting that constrains choice: only here can the language lessons occur, only this seal certifies enrollment. Meteor shower supplies temporal urgency, its streaks “measuring borrowed time,” directly charging the final January image. Sensory hierarchy is narrator-obsessed: starlight on silver hair, taste of impossible winter bloom, chill of brass seal—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: fire-escape ascent, desk seal hand-off, garden perimeter all track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state—dormant roses under frost = Elara’s fading—yet avoids overt symbolism by keeping image in action (narrator still prunes them).</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—learn or lose the building’s dying language—signals in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: January meteor shower rare + Elara’s translucence = last chance to receive final lesson, foreclosing option to quit. Escalation is accretive, not causal: each monthly tea adds vocabulary, stakes rise as tutor fades. Cost legible on-page: narrator’s acceptance of sugar hoarding and eternal vigilance. No antagonist needed; pressure is existential erasure of knowledge. Under accumulative lens, pattern break (fading tutor) reweights inheritance from elective study to irreversible burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—languages survive by choosing their speakers—emerges through concrete recurrence of sugar/tea/meteor ritual, never stated until final paragraph where it is re-weighted as cost rather than moral. Subtext of gentrification/colonization hinted but left ambiguous: building’s memories vs. new tenants, dead cultures vs. living interpreter. No meta-commentary; insight earned via narrator’s calloused palms and sleepless sugar inventory. Final image of “borrowed sweetness that opens every door” offers non-literal answer: knowledge is gift that demands caretaker’s life. Complexity preserved—no stance on whether immortality-through-service is gift or curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: elevators sing, banisters deserve apologies, window glass holds memories—idiosyncratic, consistent. Compression taught early (“Everyone starts with sugar”) and paid off in final replication. Rhythm modulates: short declarative for uncanny sightings, longer lyrical coils for meteor paragraphs. No head-hopping; Elara’s interior accessed only via narrator’s embodied guesswork. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“I understood”) they mark actual epiphany. Register stays within narrator’s plausible diction—no corporate intrusion. Final cadence mirrors opening, creating purposeful symmetry without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer time-jump, sensory detail, and metaphor (“meteors measuring borrowed time”). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances mythos or image. Figurative language sparse, pattern-taught: “building’s morning stretches” appears once and recurs only when narrator can literally hear them. Mixed metaphors avoided; “secret language” sustained throughout. No scaffold; opening omits back-story dump, instead embeds Elara’s death in second sentence. Copy-clean: pronoun “her” always antecedents Elara; “it” always seal or building. Final line’s monosyllabic cadence provides deliberate breath after lyric swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—dead linguist teaches sentient-building archaeology via suburban sugar borrowing—is non-obvious synthesis of ghost story and urban fantasy. Trope of mentor ghost transformed: Elara is not here to resolve personal unfinished business but to perpetuate cultural preservation, a stakes inversion. Fresh inflection: architectural sentience conveyed through domestic minutiae (elevator lullabies, banister bruises) rather than grand hauntings. Risk of sentimentality avoided by admitting lies and cost. Specificity of Sanskrit/Sumerian crumbles vs. rooftop roses creates memorable friction. Pattern feels inevitable in hindsight yet un-written before; without sugar ritual entire emotional math collapses.</comment>
