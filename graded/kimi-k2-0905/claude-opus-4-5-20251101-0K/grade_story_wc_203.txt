<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is consistently concrete—her “skillfully observant” trait is shown through tactile detail like feeling the seam of the baseboard. The mainspring decision is earned via her established call to “discover what ceilings hide,” so the moment carries cost. The ghost’s backstory is summarized rather than embodied, keeping Eleanor abstract; this flattens the relational crucible. Still, Miriam’s micro-choice to carry the barrel out “heavy in her arms” crystallizes her stance, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Miriam’s decision to deliver the mainspring to the historical society is a Decisive Change that costs her professional neutrality. Causal chain holds—dust pattern → ghost cue → hidden panel → choice—without convenient amnesia. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 120 words; condemned 1987 circus office is clear. The reflective block (grandmother ghost) is one substantial block ~18% and tilts present stance, so BRR obeyed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard: peeling red paint, rusted turnstile, oilcloth-wrapped brass—each detail is filtered through Miriam’s technician gaze and guides her hands. The elevator shaft itself never constrains a choice, but the ticket-counter baseboard seam does, qualifying micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Fluorescent buzz death acts as a temporal hinge, re-weighting atmosphere at the exact beat the ghost appears.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing hidden truth versus walking away—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: ghost’s request narrows Miriam’s options from appraisal to preservation. Cost is present but soft—she merely amends her report; no credible loss (money, client, time) is dramatized. Agency is hers, yet the external pressure feels gentle; escalation obeys causal lens but lacks visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “cracks in the façade” emerges through the literal panel Miriam pries open and the metaphorical insurance injustice; no overt thesis statement. Subtext resides in the mainspring’s silence—craft erased by class bias. Final image of water-stain faces reweights earlier dust analysis without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: historical society may still ignore Eleanor; complexity is embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Miriam’s technician diction—“multimeter,” “mainspring barrel,” “oilcloth.” Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices dust thickness, spiral heart of metal, weight distribution. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Syntax is clean; occasional lyric lift (“wind through paper”) is ghost-permitted and brief. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. High information density: “ Dust lay thick… particles settled told stories…” does triple duty (setting, character skill, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph avoids sentimental closure; “weightless burden” is earned by prior weight imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ghost-technician pairing is fresh; circus horology subplot is specific. Mainspring as gendered erased craft offers non-obvious historical angle. Risk is moderate—quiet ghost story—but specifics (dust analysis as ghost detector) transform trope. Could swap locales with minor edits, so not fully irreplaceable, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
