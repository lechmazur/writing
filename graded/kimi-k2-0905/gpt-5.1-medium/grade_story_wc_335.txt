<question>1</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhea’s contradictory impulses—protective tenderness and tactical ferocity—are alive in every micro-choice: the heel-of-hand door-close, the blade-smile promise that forgetting Jun will hurt. Her interiority is concrete (“gut tightened,” “walks backwards when nervous”) and complicates action in real time. The final vow to “hold the exit open as long as my hands remember how” crystallizes a costed renunciation that is fully earned by the scene’s causal chain. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain consistent even at peak pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rhea’s promise reconfigures stakes while the reversible-exile rule persists with felt cost. The drive lens is situational-accumulative—pressure crystallizes stance rather than pivots plot—and holds without wobble. Orientation is taught early (“By the time Rhea found…”) and the final image of ink-fold shadows in glass reweights prior motifs. Cost is visible in the same breath as the promise, satisfying Q2’s 9+ cost-proof test.</comment>

<comment>The library is lived-in: dust motes mingle with steam, shards turn into “thin, dark reservoirs,” and the low table’s chipped cup constrains the tea-leaf ritual. Spatial choreography is clean—boot-echo aisle, west-wall mirrors, Jun behind the stack—anchoring bodies without white-room drift. The afternoon shadow caught in glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. While environment does not alter tactics mid-scene, it frames every choice and reprises at closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Jun’s exile will remain reversible—tightens when Rhea annotates the vellum bridge, narrowing options to her sole vigil. Escalation is driven by her agency under situational pressure: the Council’s decree stands, but her promise reweights the cost of remembering. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the price (perpetual guardianship of the exit) is legible on the page. Closure form is judged in Q2; here the pressure curve coheres and peaks with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as civic casualty, exile as deferred courage. Subtext lives in gesture—Rhea’s blade-smile, Jun’s snort that folds agreement and contempt—rather than exposition. The final promise offers a non-literal answer: pain is guaranteed, not as moral but as existential cost. Ambiguity lingers (will the city ever want Jun back?) and resonance arises from the shard-mirror image reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: “echoes hesitate,” “shadows…folding over themselves like ink in water,” diction filtered through Rhea’s archivist gaze. Compression (“bitter dusk-colored liquid,” “the hush as an empty playground swing”) is taught early and paid off in cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress without register drift. Dialogue carries subtext naturally, and rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat at most—and vehicles stay internally coherent (ink-in-water shadow, drawn-blade smile). Information density is high: each line advances atmosphere, stakes, or ritual mechanics. Zero scaffolding or redundancy in the closure third, keeping the prose artifact-free and eligible for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror archive and reversible exile are fresh syntheses, not stock dystopias. Risk is taken with the tea-leaf geometry divination, yet the ritual feels inevitable given the mirror-glass motif. Specificity—“slender brass spoon,” “jagged constellations of leaves”—anchors the concept in tactile detail. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional calculus collapses because the exile mechanism is inseparable from this city’s self-erasure.</comment>
