<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker’s interior contradiction—listening to lies with one side of his face, to unspoken regrets with the other—remains vivid and character-specific. His decision to whisper tactical honesty to the prophet is a micro-choice that visibly alters the city’s fate, paying a cost in exposure. The prophet’s “strangely honest” trait is shown through plain diction that stings, not told. Secondary figures (mother, merchant) are sketched with quick, embodied reactions that feed the kinetic parapet, so the cast pressure coheres even beyond the two leads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn reveals a “quiet, enduring wall” of echoes, a Charged Poise that forecloses forgetting. Causal linkage holds throughout—each denied truth literally grinds the buried parapet, and each honest acceptance stills it. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“inside the murmuring pavilion”) and never breaks. Cost is legible in the final image: the dunes “rested” and the parapet “slept,” a conceptual repricing that makes silence itself the earned prize.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pavilion’s silk walls that “sighed with every movement” and the kinetic parapet whose stones grind louder with each denial function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: the walker notices tremors in minds “like gusts along wire,” a selective, professional attention. Spatial choreography is clean—cable, clearing, tent city, dunes—never floating. The final image recharges the earlier “whisperfield calm,” now crystallized into an environmental wall that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will denial keep grinding the city toward swallowing?—is signaled early and tightens when the cable lurches after the merchant’s denial. One meaningful deepening: the walker realizes honesty must be shaped, not merely scattered; this reframes tactics and slows the parapet. Agency is the walker’s whispered intervention; cost is the city’s near-collapse and the perpetual vigilance implied by the new “wall” of echoes. Coincidence never resolves; escalation is purely accumulative under the lens of collective honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between honesty and civic stability: denial literally moves stone, acceptance stills it. Subtext operates in the half-mask’s asymmetry and the merchant’s silent ledger-building. The final image reweights the premise—wisdom’s echo becomes the city’s defensive wall—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the walker must keep walking, suggesting vigilance is endless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-fabulist yet controlled: “wind that tasted of iron,” “border of others’ thoughts.” Syntax mirrors perception—long, breeze-like sentences for calm, abrupt fragments when the cable lurches. Peripheral awareness is both subject and stylistic filter, sustaining perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prophet’s interior is only inferred, keeping focalization clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Mixed metaphors are few and purposeful—“fold sound into itself” is brief, not cluttered. No template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density is high: one sentence often anchors setting, stakes, and sensory detail simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet as geological lie-detector is a fresh, non-obvious conceit; transformation test fails if swapped with generic earthquake. Half-mask that listens to lies vs. regrets synthesizes psychic wire-walking with civic engineering, making the concept inseparable from this world. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the dawn wall of echoes feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. No close echoes of famous scenes; the combination of wire-walker + truth-powered masonry + whisperfield is singular.</comment>
