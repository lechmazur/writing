<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ira’s quiet obsession with “why flowers bloom at night” is concrete and embodied in paint-stained fingers; his decision to sketch murals that will smuggle the cathedral’s secret back into alleyways crystallizes a value hierarchy (art as confession vs. observer’s solitude) with visible cost—he forfeits sole possession of the answer. Interior contradiction is present but thin: we are told he trusts “stories” yet never watches him doubt that trust under pressure. The earned renunciation lands, yet the micro-choice that seals it (unfolding the sketchbook rather than speaking) is slightly under-dramatized, keeping the score just outside the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ira’s sketches re-route the cathedral’s hidden optics into public walls, a conceptual repricing that costs him exclusive knowledge and charges the final “umbral tenderness.” Causal chain holds—postcard → Liora → gallery climb → etched-glass epiphany → artistic dissemination—each step narrows his options from private knowledge to shared witness. Orientation is clean by line 10; no lens ambiguity. The only minor drag is a single paraphrase loop (“dawning hush” repeated with identical weight), not enough to breach the 9+ gate but enough to hold the score at 8.7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The etched window itself functions as micro-setting: its vine-shadows physically map where night soil must lie, directly constraining Ira’s tactical realization and later mural placement. Selective sensory triage—ink-and-match scent, low-angle sun sliding “like water through layered rock”—mirrors Ira’s painterly attention without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his body up the narrow stair and back down to the nave. Environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; only a hairline repetition of “dawning hush” keeps it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the night flowers”—tightens when Ira realizes the glass lenses must be reproduced off-site, forcing him to trade private mastery for public dissemination; this single meaningful turn forecloses hoarding the secret. Pressure is coherent under situational lens: the cathedral’s architecture is the immutable circumstance that channels his agency into art rather than botany. Cost is legible—he surrenders sole witness—but the beat is compressed into one sentence, slightly muting the visceral price. Still, escalation is clean and lens-consistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: secrecy as caretaking vs. secrecy as solitude; the final mural diffusion reframes knowledge as communal light rather than private possession. No character moralizes; the reweighting is performed by the image of painted rooftops “like secret constellations.” Ambiguity lingers—will public blooms survive scrutiny?—yet the thematic arc is fully resolved through Ira’s sacrificed exclusivity. No late symbolic grafts; the window’s optics carry the conceptual freight from first mention to last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to Ira’s painterly perceptual signature—color as confession, shadows as pigment—without head-hopping. Syntax modulates from longer observational sentences in the gallery to clipped fragments at the reveal (“Night would tilt those shadows…”), mirroring cognitive acceleration. Liora’s dialogue carries faint ecclesiastical cadence (“paint remembers what stone forgets”) distinct from Ira’s chromatic idiom; convergence at closure is intentional and brief. No filter-verb stacks; elisions (“stone ribs catching the pale sun”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “light entered at a low angle, sliding through the etched glass like water through layered rock” performs metaphorical work without mixed vehicles. Only one adjacent paraphrase (“dawning hush” echo) appears; it does not touch the closure beat. Information multiplexing is high—each sentence advances image, character perception, and causal logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Clean copy, precise punctuation, and strong paragraph cuts that would alter charge if removed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of medieval optics, nocturnal botany, and street-art evangelism feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; the cathedral window as covert lens array is a fresh angle on the “secret garden” trope. Risk is taken—quiet climax via architectural shadow rather than overt confrontation—and the piece commits fully, never retreating to explanatory safety. Specificity of the amber pavilion in false autumn embeds the uncanny as climate fact rather than ornament. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
