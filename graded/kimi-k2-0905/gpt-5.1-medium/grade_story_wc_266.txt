<comment>Mara’s panic and the “gently persistent ache” that keeps her climbing are concrete and embodied; the contradictory pull between filial guilt and self-assertion stays active in-scene. The star punched into her reads as an externalization of an earned, costly first step rather than a magic fix. Yet her interiority dips into diagnostic shorthand (“she did not name it courage, only necessity”) that slightly blurs the visceral contradiction in the moment of assent.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star sinks into her and the sea-hum becomes a held note, making the before/after of accepting passage legible with felt cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each remembered cowardice deposits a physical step, tightening the allegorical descent. Orientation is swift; who/where/when is anchored by word 90. The lens holds; no late rule changes.</comment>

<comment>Harbor mist, cliff-scree, tarred beams, and the shell-colored door are selectively filtered through Mara’s urgency; the walkway is “slick with mist,” forcing her hesitation that dramatizes stakes. Sensory economy favors touch and kinesthetic detail over visual catalog. The veiled ridgeway and muttering under-house sea function as micro-setting objects that constrain her path and charge the final lullaby hum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom from the family shop—tightens when each remembered self-betrayal converts into a literal downward step, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: density of memories = depth descended; cost is the burning lungs and the audible sea that replaces breathing room with irrevocable onward pressure. One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of un-used courage emerges from sensory particulars (swallowed classroom words, brochure under pillow) rather than thesis statements. Final shoreline lullaby reweights all prior silent suppressions into a single held note, achieving resonance without moral tag. Subtext in ferry guides’ gnomic dialogue implies crossings beyond water, letting metaphor stay porous. Avoids sermon; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close on Mara maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors maritime, weather-worn diction (“salt,” “tar,” “tide-line curve”). Syntax lengthens during descent to mirror breath-control, then fractures into single-image clauses at star-punch. No POV leakage; guides remain externally observed, preserving mystery. Dialogue indirection sustains subtext rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts around the punch-moment for propulsion. Metaphors stay maritime-consistent and mutually reinforcing; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one sentence can layer setting, kinesthetic detail, and memory. Minor filter-verb trio (“she saw… she saw…”) in memory cascade dulls immediacy slightly but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “threshold guardian ferry” trope is refreshed by inland stair-descent and star-punch that literalizes ticket, plus elder guides who ferry interior seas. Specificity of shop-jar inventory, brochure under pillow, and shell-colored door roots universals in lived particulars. Risk taken: lyrical allegory that could feel abstract yet stays tethered to tactile pressure. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
