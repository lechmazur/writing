<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s grief-riven listening is concretely embodied (“reed-blown melancholy,” the trembling shell) and her final acceptance is earned through a causal chain of canyon tests; the interior contradiction between blame and need is alive in scene. Micro-choices (kneeling, lowering the flute, lifting the shell again) visibly re-weight her values. Flaw: no second on-page character, so relationship/status crucible and secondary pressure bullets are N/A—minor ceiling only. “Grief sharpened…loosened” skirts diagnostic label-speak but is saved by immediate physical correlative, so −0.3 not −0.6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s “debts” reframe Liora’s blame into custodianship; cost is the unrecoverable sister-pattern, felt in the shell’s surf-sound. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each echo-layer thickens meaning until the final cadence shift reconfigures stakes. Orientation crisp by 40 words; no teleporting props; no因果 breaks. One scaffold loop (“voices…voices…voices”) in third-last paragraph dulls the image fractionally, preventing 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon as pressure chamber is tactile: stone “throat,” “tongue,” grit-bearing wind; spatial choreography clean as Liora pivots from rim to kneel to rise. Shell functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice (she “lifted the shell” to hear surf). Sensory hierarchy matches singer’s ear-centric worldview. Meets 9+ gate: environment (canyon body) charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some voices vanish—signaled line 1; escalation via echo-tests that progressively strip illusion; final tightening forecloses vengeance, replaces it with custodial song. Cost is legible: she放弃追索妹妹完整的回音，接受保管残响的责任。Agency present in every musical probe; no coincidence resolves. Could use one earlier tangible loss (water spent? bone flute crack?) to push past 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echo-as-debt emerges through overlapping voices, not thesis: “Their echoes were not rewards… but debts.” Final image reweights shell from fracture-token to listening-instrument, offering resonant answer without moral. Avoids tidy closure by leaving the canyon still hungry. Subtext in silence after “wind shuffled down the ravine” carries unspoken cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature: auditory metaphors (“universe hums its secret song”), syntax that mirrors breath-held listening. Patterned elision (“half a shell, half a sister, half a question”) is taught early and paid off in final shell-to-ear moment. No head-hopping; diction stays within singer’s mythic yet intimate register. Rhythm modulates from circling flute phrases to stark single-sentence realization, heightening pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers mythic physics (“canyon became a throat”) while advancing test-phase. Metaphors are coherent (stone=memory bank) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“voices…voices” anaphora) is purposeful choral effect, not artifact. Final line “reed-blown melancholy” re-seeds opening diction, creating closure echo—precise craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar grief-quest trope and reframes it through acoustics-of-memory mythology; canyon-as-archive feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: reader must assemble meaning from echo-layers, mirroring protagonist. Transformation test: could not swap canyon for forest or sea without breaking core logic. Specific infraction: “reed-blown melancholy” and shell-as-earpiece are memorable, non-generic images.</comment>
