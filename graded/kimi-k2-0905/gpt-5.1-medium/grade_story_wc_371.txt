<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is dramatized through the undramatic—he carries, unwraps, and finally shares the bread instead of heroic protest. The tea mistress’s heuristically gentle gait and soft demolition of absolution myths apply immediate status pressure, forcing him to test his self-image. Interior contradiction—guilt vs. complicity—is kept alive inside every tactile choice (dip bread, breathe steam) without therapeutic labels. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the path of quiet witnessing is accepted, but the cost (lingering guilt, no absolution) is tasted in the last crumb.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: pattern of noticing > sharing > witnessing culminates in Charged Poise—the bread’s dissolution reweights “quiet complicity” with undeniable sensory cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) delivered by line 4, no penalty. Causality is lyric-retroactive: each sensuous micro-choice (unwrap, tear, dip) escalates meaning, not danger, and the final image crystallizes options without outline chatter. Closure beat is visibly felt: “warmth still rises…defiantly” makes the cost breathable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment acts as coercive tool: rust-filled joints between tiles dictate tentative steps; steam from kettle becomes breathable proxy for absolution; cracked marble forces the low, cross-legged stance of confession. Every descriptor passes through POV filter of micro-decay, showing palimpsest geometry rather than postcard scenery. The courtyard’s living map—fig roots splitting balustrades—mirrors protagonist’s recognition that neglect has grown around him. Final image of defiant steam uses setting as micro-charged object, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to respond to unnoticed erasure—tightens through sensory intensification: crust softens, gardens colonize stone, steam thickens. Protagonist agency is attentional: each act of witnessing (unwrap, offer, swallow) narrows his available stance; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence (last bread on doorstep) complicates but does not resolve; tension remains internal. Cost is sequential and palpable: from intact loaf > collapsed dome > dissolved crumb, a visible ledger of unearned guilt consumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “quiet complicity as its own decay” emerges concretely: the bread ages quietly while city forgets, courtyard overgrows, and absolution is explicitly “not on the menu.” Subtext operates in gesture—sharing the bread equals admission of shared guilt, done without overt statement. Final image re-prices witnessing itself; no moral sermon, only embodied warmth that costs him settled despair. Multiple counter-readings possible (is sharing cowardice or courage?) yet no confusion lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s perceptual engine: synesthetic noticing (yeast-smell=question, steam=absolution) creates distinct idiom. Compression and elision (“he is waiting…”) are taught early and paid off when the waiting ends in communal swallow. No head-hop; tea mistress’s interiority is inferred solely through her heuristically gentle steps and tonally soft commands. Rhythm accelerates microscopically during tear/dip beats, mirroring pulse of reluctant confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high-density, low-scaffold: each sentence layers image + interiority + world fact (“feral camellias root in broken pots”). Metaphors stay physically faithful—steam currents mirror thought currents with no mixed logic. Occasional elevated phrase (“braided into the cold air like a question”) fits reflective register and is earned. No loops, paraphrase, or filter-verb stacks; final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: combines creeping normality, guerrilla gardening, and bread relic into an emotional “quiet apocalypse” that feels new yet inevitable. Risk in low-action lyric mode heightens intimacy without gimmickry. Familiar motif of vanished bakery is re-animated through sensory haunting rather than nostalgia shorthand. Specificity carries universality—any city reader recognizes blackout-painted windows—yet no other story would use this exact crumbling tea-house ritual.</comment>
