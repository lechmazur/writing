<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lysa’s interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, the act of tracing leaf-vein gaps—contradictory impulses (rewrite past vs. accompany brother) coexist in the final beat. Her “carefully resourceful” trait is not label-only: it drives the renegotiation with the clerk and the marginal inscription that rewrites the rescue mission. The brother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; the single-POV default is met. Closure choice is earned: the marginal note grows new veins, foreclosing erasure while accepting cost—an Earned Stasis visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the traveler scatters the archive, Lysa maps the absences; because she offers repair labor, the clerk grants conditional entry; because she writes in the margin rather than the center, the rescue mission is re-scripted without erasing regret. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the book’s page re-veins itself, making the price of her refusal irreversible yet generative. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; no debt. One transition—desk to spiral descent—is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore is not postcard backdrop: its “phosphorescent indexes” and “shelves that grow crooked” physically guide Lysa’s gap-mapping; the circular chamber of blank books constrains her final choice. Micro-setting too—the botanical diary’s pressed leaf veins—functions as map-tool that charges the ending when she replicates vein-structure in her marginal note. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: arcane linguist notices grammars, shelving codes, ink states. Spatial choreography is clean: table → western stacks → colder corridors → circular chamber; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve brother by translating her unlearned mistake—is signaled early and tightens when the clerk demands “one lesson someone else failed to learn,” forcing her to choose whose failure she’ll study. Escalation is causal: each gap mapped narrows her path; the blank-spine book bearing her brother’s name makes the cost personal and immediate. The final micro-turn—writing in margin, not center—renounces erasure and accepts parallel futures, a visible trade-off. Price is legible: the mountain keeps her exit conditional, the book rewrites itself, she defers reunion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particular absence—gaps in shelves, in language, in regret—rather than abstract statement. The unheard symphony motif modulates: early it is ambient awe, at the end it is the unheard future chorus she joins with her brother, reconfiguring rescue from solo to duet. No final moralizing; the margin note is action, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: the new veins may still choke, but the choice accepts that risk, rendering wisdom earned rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Lysa; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is linguist-specific: “extinct grammars,” “half-born scripts,” “ shelving codes that did not exist.” Syntax mirrors compression under pressure—“She spent hours charting…”—then lengthens for the chamber reveal. Dialogue is sparse but voice-motivated: clerk’s “Rescue missions always cost more” carries subtext of withheld melody. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within arcane-linguist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences world-build (“shelves spiraled up tunnels, crossed stone bridges”) while advancing movement. Figurative language is selective—“unheard symphony,” “paper-cut eyes”—and never clutters the final beat. Rhythm accelerates into the circular chamber then slows for the one-page choice, creating cadence shift. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence either maps, reveals, or costs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line “adding a rescue mission to the shelves” recharges leaf-vein motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “library of unlearned lessons” is not mere metaphor but a navigable space whose blank books demand future inscription; the botanical diary’s pressed leaves as map is fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in structure—accumulative gap-map rather than linear quest—heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. The twist that rescue means accompanying into uncertainty rather than rewriting the past feels inevitable once the margin-note option is seeded. Specific lived detail—ink on catalog cards, shimmer of unwritten ink—prevents abstraction; the premise could not survive relocation to generic fantasy shelves.</comment>
