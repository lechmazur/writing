<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—terror vs longing—are dramatized in the body (shaking hands → steady hands) and charge the surrender beat. The final stance ("direction had stopped hiding") is earned by the prior spiral of dust that empties the skull and stains the valley. Cost is felt, not just named; renunciation of safety is visible in lying down on cold stone. misses 9.0 only because interiority edges toward lyrical self-diagnosis ("shadowed rapture") rather than raw sensation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the astrolabe tunnels the aurora, the protagonist’s unwritten sentence empties into the valley, and the price is the ringing hollow in his skull. Causal linkage holds—each traced star tightens the internal noose until surrender is the only option. Orientation is swift ("the first time I stood...") and anchors hold. No breaks, no soft resets; the ending image reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Keystone spiral, brass astrolabe, and aurora curtain function as micro-setting—each constrains the next move and charges the final transparency. Sensory economy is disciplined: cold-metal taste, muffled sky-sighs, ink-dark tunnel. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the protagonist never floats. Only the valley’s off-stage roofs keep it from 9.0—needed one tactile return beat to prove the ideas really landed on cobble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—"loosen trapped ideas or be strangled"—tightens with every falling star that stitches another word into the skull-sentence. The turn is the realization that the backlog is his own; options collapse into surrender. Under Accumulative lens, density of unspoken words becomes unbearable until release. Cost is visible: the emptied ringing replaces pressure, foreclosing the old avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of rest: sleep denied for creative exorcism, rest redefined as direction found through self-emptying. No moralizing; the final quiet sky is the answer. Recurring spiral and stardust reweight at closure, making the personal backlog cosmic. Complexity is honored—the same act is liberation and vandalism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric is stable, with perceptual signature of someone who hears pauses between sounds. Syntax grows leaner as pressure peaks ("I lay down...") matching the emptying. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor stays within physical logic of ink, metal, breath. Voice is distinct and unborrowed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence carries image + pressure + mythic register without purple drift. Rhythm breathes—long breath-like clauses early, shorter exhalations at climax. Only one paraphrase loop ("falling stars traced final bright scars" is echoed in spirit a beat later) prevents 9.0. Otherwise zero loops, zero mixed metaphor, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: aurora as breathing sky, astrolabe that charts nights that never officially existed, creativity as invasive dust storm. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting cosmic imagery carry the climax—pays off because the emotional stakes were grounded in bodily terror. Specificity throughout keeps it from reading as mere lyric exercise.</comment>
