<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ansel’s solitary, obsessive precision is vivid—his soot-dark hands, the patient heel-toe walks, the private smile when the rusted bell answers. Interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized: we’re told he stayed “because his craft had never been about work, but about weight and answer,” yet no moment shows him tempted to quit or admit doubt. The micro-choice to reverse his path and match the same tempo is concrete and character-specific, earning the town’s first shiver. Cost is present but soft: infinite patience is asserted, not tested to a visible limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of two sets of footsteps synchronizing under the arch reconfigures the town’s possibilities and carries undeniable felt cost—return, exposure, shared risk. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly walks deposit rhythm into the tuning fork, pattern breaks when the wagon arrives, cadence shift charges the ending. Causality is poetic but coherent—each footstep literally stores pressure that the fork converts into bell-resonance, a rule taught early and paid off. Orientation is clean: fog-thinned cobblestones and cracked windows anchor who/where/when within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: the archway acts as resonator, cobblestones as tuning teeth, fog as hush that listens. The ebony fork is handled repeatedly, its light-swallowing surface and wrist-strike mechanics specific and evolving. Micro-setting qualifies—the fork, stone, and shutter form a tactile circuit that constrains Ansel’s method and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound-as-weight, a professional tuner’s perception that makes “kindly iron suns” and “rusted vowel of surprise” feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: rebuild the town’s sense of time so people feel the pull to return. Escalation is accumulative—each night’s walk thickens the auditory palimpsest until bells hum along; the wagon’s arrival is the pattern-break that forces stance crystallization. Protagonist agency drives every increment: he chooses the footstep method, alters pace by heartbeats, reverses path to test echo. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral—years of nightly walks, infinite patience—yet it tightens options and forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of collapse: balance is not structural but acoustic—time kept by shared cadence. The bells’ cracked chorus reweights “revival” from population to resonance; people return not for commerce but because the hours feel right. Subtext operates in gesture: the tuning fork’s silence is consent, the shutter’s twice-clap is applause for nothing. Final image offers no moral, only a charged poise—two hearts walking in time under an arch that once admitted horses and now admits possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, focalized through Ansel’s tuner-biased perception: he notices echo, weight, interval, not faces. Syntax is purposefully cadenced—parallel “heel toe, heel toe” teaches the pattern; compression in “the fog listened” mirrors the fork’s mute vibration. Diction stays within a quiet craftsman’s lexicon; elevated metaphors (“kindly iron suns,” “stone remembering a dream”) are justified by his lifelong immersion in bell-time. No dialogue appears; voice carries subtext through silence and sonic image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “dust hung where voices used to gesture” collapses sight and sound into one line. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is selective, never clustered in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors are avoided—fork as shut eye, bell as rusted vowel, all consistent with sound-as-memory logic. Final line “the work of revival finally began” is plain, letting the image resonate rather than overwrite.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ghost-town and bell-tuner tropes into a fresh acoustic resurrection engine: revival via footfall tempo rather than commerce or infrastructure. The tuning fork that swallows light and stores rhythm is a specific, non-portable invention that charges closure. Risk is taken in withholding overt conflict—no antagonist, no belligerent river authority—yet pressure remains legible under accumulative lens. Synthesis feels inevitable: footsteps成为ghost-town的节拍器，a logic no other story could swap out intact.</comment>
