<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s perceptual gift and occupational lens are vivid and consistent; the decision to touch the mainspring is credibly driven by his curiosity and the children’s silent plea. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The flaw: we are told the ghosts cluster but their individual agendas stay flat, so the relational crucible never ignites; the boy’s cloudy eye is memorable yet does not complicate the final choice. Still, the micro-choice to read dust and the costly sight of the upside-down room land as earned, visible consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the ceiling treaty ruptures, the living world is now literally porous, and the narrator’s hand on the barrel is the irreversible signature. Causality under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every detail (dust ring, pulsing bulge, fluorescent death) accretes until the membrane tears. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The price is felt—“silence settled, thick and specific”—yet the narrator’s personal stake beyond professional curiosity could be sharper, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory economy nails the abandoned midway: “cracked plaster,” “elevator grease” cold on breath, the brass barrel’s polished circle. The ticket office functions as micro-setting—its ceiling becomes the inverted floor that reconfigures reality. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and distances track cleanly as the narrator kneels, the boy leans, the bulge swells directly overhead. The final image of mirrored elevator doors charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the bulge breathes. The single meaningful intensification (touching the barrel) forecloses retreat and is driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible: the upside-down room appears, ghosts exhale in relief, and the narrator is now complicit in a breached reality. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so it stops short of the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: ceilings as social contracts, facades as living membranes, maintenance as liminal negotiation. No overt thesis statements; the final image of inverted doors reweights the premise without moralizing. The motif of “cracks” recurs only as lived rupture, not symbol grafted late. Ambiguity lingers—are the ghosts liberated or is the narrator now trapped above himself?—inviting reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is sardonic, tactile, mechanically precise: “weightless burden,” “slow-motion film of use and neglect.” Syntax mirrors the POV’s trade—short clauses for tools, long sinuous sentences for ghostly atmosphere. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: dust grains read like forensic narrative, fluorescent hum becomes “entrails” pulled from wires. No head-hop, no register drift; even the boy ghost’s murmur feels ventriloquized through elevator grease chill.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “Dust thicker at the back than the front meant someone had visited recently” simultaneously reveals method, stakes, and time. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final breach—“the ceiling above us gave way with the soft, fibrous sigh of tape ripping from cardboard”—without overwriting. Minor hedge: “like someone flips a membrane instead of a switch” is the only near-cliché, but it is brief and functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ghost-seeing elevator tech premise is familiar, yet the mainspring barrel as the literal heart of an upside-down circus clock room feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Fresh synthesis: maintenance manuals meet liminal treaty theory. Risky structural inversion (whole second room) lands cleanly because dust forensics pre-lay the physics. The final image could echo Borges or Garcia Márquez, but the voice and occupational lens keep it singular.</comment>
