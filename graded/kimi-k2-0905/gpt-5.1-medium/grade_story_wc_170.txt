<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and painter-specific—“borrowed heartbeat” and prism-wet glass sight—yet choices remain observational until the girl appears; final joint song crystallizes a stance with visible cost, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens taught early; lyric shards layer visions until the girl’s arrival tightens to a direct plea; closure is a resonant reconfiguration—mirrors briefly re-priced, payment acknowledged—delivered with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terrace, rain-bead prism, and city-dark mirrors act as micro-setting tools that literally bend light and choice; parapet droplets are handled twice and return as color-corridors that enable the final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mirrors must show possibilities—escalates as song requests rise; girl’s plea narrows options to one mirror-repair; price is the acknowledged interest on borrowed heartbeat; causal agency stays with painter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of soft futures versus fixed fate emerges through refracted light and children’s dreams; no moralizing—final image of boy turning from river reweights earlier river-mirror dread with quiet hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, textured third-person hovers at painter’s perceptual edge—syntax wavers like heat-mirage, tense stable; perceptual signature (“light seen through wet glass”) sustains with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High figurative density is patterned early and paid off; minor loop risk in “mirror / silver / light” clusters but cadence breathes with scene rises; no mixed metaphors, strong verbs anchor each sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing light-bending painter, borrowed-clock-heart, and lullaby code into one quietly magical system feels fresh; city-terrace as dream-cinema is specific and memorable; risk heightens lyric coherence without gimmick.</comment>
