<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lysa’s interior contradiction—professional detachment colliding with private grief—surfaces in the skiff, embodied in her fierce yet careful grip on the shard. The brother’s final micro-choice (pride clamping tongue) is dramatized inside her vision, not summarized, so motivation ramifies. Cost is visible: she returns without absolution, only a “fragile map,” and the stone’s quietened pulse signals the transfer of burden. The only hairline slip is the abstract “arrogance of thinking pain could be tidily translated,” a minor therapy-speak shimmer in an otherwise concrete arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “I was afraid” reweights every prior condensation-letter and the client’s unsent stack, forcing a before/after on the living. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of song, mist, and shard pulses tightens until the final pane crystallizes the stalled apology. Causality is intact: the shard’s salt-vein hunger literally summons the spirits and pays off in the brother’s surfaced motive. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 40 words and the taught disorientation (labyrinth rules) resolves into the closure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop; its breathing green wounds and root-ribs physically cage the drowned brother, forcing Lysa to pole a narrow channel that mirrors the claustrophobic moment before speech fails. The gargoyle shard functions as micro-setting—its salt-vein constrains her wrist and decides when regret is thick enough to proceed. Spatial choreography is flawless: the skiff, pane of air-water, and mist-figure positions track cleanly across the rewind. Moonlight-heal is economical world-rule taught early and obeyed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the split breath before the brother’s drowning—tightens through accretion of song-sharpening and shard-flares, not multiple reversals. The single deepening comes when the unfinished sentence shortens to three words, narrowing the client’s future options: speak or burn. Agency remains Lysa’s; her decision to touch the pane triggers the vision that reweights the apology. Cost is felt in her ragged breath and the quieter shard—visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: apology as a living mangrove that keeps growing until words are spoken or sacrificed. No moral is stated; the final cradle-song for a “long delayed truth” lets the reader feel the cost of withheld speech. Subtext operates in gesture—the mist figure smearing the pane is both erasure and underlining—creating dramatic irony because we see the fear the brothers never voiced. The shard’s shift from aching tooth to quiet stone re-prices centuries of storm-taste into private grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cryptic, its syntax tidal: clauses wash forward, lap back, mirroring lagoon motion. Compression (“gusts of vowels that fog the edges of hearing”) teaches the reader to float in elision; payoff arrives when the same sonic blur resolves into the three stark words. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lysa notices salt, algae, crab-clicks because her trade is tasting unspoken weather. No head-hopping; even the brother’s sway is filtered through her embodied vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to the staccato “I was afraid.” Information density is high: one sentence often layers metaphor, action, and world-rule (“phosphorescent algae painted every trunk with breathing green wounds that healed in moonlight”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each metaphor is fresh yet physically coherent. The final line’s hush between wave-slaps is a deliberate decrescendo that recharges the cradle-song motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The apology-as-mangrove and memories-as-condensation-windows transform familiar ghost-story tropes into a singular ecology. Risk is taken: retrograde rewind of crabs and roots could have slid into gimmick, but it pays off by exposing the unspoken sentence. Synthesis feels inevitable: cathedral storm-taste, crab-click lullaby, and client’s collapsed face braid into one insight—fear not hate drowned the brother. Fresh inflection: the medium’s payment is not coin but architectural detritus that literally tasted history.</comment>
