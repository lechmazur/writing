<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Narrator’s urbane-calligrapher persona is vivid—ink dries fastest when people below are on fire—but micro-choices under pressure are thin; the “reverse confession” turn is declared rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Interior contradiction is present yet abstract; embodied emotion peaks early then yields to lecture. The final stance is credible, but the ache Lily’s version should have cost him is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (lyric-accumulative) is taught early and held: the campfire stick’s weight gathers across beats until the closing “orbit.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—stories choose to orbit rather than escape—reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clean; radar dome anchors who/where within 60 words. Slight causal slippage: puppet-show backstory is summarized, not shown, so the ethical pivot leans on exposition, but it doesn’t break the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<comment>The decommissioned radar dome is not backdrop; its “blind eye” and retired-dish groan constrain the final image, making silence an active antagonist. Micro-setting (ash stick, mezzanine rail) doubles as tool and moral fulcrum. Sensory economy is tight—meteor hush is heard, felt, then re-weighted. Spatial choreography is flawless across the curved wall.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“can stories expose their own cruelty”—is signaled early and tightens through the stick-handoff ritual. One meaningful deepening: admitting silence is the cruelest author narrows options to co-telling. Cost is legible—pride of detachment is forfeited—but external stakes (bar audiences, townspeople) remain off-page, capping intensity.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: ethical storytelling as stain-management, not purity. Subtext lives in gesture—setting the stick across the rail equals surrender of narrative monopoly. Final image reweights “orbit” as shared contamination, sidestepping moralizing. Insight is earned through the failed-documentary confession, not thesis statement.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a calligrapher’s perceptual signature—negative space, ink, serifed silence—without sliding into pastiche. Prose breathes with variable cadence; meteor hush compresses syntax while argument ashes lengthen sentences. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts sensibly under pressure. Register stays within urbane but wounded lexicon.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary from participial to clausal without falling into template. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. One paraphrase loop (“stories stain…patterns the stain reveals”) is forgiven because it functions as refrain. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles near closure.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Radar-dome writing school and puppet-show confessional fuse into a non-obvious ethics laboratory. Stick-as-torch-pass reverses typical talking-piece trope by making misrepresentation the win-condition. Risk-taking—the entire climax is a meta-storytelling game—pays off without gimmickry. Freshness lies in synthesis, not surface novelty.</comment>
