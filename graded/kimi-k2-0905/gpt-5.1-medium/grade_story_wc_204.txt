<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilen’s contradictory impulses—obedience to library warnings vs. irrepressible drive to compress eternity—are dramatized in the frost-copying scene and the lever-pull, each micro-choice visibly raising cosmic cost. Interiority stays concrete (“eternity was still uncompressed and echoing everywhere”) rather than abstract; the final stance crystallizes with felt forfeiture as “eternity folding gracefully” accepts perpetual instability. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; motive remains singular yet sufficiently strained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the printed page rewrites causality treaties, re-weighting reality’s rule-set while Ilen smiles “without triumph,” cost felt in the librarians’ stretched voices and the shelving-by-feeling decree. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each printed page destabilizes systems, frost patterns accumulate toward the spiral sentence, and the final luminous page compresses all library days into one shared moment, tightening cadence rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught early (“The glass orchard library floated…”) and anchors remain stable; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard, brass letterpress, and bottled whisper each constrain tactics: frost patterns literally dictate typesetting, the press’s “revolving moons” limit layout options, and the emptied bottle’s fogged glass visually signals spent possibility in the closing image. Cloud-sea altitude, sideways-turning wing, and prismatic light are not postcard scenery; they react to the printed page, forcing librarians to renegotiate shelving policy. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Ilen’s artisan attention—ink, brass, frost, translucent paper—grounding abstraction in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—eternity compressed without rupture—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when frost writes NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS, converting abstract desire into concrete deadline. Escalation is Accumulative: each printed sheet increases systemic wobble until the final page rewires treaties; cost is visible in glass branches chiming “like distant cutlery” and cloud-sea climbing with alien colors. Agency stays with Ilen: he copies frost, uncorks whisper, pulls lever; librarians merely react, preserving coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—time’s negotiability demands continual re-shelving of certainty—emerges through spiral frost → printed spiral page, never lectured. Subtext lives in the whisper’s silence and the librarians’ “rulebooks whose pages kept reordering,” implying knowledge systems are fragile performatives. Final image of shelving by feeling offers non-literal answer reframing earlier cataloging obsession, satisfying CR without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person close clings to Ilen’s perceptual filter: “ink-stained finger,” “tasted like falling,” maintaining artisan diction. Sentence rhythm mimics press mechanics—short clauses build tension before lever-pull, then elongate into luminous after-image. No head-hops; librarians’ panic filtered through Ilen’s awareness. Metaphors (“glass trees heavy with translucent books”) are internally consistent, never jarring against established physics of negotiable reality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “equations unraveled, clocks forgot” packs three system failures into five words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or image. Mixed-metaphor guard passed—spiral/merges gracefully with grammatical sentence. Minor −0.1 for two adjectival triplets (“deliberate, grammatical elegance”; “shallow dream”) that slightly delay peak beat, but these do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Floating glass-library-as-press premise feels inevitable yet fresh; concept commits fully without explanatory padding. Frost as typesetting manual and bottled silence as ink catalyst transform familiar writerly anxiety into cosmic editorial stakes. Risky abstraction is grounded through sensory tool use; no retreat into safe realism. Final re-shelving by emotion reconfigures genre expectation, making the piece memorable beyond its conceit.</comment>
