<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interior contradiction—duty to guide versus the orchard’s hunger—drives every micro-choice; the nut’s burn in palm embodies cost. Voice stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final recognition that the blueprint *wants* to be remembered crystallizes a believable, weary acceptance. No safety-hedging; moral ambiguity stays intact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blueprint’s sentient desire becomes undeniable, reframing every prior guide-choice as complicity. Causal lattice holds—each guided traveler tightens the spiral toward this revelation. The nut’s return in the final beat carries visible conceptual cost: freedom may require surrendering the self to the maze. Lens (Causal) is taught early and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment (orchard, cliff, birds) literally rewrites footpaths; the nut functions as micro-setting that constrains route-selection. “Bruised silver fruit” and “iron wings clicked” compress world-rules into sensory hooks. Spatial choreography stays clean across ghost-path overlays. Final image—orchard as living blueprint—recharges every prior detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—keep travelers alive before frost—tightens when birds herd the mapless man inward. Each guided soul forecloses future options, escalating moral cost under causal lens. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through accumulating complicity. Visible price: frost etches rejected paths nightly, a literal tally of failures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated choice: complicity vs compassion inside an unfinishable maze. “Blueprint that remembers” reweights earlier frost-traces into a living archive of guilt. No moralizing line—insight stays embedded in the final nut-burn. Ambiguity lingers: is surrender to the blueprint liberation or deeper curse?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, tidal, salted: “sea grind the cliff below,” “rust freckled their brass feathers.” Syntax mirrors caretaker’s staggered exhaustion—fragments when paths splice. Lyric compression taught early (“orchard clung like a bad decision”) stays legible at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature never slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for maze sprawl, staccato when birds click overhead. Figurative layer is sparse, never clogs causality. No loops, no scaffold; “ghost paths forked and rejoined” does triple duty (image, rule, foreshadow). Opening and final lines echo without mechanical symmetry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical birds as census takers for a sentient topological blueprint. Orchard-as-archive transcends standard curse-topography. Risk taken—lyric mosaic over plotted scene—pays off when blueprint’s desire reconfigures every prior guide-act. Specificity of “nut no bigger than thumbnail” anchors abstraction.</comment>
