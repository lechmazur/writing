<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is textured—his synesthetic spill-over from stage lights into “cobwebs of possible choices” is vivid, and the contradiction between wanting to map others and needing sleep is on-page. Naya’s skepticism is shown through gesture (tilt of mica, sideways smile) rather than label. Micro-choice—Eli reaches with intention, not hands—earns the final shift; cost is felt when he admits “I remember everything, and that is the problem.” Voice convergence under stress is minimal; both registers stay distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Eli reframes the “curse” into a tool while the studio hum accepts the new steady traffic—felt cost is the irrevocable insomnia and ethical gray zone. Causal lens holds: static shock → residual pathways → intentional redirection; no soft reset. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no penalty. One minor ellipsis—how pill + shock = permanent link is implied not parsed—but the rule is accepted retroactively and drives tactics, so waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The light-painting studio is not backdrop; its fiber brushes and geode sliver are tactile levers that constrain choice (only here can they test light/projection). Body-as-setting functions—Eli’s electrified fingertips replace walls for spatial anchor. Fractal reflections from mica reweight the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies track from stage memory to floor-sitting without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Eli aim the overflow or be consumed—signals early and tightens once: the knot in the audience-web must be loosened or his ribs stay tight. Agency is present; intention redirection is on-page and narrows future options (he surrenders rest). Cost is visible (insomnia, ethical blur) but could be sharper—no concrete object lost. Sufficient for length, but not yet 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ethical seeing emerges through image, not lecture: “return the light” reweights prior absorption of audience grief. Subtext in Naya’s hand-hover—trust without touch—carries the skeptic-versus-believer debate. No final moralizing; resonance is in the dulling mica and steady hum. Ambiguity lingers—tool or curse—earned by concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV stays tight third single; no leakage. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—sound is color, memory is cobweb—consistent throughout. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences in calmer beats, clipped fragments when Eli “reaches with intention.” Diction stays within art-school lexicon; no academic register drift. Dialogue sparse but carries indirection (“show me your haunted corridors”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors are controlled—willowglass, traffic hum—each returns to charge closure. High density: one sentence does memory + metaphor + stake (“paths clung like cobwebs…tugging whenever he tried to rest”). A single compressed participle opener is justified by lyric mode. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle: telepathy as stage-light pattern spill-over reframed through design thinking. Geode-mica becomes optical tool而非New Age prop; risk taken and paid off. Synthesis feels inevitable—prior light-show images prefigure the closing “return the light.” Not quite 9 because premise bones remain familiar (drug + glitch), but flesh is idiosyncratic.</comment>
