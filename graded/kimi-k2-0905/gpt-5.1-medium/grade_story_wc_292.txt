<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—idealism versus the dread of repeating exile—are alive in every beat: she volunteers for a station she suspects is still a prison, copies forbidden verse into data, wears the nail that both honors and questions. Interiority is concrete (“copper nail…a talisman and a question pressed to her skin”) and degrades under sweat-dread. Micro-choice to tag Tamar’s stanza as climate data is the hinge that forecloses her own innocence and costs her the official record; the price is felt. No safety-hedging: she perpetuates exile to reverse it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Liora’s digital graft of Tamar’s stanza into the forecast makes the erased ancestor an unerasable layer of future weather—exile reverses itself in the data-cloud. Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore chain from crate → decoded coordinates → realization → deliberate contamination of the dataset. Cost is legible: “Tag what is taken, so the taken can return” reweights the station’s purpose and forecloses her own clean service record. Pattern taught early (coded stanzas) pays off in the final bureaucratic keystroke.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: sweating concrete drinks the bunk-foam, barometers groan like guilty masts, the copper nail warms against her skin—environment and tool constrain every move. Micro-setting (the nail, the data console) literally rewrites the climate record and thus the future. Spatial choreography is clean: crate → journal → director’s table → digital log, all tracked without drift. Final image recharges the same sweating walls now haunted by an ancestor’s forecast that can no longer be deleted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem Tamar by proving the station itself is the ongoing sentence—tightens when coordinates encode the very platform she stands on. One decisive turn: copying the stanza into the official forecast narrows her options to complicity or exile-within-exile; the price is immediate (she can never again claim bureaucratic innocence). Pressure escalates under causal lens: each decoded verse walks the convoy away from mines, tightening the moral cost of erasure. No coincidence; the drone drop is early, the rest is her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: archival erasure and meteorological erasure are the same weather pattern. Subtext lives in gesture—tagging data is a quiet act of civil disobedience more potent than any speech. Final image (“the copper nail…warmed slowly against her heart”) reweights exile itself as a reversible current in the data-ocean. No moralizing; the resonance is the chill recognition that future storms will now navigate by Tamar’s reclaimed name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric scientist meets drowned poet: “pages puffed and rosy like drowned lungs,” “sky a constant bruised lint.” Perceptual signature is salt-archival—every noun carries barometric pressure. Compression taught early (“slant rhymes about currents that walked”) is paid off in the final bureaucratic stanza. No head-hops; distance stays tight inside Liora’s sweat-slick skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with stalled fronts: longer clauses swell, then cut to single verbs (“walked away,” “tagged the entry”). No synonym loops; “sweat” returns only when it changes state (walls→mattress→skin). Information density high: one sentence can crate, crest-recognition, and historical vertigo. Figurative language is patterned (water-death metaphors) and coherent; no mixed vessels. Final line lands with tactile precision—“warmed slowly”—no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-fiction meets archival noir via shipwrecked code-poetry. The reversible-exile concept is literalized as a bureaucratic layer in the forecast—an angle not seen before. Copper nail and drowned stanzas are particular to this drowned world; swap any prop and the logic collapses. Risk in lyric info-dump is embraced and repaid when the data-tag reconfigures meteorological history.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Her idealism is the engine: volunteers for what she suspects is still a prison, chooses to contaminate the dataset, forfeiting bureaucratic innocence—two beats plus closure linkage with visible cost.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>Handled in discovery beat, worn during decryption, warmed in final image; its crest matches the journals and its three-dot sunburst becomes the tag that rewrites forecast—irreplaceable.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Concept shapes every turn: station = rebuilt exile; decoding its coordinates = recognition; tagging data = reversal of sentence—closure is the conceptual flip from prisoner to author of record.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Nervous confidence enables her to confront the director and to risk tagging official data; trembling sweat against the nail shows cost, preventing over-confidence drift.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>The single question (“Who else was sent here…?”) reframes the entire station as penal colony and triggers the director’s slippery “officially,” tightening the moral stakes.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Coded stanzas are the only vector to Tamar’s voice and the coordinate proof; Liora must physically peel and decode them—mechanics drive midpoint revelation and final data entry.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Station’s sweating walls, groaning towers, and data console are active: they drink dread, confess guilt, and host the reversible exile; tagging console inside these walls alters future storm paths.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>Post-shift climate is the reason the platform is rebuilt and why exile persists; stalled-front present weather keeps her inside decoding, giving temporal urgency to forecast deadlines.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Ancestor motive is dramatized: copper nail against skin, refusal to let Tamar stay erased, active choice to graft her stanza into climate data—honor becomes insurgence with cost.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Spongey dread saturates every surface (sweating concrete, mattress drinking fear) and modulates into purposeful urgency once data is tagged—final warmth of nail converts dread into weighted resolve.</question>
