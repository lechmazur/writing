<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The saxophonist’s contradictory hunger for novelty and later horror at the cost of his music are shown through concrete beats—playing the coded tune, fleeing the city, daily attempts to reverse the prophecy. His interiority is character-specific: the way he hears instructions “as shapes carved through negative space,” the bodily memory of the club’s dust in the final chord. The micro-choice to refuse the fatal notes in the grotto is earned by the slow accumulation of dread; the cost is visible in his exile and the eerie nostalgia that replaces triumph. No stock therapy-speak; every emotional label is filtered through sensory metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly via Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy unhooks from the future not by louder playing but by deliberate omission—negative space as silencing tool. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through daily ritual and sensory pattern until the final cadence unravels the tune. Orientation is complete by line 5; transition between city memory and present grotto is legible and signaled by the patched case. Cost is unmistakable: the heavier fog, bruised prisms, and the “eerie nostalgia for a disaster that might now refuse to happen.”</comment>

<comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: its mineral patience, weeping stalactites, and prism atrium actively filter and reshape sound, constraining how the protagonist can play. Dewdrops serve as a living metronome, marking both time and rests. The patched sax case and the uninked lake are tactile, character-filtered objects that charge the final image—notes scratched like “slow handwriting” that must then be unwritten. No static postcarding; every detail is woven through action or sonic consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence a prophecy he once spoke—tightens through daily iteration: each dawn is one more chance to fail. Escalation is textural: the prophecy’s “stubborn eagerness” grows audible under his playing, forcing a final tactic of refusal-through-absence. Cost is visible: the grotto colors bruise, fog thickens, and the future “loosens” with an undeniably eerie nostalgia rather than victory. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; it lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of creation and erasure: music as both prophecy and exorcism. The quiet ending reframes silence as the ultimate artistic act—“a damp exhale swallowed by the stone.” No moralizing; the insight rests in the image of shards realigning when the fatal chord is withheld. Ambiguity is purposeful: the disaster avoided remains hypothetical, the cost is the hollow relief of averting what you yourself invoked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature is consistent—sound is tasted, light is bruised, silence has texture. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for fog-blurred memory, clipped fragments for the moment of refusal. Metaphors are sensory, never editorial: “sound and silence weigh the same” is a physical fact inside this world. No filter-verb stacks; every image is delivered through body or instrument.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers time, sensory input, and metaphor—“the lake was a sheet of uninked paper waiting for his notes to scratch their slow handwriting across it.” No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the sonic conceit without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls like breath through the horn. Only hairline slip: “vested hush” is slightly opaque on first appearance, but the context teaches the phrase immediately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: jazz noir meets ecological prophecy in a mist-walled grotto. The idea that a melody can kill and must then be un-played is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—translators inventing an eighth language, station-stickered case, dewdrop rests—anchors the concept. Risk of abstraction is taken and paid off: negative space as narrative method becomes literal technique for averting doom.</comment>
