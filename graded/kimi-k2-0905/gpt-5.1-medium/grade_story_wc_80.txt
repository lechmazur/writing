<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—certifying safety while secretly memorializing loss—are embodied in every micro-choice; the antique inkwell anchors generational memory and her stoic sensitivity costs her solitude. Her final renunciation (sealing the last note, turning back toward neon forgetting) is earned and visibly priced. No clichéd interiority; every beat is filtered through her surveyor’s eye and grief. Interior contradiction peaks as she “tucks someone into sleep” with grout—tender violence that forecloses her own witness.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion sinks while her hidden archive “breathes,” reweighting the city’s amnesia with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: each note placed = one concrete because/therefore that narrows her future complicity. Time-anchor (drawbridge rising) appears in line 1; space and POV remain lucid. No lens ambiguity—accumulative pattern of sealed absences tightens to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Submerged pavilion is not backdrop but antagonist: barnacled balustrades force her kneeling, cracked mosaics mirror her cracked interior, tide-level sets the ticking clock. Brass inkwell’s crescent shine is micro-setting that charges the final pocket-weight. Sensory hierarchy obeys her surveyor gaze—dimensions, load tolerances, salt-light refracted through glass ribs. Spatial choreography tracks skiff→steps→column hollow without drift; weather (tide pressing higher) alters egress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. obliteration—signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: last note sealed just as tide blocks return, foreclosing retrieval. Cost is visible: she loses physical evidence yet gains invisible archive. Escalation is accumulative: each grout swallow deepens the irreversibility; no external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox—engineering repair as burial ritual—never stated but re-enacted. Final image (“absence, properly mapped, can burn”) is Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior sealed crack. Subtext in gesture: folding paper before grout is origami obituary. No moralizing; reader left to feel archive’s silent lungs under neon city.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains surveyor’s calibrated perceptual signature—measurements, blueprint strips, salt light. Syntax mirrors tide: long clauses wash in, then fragment at grout release. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly Mara-bound. Register never drifts into academic loft; “hushed blaze” is her coinage, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer job title, secret calling, and grandfather relic. Metaphors are coherent—pavilion as drowned lantern, grout as sleep—without mixed logic. Rhythm varies: staccato “She writes…” anaphora accelerates urgency, then slows into final lucid dark. One paraphrase loop (“absence layered within absence”) is purposeful echo, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips urban fantasy trope—instead of rising sea as dystopian spectacle, it becomes quiet archive of forgotten names. Fresh synthesis: inspection reports turned confessional; engineering grout as headstone. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final “hushed blaze” reconfiguration. Could not swap inkwell or pavilion without collapsing metaphoric scaffold.</comment>
