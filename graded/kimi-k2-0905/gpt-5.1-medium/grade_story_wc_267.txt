<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bellhop’s shift from obedient silence to spoken rebellion is embodied and costly; the phantom-labor frame lets us feel nerves re-knit while he re-lives the fall. Contradictory impulses—loyalty to guests vs. need to speak—crackle in the staircase moment where he touches the bruise and remembers dying. The final micro-choice, “Enough,” is small, spoken aloud, and paid for with literal re-shattering: causality and cost meet the 9+ gate. Minor slip: “seraphically mundane” is gestured, not fully dramatized in a second beat, capping the top sliver.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the fortress cracks, snow enters as language, and safety is re-defined as the courage to leave. The causal chain (bolt → memory → speech → collapse) tightens once under accumulative design; each flake returns a stolen syllable, making the cost audible. Orientation is taught early via “no doors, only a revolving lobby of echoes,” so no penalty. One hairline slip: the avalanche injury is summoned late as off-stage premise, but it is anchored in the lobby-phantom split and paid back in the final shatter, so the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fortress is simultaneously architecture, body, and suppressive rule-set: discolored stone tracks every failed escape, chandelier registers the first spoken word. Micro-setting—the staircase bruise—literally darkens under the protagonist’s palm and forces the memory that re-prices silence. Snow’s return is tactically deployed, not postcard pretty; each flake is a lost syllable regained, charging the final image. Gate met: environment plus recurring bolt constrain the climax choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence as survival vs. voice as destruction—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the first whispered sentence makes the chandelier chime. The bolt/hand/bruise sequence is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses the safe option; no reversal is needed under the accumulative lens. Price is audible: fortress cracks, bones re-break, snow rushes in. One minor drag: avalanche as off-stage catalyst slightly blurs cost visibility, keeping it just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bolt, the bruise, the snow: safety purchased by silencing victims is worse than the storm. No moralizing—final image of snow as chorus re-weights the premise without sermon. The unpardonable silence is re-defined as self-inflicted only at the moment the protagonist feels the wall where he died; insight is earned, not declared. Ambiguity lingers: we sense many will die when storms enter, yet the ethical ledger is now visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person texture is unmistakable: “my nerves still sang clean notes of fear and faith” marries physiology to acoustics. Compression—“seraphically mundane smile of someone who had made tea during artillery fire”—teaches the reader the paradox pattern early and repays it at the screamed “Enough.” No head-hopping; the woman’s interior is only inferred, maintaining distance. Rhythm surges with the final snow torrent, syntax loosening from controlled clauses to clause-spilling rush that mirrors the fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet breathe: “piano bench bolt rolling across the marble floor” fuses sound, motion, and prophecy in one stroke. Metaphors (lightning learning to climb) extend the world’s physics without contradiction. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or pressure. A single register spike—“seraphically mundane”—is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, not purple, so no penalty; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The invisible, sound-eating fortress that rewrites dissenters into furniture is a fresh angle on the “silent hotel” trope. Bolt-as-missing-key and staircase-as-bruise convert familiar gothic props into memory triggers that charge the ethical reversal. Proximity check: no echo of famous scenes; the snow-as-language payoff feels inevitable only after it lands. Risk is present but slightly cushioned by recognizable ice-avant-garde aesthetics, holding it shy of the top sliver.</comment>
