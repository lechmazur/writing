<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The titan’s caretaker-versus-king tension stays mostly observational; his sole micro-choice is deciding to seed the messages, a decision told rather than dramatized with bodily cost. Interiority is vivid (“seasickness of the soul”) yet never cracks into contradictory impulse under pressure. Because the climax is the scholar’s recognition rather than his own stance shift, the arc plateaus at competent rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the scholar’s “graceful collapse of a thought” is a Charged Poise that reweights the genealogical lie with conceptual cost. Causality holds—each library seed causes the next doubt—though the titan’s ultimate fate remains suspended. The accumulative design teaches its pattern early and pays off in a single resonant image, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<comment>The fossilized-sky ribs, ink-pellet moons, and mis-shelved dynasties create a micro-setting that directly enables the titan’s stratagem; without the library’s cracked oculus and worm-eaten pages the messages cannot travel. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—he notices stone bowing “the faintest fraction,” a tactile confirmation of hidden mass. Detail is selective, never touristic, and the final star-crawl across the oculus recharges the initial celestial pause.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing the enthronement of the wrong man—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each encoded marginal note. The single meaningful deepening arrives when the scholar’s recognition crystallizes the threat, narrowing options from abstract worry to irrevocable knowledge. Cost is conceptual but legible: the titan sacrifices his anonymity and risks erasure if the palace re-awakens. Agency is indirect yet causal under Accumulative lens—each ink mark is an irreversible increment toward truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between written lineage and lived legitimacy; no character ever names the theme aloud. The rune of drift and split-crown illumination reappear with shifted weight, embodying the idea that names can be carried away from the bodies that earned them. The final image of the scholar’s “thought realizing it has stood on air” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the titan’s own fate remains unsettled, underscoring that history is a library still being written.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, ancient, and compressively lyrical: “stars hung like thoughts someone had forgotten to finish.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during star-crawl, then shortens to hammer the scholar’s collapse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—the titan’s scale distortion colors every object. Experimental elision (“measured not by hours but by the slow crawling of a single star”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only “stacked precariously” beside “waiting for one more subtle mark” faintly repeats the concept of delicate balance. Figurative language stays coherent—ink pellets as moons, crown as seed-pod—without mixed-metaphor bleed. Information density is high: one sentence often layers celestial mechanics, archival decay, and political stakes. Rhythm modulates from incantatory listing to staccato recognition, propelling the final collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of titanic scale with librarian delicacy feels fresh; “diminutive titan” is instantly specific rather than checklist-quirky. Time-stalled constellations as a messaging channel reweights the familiar “lost archive” trope. Risky accumulative structure is justified because the closure image retroactively validates every marginal doodle. The concept commits fully—no safety exit via waking from dream or spell undone.</comment>
