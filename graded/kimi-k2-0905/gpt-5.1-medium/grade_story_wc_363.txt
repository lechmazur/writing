<comment>Nari’s interiority is precise and embodied—“she pressed the bead to her lips and whispered the unfinished messages”—and her contradictory impulse to speak yet distrust words drives every beat. The final renunciation—feeding her decade of woven youth into the puzzle—pays off the motif of words dissolving and re-inscribes her brother-fixation with visible cost. No stock phrasing; even “wistful” is earned through action. Micro-choices (trading wool, pressing bead, unweaving) reveal a hierarchy of values that forecloses the loom-path forever.</comment>

<comment>The mosaic two-shard structure (loom orchard → puzzle window) is taught by 25 % and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the finished puzzle exhales warm breath that turns distant footsteps, reweighting silence into answer. Causal linkage holds—because she unweaves the tapestry, the blizzard image breathes back—with persistent constraint (bare loom) visible in the final line. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity at closure. Cost is legible: “the orchard felt abruptly older” after the sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>The orchard-as-lover detail—“crooked apple trees rose among bamboo stalks like old men lost at a festival”—constrains her solitude and later the bare-loom image. Bamboo swallowing paths explains why no search parties return, thus shaping her puzzle gamble. Micro-setting object (amber bead) is handled thrice and charges the final image when it becomes the “small sun setting in cardboard sky.” Weather and graft history evolve causally with plot; no static postcard.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reach Haru—tightens once: unweaving the tapestry forecloses her decade-long ritual and narrows options to the puzzle window. Visible price paid on-page: the loom stands “bare and skeletal,” orchard “abruptly older.” Escalation is accumulative-textural: density of silence increases until the puzzle exhalation breaks pattern. No coincidence; the blizzard image is earned by thread-feeding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-fabric emerges from concrete events—threads catching “echoes of things not yet happened”—never abstract assertion. Final image reweights silence from lack to portal without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: hanging bead on cardboard corner = offering her heart to absence. The unsent messages remain unsent, yet silence becomes answer; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a spindle-tight rhythm—“she wove because she could not bear how quickly words dissolved”—with perceptual signature attuned to hush and warp. No head-hopping; POV stays interior to Nari. Syntax mirrors loom motion: long sentences unwind, then snap short at sacrifice. Register never drifts above mountain-village lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “frost silvered the fallen apples; the puzzle grew from scattered teeth into a jagged window” advances time, sets, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; each image fresh. Metaphors physically coherent—threads feed cardboard gaps, no mixed vehicles. Final third clean: no artifact touches closure beat. Momentum breathes but never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw puzzle as sideways loom that warps space rather than cloth, turning cardboard edges into warp threads—idea feels inevitable after established. Risk of unweaving ten-year tapestry paid off by emergent breath-through-window. Silence-as-yarn concept reconfigures familiar grief tale into speculative lyric. Specificity: grafted apple-bamboo orchard forgotten by time is nowhere but here.</comment>
