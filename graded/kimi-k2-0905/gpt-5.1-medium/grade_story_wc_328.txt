<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator-researcher’s undercover motive is vivid and embodied (pulse in soil, phone hiss); interior contradiction—wanting taxonomy yet awed—drives every beat. Final acceptance that mapping fails feels earned because the earlier grid reflex is repeatedly thwarted by tactile wonder. Cost is visible: professional horror sharpened into complicit silence. Flaw: “Maybe work now…” drifts toward diagnostic label; keeps this just outside 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-phone-garden triad reweights the premise—lost people become “what the mountain cannot carry alone.” Causal chain (arrow → doorway → phone → confession-seeds) is tight; each step narrows the investigator’s options. Accumulated texture escalates to irreversible stance shift. Cost is unmistakable in the final line: bitter joke accepted with soil still trembling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underground garden, inverted trees, and bone bowls are not backdrop—they force the narrator’s methodological surrender. Micro-setting rule met: the cordless phone and arrowhead physically constrain passage and perception. Sensory triage (metallic air after archway) mirrors epistemic rupture. Spatial choreography spotless; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand what is taking them”—tightens when each confession seed narrows the investigator’s epistemic tools to zero. Single decisive intensification: phone pressed into hands turns reconnaissance into complicity; no off-stage rescue. Price is legible: the researcher forfeits taxonomy for listening. Slight reserve: escalation is one beat, not a chain; still sufficient for sub-1 k word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: disappearance as redistribution into ungovernable chorus. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s braid “pendulum that had made peace with time” silently argues for acceptance. Final image (“larger, stranger chorus”) reweights every prior detail without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “patient hornets,” “bruise in reality,” “therapy-speak of frostbitten hope.” Syntax glides from catalogic researcher cadence to lyrical surrender, mirroring epistemic collapse. No head-hop; distance control immaculate. Dialogue-free design is authorial choice, not omission—voice sustains alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or metaphor muddle; each figurative vehicle is paid off (hornets → lamps, bruise → reality tear). Information density high—one sentence often handles atmosphere, character, and causality. Rhythm accelerates into the static burst, then exhales with soil heartbeat. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, unadorned payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid-horror meets eco-elegy via botanical afterlife. Cordless phone as confessional seeding device is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person static voices pay off by reconfiguring grief into bioluminescence. Concept commits fully—no retreat to conventional monster reveal.</comment>
