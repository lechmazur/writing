<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ilan’s interior contradiction—healing others while nursing his own unhealed wound—surfaces through micro-choices (needle placement, whispered refusal to the voice) and culminates in the Earned Stasis of accepting the name’s cost. Embodied grief is vivid, but the brother-loss backstory is relayed in a 42-word block that does not tilt the present stance; still, the moment-to-moment tremor in his wrists and the whispered bargain supply enough corporeal cost to satisfy the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Holds Accumulative/Textural lens throughout: each unraveled knot thickens the silence rather than forwarding plot causality, and closure lands as Charged Poise—the sanctuary air now “grounded,” a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by line 7 (“prism sanctuary under starlight”), well before 120 words, satisfying the single-scene window; no causality breaks, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The prism sanctuary, starlight, salt-thick air, and stiff net are filtered through Ilan’s restorer-eye—light “bent into patient planes,” net “ghostly with moonlit dust.” These micro-details constrain his ritual movements and charge the final image when the grounded stillness settles into the same stone. Spatial choreography stays clean as he circles the net; environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring the dead captain’s name to quiet restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens as each knot releases lived nights at sea. The final knot forces a trade-off: Ilan must vow to carry then release the secret, a visible cost that forecloses his habitual anonymity. Escalation is textural—silence accumulating weight—yet agency remains his; coincidence never intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of masks, nets, and names: identity is something re-woven, never possessed. Subtext lives in gesture—threading the star-colored needle, inhaling salt—never in thesis statements. The ending’s grounded stillness reweights prior “lucid unrest” into earned quiet, offering a non-literal answer: restoration is not ownership but temporary carrying. No moralizing, no symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Ilan’s perceptual signature: light “quivered with lucid unrest,” knots “thrum as if ready to exhume.” Syntax lengthens and relaxes under the hush, then shortens at the final tug. No head-hopping; diction stays within coastal-ritual register. Compression (“interlaced hush”) is taught by line 2 and paid off in the closing stillness. Distinctive texture without mosaic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm swells and ebbs with the knotwork; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense (“light bent into patient planes,” “shadows… like curious birds”) yet each image serves atmosphere or stakes, never purple. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, mood, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Closure line is clean, luminous, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing mask-mending with net-unraveling as necromantic confession feels fresh and inevitable: the restorer who grounds living faces must also ground dead names. The fisherman’s net as palimpsest of nights, curses, and cards is concrete world-building, not allegory. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—pays off in the charged poise ending. Could edge higher if coastal folklore were even more specific, but transformation is already non-generic.</comment>
