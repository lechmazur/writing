<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The illustrator’s interior contradiction—draw to capture vs. refuse to cage—drives every beat; the final renunciation (“brought back drawings, not chains”) is embodied, costly, and fully earned. Micro-choices under pendant-heat (sketching absence, knotting time) reveal a values hierarchy that scales to the cosmic premise. The keeper’s brief presence supplies secondary pressure without clutter. Voice stays crisp, never drifts into diagnostic self-talk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: pendant-hum → canal keeper yields passage → pendant-knot → time-sculpt → choice to release echoes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty-hand line reweights the whole quest, foreclosing profit or control with undeniable social cost (client unpaid, keeper’s warning fulfilled). One transition (gondola → solo exit) is cleanly anchored. No set-up amnesia; object states track.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop canal tiles, leaning-tower teeth, pendant wire loop, and giant-breath tides all constrain navigation and tempo; the canal surface literally dictates when the protagonist can sketch or breathe. Micro-setting (pendant, tiles, water droplets) doubles as tool and clock. Sensory economy favors auditory/tactile over visual catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vs. liberate the first echo—tightens when the protagonist discovers that to draw is to cage; the pendant’s overheating escalates the cost of continuing. Agency culminates in the conscious release of grip, scattering futures. One meaningful deepening: silence peeled like paint reveals unborn voices tugging memories. Cost is visible: forfeited commission, unanswered client, keeper’s feared prophecy honored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes around the ethics of representation—art as seizure vs. reverence—emerging through the act of sketching absence rather than presence. No overt thesis; final line offers resonant non-literal answer. Motif of “interrupted cadence” reweights from nervous tic to moral stance. Ambiguity lingers: did the city gain or lose its echo-teacher? Complexity preserved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a scientific illustrator’s perceptual signature: taxonomic noticing, line-quality metaphors, metric calm under surreal stress. Rhythm modulates with pendant pulses—long sentences during stretched time, staccato beats at climax. No head-hop; free indirect stays clean. Diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon; canal keeper’s idiom distinctively weather-map economical. Non-standard grammar absent; no dialogue contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence runs. Information density high: single sentences layer sensory data, emotional valence, and world rule. Figurative language controlled; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Minor filter-verb cluster (“I realized,” “I understood”) in climactic beat costs −0.2. No paraphrase loops, no typographic errors. Final line snaps shut by image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy scaffolding (giant sleep-clock, rooftop canals, echo-breeding) feels freshly synthesized through illustrator’s observational lens, not genre checklist. Premise of art-as-trap versus art-as-liberation reframes familiar quest. Pendant’s time-sculpt mechanic is specific, irreversible, and morally charged. Risky surrealism stays coherent under causal lens without late rule patches.</comment>
