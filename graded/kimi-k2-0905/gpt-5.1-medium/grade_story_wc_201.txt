<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—pain is read “through flinches and heart stutters,” not labels—but the climactic decision to enter the frame is more symbolic inevitability than fresh contradiction; the spine-brace micro-choice helps yet the final surrender feels pre-scripted by the concept rather than a new fracture in self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap descends and pain “begins to factor,” a legible before/after with cost. Causal logic holds—each remembered injury motivates the walk toward the frame—though the forest-as-interface rule is taught late; the orientation waiver applies because disorientation pays off in the reconfigured meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest and pewter strap function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the strap’s coil “like a discarded question mark” physically anchors the decision to submit. Sensory selection stays urgent—UV light is “a bruise… invisible to ordinary eyes”—and the frame’s cables into soil track spatially. Environment charges the final image: pain factoring into light equations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mercy’s measurement—arrives early; pressure tightens when the voice demands the frame and the straps “wait like propositions.” Agency is the protagonist’s step into the frame, paying with surrendered body-data; cost is felt in the final flare of UV. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: torture rebranded as “enhanced,” mercy reduced to dataset. The forest’s light graphs literalize the moral calculus without sermon. Final image reweights prior material—pain becomes integer—achieving resonance without stated moral. Avoids tidy binaries; survivor complicity in data generation complicates victim/perpetrator lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct: syntax elongates under stress (“systematic disassembly of the self”) then compresses at decision (“I stepped”). Perceptual signature is consistent—UV light as “bruise,” proprioceptive map as diary. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; unreliability hinted (“memory had never obeyed instructions”) pays off in data consent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“trees that glowed like stained glass wounds”) and justified by interface premise; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates—long hypotactic musings collapse into short declaratives at entry to frame. One paraphrase loop: “displaced yet rooted” repeated; minor −0.2. Filter verbs minimal; “I felt” clusters acceptably under anesthesia haze.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses torture-survivor memoir with quantum-ethics apparatus; forest-as-interface is fresh. Specific detail—“angles of light intersecting on my skin”—prevents abstract drift. Risk in second-person address from forest is earned because it literalizes invasive interior routes carved by interrogators. Transformation test fails if survivor/data-donor nexus removed; thus not generic.</comment>
