<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apprentice’s interior contradiction—yearning to belong yet fearing the ghost’s claim—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (tasting the bead, pressing it to lips). The final vow feels earned because earlier tactile memories root it; still, the ghost’s motives remain slightly opaque, muting the highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bead-offer → vision → vow tightens options; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—his promise crystallizes enduring servitude with felt cost (“branches bowing in solemn joy”). Orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse, metallic fruit, and smoking veil create immediate, sensory specificity; the bead later constrains choice by warming and weeping steam. Endless night and winter-cracked fields evolve from backdrop to pressure source, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Single dominant stake—free the ghost or remain complicit—tightens once when he accepts the bead; cost is legible (lifelong night-watch). Agency could be sharper: the vow feels inevitable rather than a hard fork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</degree><comment>Theme of cyclical debt and vegetal resurrection emerges through image-pattern (roots, smoke, graft) rather than statement. Final vow offers Charged Poise that reweights orchard as eternal covenant, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric cadence—“hummed like a sleeping heart,” “lovingly venomous”—mirrors apprentice’s mesmeric dread; compression taught early and paid off in final line. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: metaphor clusters serve mesmeric pattern without muddle; rhythm breathes with emotional crests. Minor paraphrase echo (“winter-cracked fields” twice) but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>9.3</question><comment>Alchemical orchard as purgatorial greenhouse feels fresh; trope of ghost-bride transformed into vegetal reincarnation engine. Risky lyric accumulation heightens mythic coherence rather than gimmick.</comment>
