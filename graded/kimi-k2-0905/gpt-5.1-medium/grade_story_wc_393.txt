<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hesitation mirrored in the rain-window, his silence in the cell—but the moral calculus that should complicate his final stance is stated more than dramatized; the bent cog and Mara’s file-work stand in for his own micro-choice, so the cost feels borrowed from the object rather than paid by the chaplain himself. The “aptly deliberate” trait is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the contradiction between pastoral duty and personal doubt pulses throughout, and the renunciation of judgment is credibly earned by the scene’s accumulated guilt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: Jonah hands over the heart → Elias flees to Mara → Mara’s repair reframes the parole question. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elias must stand beside the imperfect ticking, not declare merit. Cost is legible in the final line—“what you are willing to stand beside”—but the off-stage parole board keeps the consequence slightly abstract; a hairline slip from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The shop’s layered ticking and brass gleam are handled, not catalogued; every gear constrains attention and filters Elias’s guilt. Rain turns the window into a “wavering mirror”—a concrete perceptual cue that refracts his self-interrogation. The micro-setting of the clockwork heart itself serves as the final environmental pivot, its altered beat dictating the chaplain’s next move. One notch below 9+ only because the exterior street remains a backdrop rather than a tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias face the parole board after withholding absolution—tightens once: the repaired heart converts abstract forgiveness into a concrete auditory test. The bent cog supplies visible price, but the board’s decision is still prospective; pressure peaks inside the shop rather than in front of the inmates, so escalation is micro not macro. Sufficient for the length, yet the cost is vicarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: gears = remorse, light = judgment. No character articulates a moral; the final instruction to “tell the board what you hear” reweights silence as solidarity, not verdict. The ambiguity is purposeful and haunting—Elias’s authority is shrunk to witness, not judge—delivering resonant reconfiguration without preachiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person flexes close psychic distance, filtering every detail through Elias’s clerical eye: “gears whispering beneath glass,” “color of late autumn leaves.” Syntax stays calm, priest-like, until the single surge of self-indictment—“my silence answered him anyway”—a controlled release that keeps voice intact. No head-hop; Mara’s dialogue carries subtext rather than exposition. A hairline slip into poetic register (“vibrant hush”) is earned by early pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; information is double-loaded—“penitentiary chaplain badge still clipped to his belt, though he was off duty” advances both status and guilt. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb chains. Metaphors stay consistent to the clockwork lexicon; “confession snagging on a word” is apt and fresh. Minor near-repeat of “aptly deliberate” twice, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing spiritual doubt with horological repair feels inevitable yet non-generic; the shop as confessional is a fresh spatial move. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, no twist—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could tip higher with a sharper external consequence, yet the internal reconfiguration is sufficiently singular.</comment>
