<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is richly concrete and character-specific; the crisis-actor past is embodied in the sensory memory of “fingers brushing shoulders,” not therapy-speak. Micro-choices—walking the apology into stone, refusing to shatter the boy’s ignorance—show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only drag is that the custodian relationship, though tonally potent, remains off-stage; his “benevolent ruthlessness” is reported, not dramatized, so the final stasis feels slightly under-catalyzed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the gallery will keep whispering stories the narrator has walked into it, a conceptual repricing that makes the city’s leaderless state and the narrator’s pawn-renunciation irreversible. Causality is accumulative/image-driven rather than event-linear; each circuit of foot-walked text tightens the stake of what can be archived before power returns. The cost is legible in the final line: the building’s future silence will be filled only with routes of words his feet can no longer add. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and pay off in the dome’s final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic arcs literally let strangers divorce without eye contact and let the narrator write apologies into stone. The chessboard’s pawn-absence is handled twice—first as morgue-drawer, finally as phantom knight-moves—charging the closing question of refused promotion. Micro-setting (the curved floor) constrains every step and dictates how text can be archived; the dome’s draft is the final image that reweights the city’s vacancy. Environment, tool, and recurring object all meet the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Pressure escalates by density and pattern-break: each nightly circuit deepens the archive until the stakes shift from “record” to “preserve after power returns.” The protagonist’s agency is the walking itself; the cost is the irreversible foot-worn text that will outlast access. The custodian’s tea-offer after ruthless play marks a micro-turn that tightens the moral trade-off between documentation and complicity. One tightening is enough under Accumulative lens; price is visible in the final locked-door silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: leaderless systems force individuals to become both pawn and board, archive and archive-maker. The chessboard’s missing pawns and the walking-code reprise at the end, reweighting “small gestures” as the only sovereign currency left. Subtext lives in silence—knocks, coughs, unsigned divorces—rendering the unheard political. The closing image of a building that will keep whispering without its archivist offers a resonant, non-moral answer to what a pawn becomes when it refuses promotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: acoustics as luminous absence, grief as spatial circumference. Syntax flexes with pressure—long sentences for circling, fragmented breath-spaces for the boy’s recital. No head-hopping; even the custodian’s interior is accessed only through the narrator’s speculation, preserving distance. Register stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon; “nomadic penumbra” reads as poetic inference, not authorial flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate and read-aloud viable; sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual cadence that mirrors walking circuits. Figurative language is selectively layered—no stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats—so “draft that slipped like a nomadic penumbra” remains singular and clarifying. One minor scaffold: “a kind of luminous absence that hung between strangers” could lose “a kind of,” but the slack is localized and does not touch the closure beat. Information density is high; each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or stake.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor memoir + acoustic architecture + pawnless chess is non-obvious and irreplicable; removing any node collapses the story. The notion of “walking text into stone” as insurgent historiography is a fresh inflection that could not be transposed to another setting. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens rather than obscures meaning. Specificity of detail (glycerin smoke, three-beat knuckle consent) anchors the concept in lived stakes.</comment>
