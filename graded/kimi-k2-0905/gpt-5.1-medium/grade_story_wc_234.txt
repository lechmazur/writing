<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lio’s watcher-inventor blend is sharp; the overheard gin-scene flashback crystallizes motive and flaw. Interiority stays concrete—“golden and sullen” sun mirrors self-doubt without diagnostic speak. Final “solving for us” decision grows cleanly from both craft obsession and friendship debt, cost felt in the act of inscription. Micro-choice hierarchy clear; could use one more embodied tick under extreme pressure to hit 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shell will carry the nexus heat outward, re-weighting “returning differently” with social cost (exile, guild censure) legible in the donated ampoule light. Causal lens holds: because the friends are leaving, therefore Lio must transpose place into object, narrowing his future. Orientation anchors by line 4; no debt. One transition (memory shard) taught early and repaid at end. Cost is felt, not merely declared—pocket sun literally handed over.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective heat imagery—“discarded heat gathers like migrating birds”—filters through Lio’s thermal vocation, constrains later choice to trap that heat in shell. Slag basin, rusted rails, and flicker-lit notes all double as emotional thermometer; setting guides access to guild vs exile paths. Final shell mirror catches pocket-sun light, charging last image with re-weighted meaning—meets 9+ gate. Micro-setting (ampoule glass) behaves as habitat, literal constraint on star’s flare.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve friendship place against exile—signaled by “bring this place with us.” Escalation: guild summons to farm-rings tightens space; shell inscription becomes last chance to bottle “density of presence.” Protagonist agency drives turn: he commits ampoule energy to shell, foreclosing own guild tenure. Cost (loss of safe patent future) visible in “answering both” sacrifice; could be sharper if price echoed in body reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme: transmuting human stubbornness into portable energy emerges through action, not thesis—Lio literalizes friendship density into shell spiral. Subtext of exile, class tension, and artistic contempt for “scientifically romantic” label woven into object choice. Ending image refuses moral; resonance lies in light folded along fossil decision-path. No tidy epiphany—just re-priced loyalties—gives lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice owns perceptual signature: heat as fauna, equations as “scribbles into metaphors,” gin fizz anthropomorphized. Syntax spirals like columella, mirroring obsession; rhythm accelerates at shell reveal then softens for final inscription. No head-hop; register stays within alchemist-poet lexicon. Dialogue sparse but distinct—“You working, Lio, or worshipping?” slides on heat shimmer, reveals status dynamics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence slips time, vocation, and metaphor—“ember nexus at twilight, titles melt.” Metaphors stay thermally coherent; no mixed vehicle accidents. Occasional lyrical stack (“iron halos that catch the last light in trembling filaments”) but pattern taught early, paid off in shell halo. Minor scaffold: “like” simile reliance; does not impede closure. Pronouns clean, tense stable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hard-SF micro-reactor tech with alchemy poetics feels fresh; “pocket-sun alchemist” revalues both guild rigor and romantic trespass. Overheard gin scene as origin beat is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds causal drive without gimmick. Specificity—slag basin, vapor gin, tidal-lab shell—anchors novelty; remove any piece and arc collapses.</comment>
