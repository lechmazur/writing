<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s fear/guilt is palpable in body and voice; Zev’s jagged charisma stays consistent. The moment she laughs through tears feels earned because the refracting questions have forced contradictions into the open. Interiority never resorts to therapy labels; instead, the canyon’s artifacts (bone stools, charcoal smears) externalize states. The final “knowledge of herself” is credibly priced by the night-long abrasion of her confession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each poetic refraction changes Maren’s options until the only path left is the spire with her multiplied truths. Closure is a Charged Poise—she descents carrying “prismatic, aching knowledge,” a conceptual cost that reweights forgiveness itself. The spire’s earlier stakes (strip-versus-whole) cleanly foreclose in a single image. Minor deduct for slight over-exposition in Zev’s warning speech; otherwise causality is airtight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment is protagonist: bone spires dictate acoustics, femur chamber supplies furniture, mist occludes sight and moral certainty. Every object—knuckle chimes, polished vertebra table—constrains how bodies move and speak. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s narrowing attention (smell of river, insect song) rather than tourist catalog. Final mist-bands refract her multiple selves, charging the closure image as required for 9+ gate—only just missing the extra half-point because spatial anchors arrive ~140 words, fractionally late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she earn whole-forgiveness or be flayed by partial truth—escalates with each refracting question, tightening like bone-chimes in wind. No reversals needed; pressure accrues texturally, knowledge replacing bodily safety. The final cost is knowledge itself: she forfeits the comfort of a single verdict. Slight deduction because agency is mostly cognitive; physical risk is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness becomes impossible without internal multiplicity. Subtext lives in gesture—Zev’s grin that “fails to reach his haunted eyes” implies art as futile resistance. No moralizing lines; the canyon’s echo physics enacts the idea. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: many shimmering selves walk beneath, each equally real—fulfilling the 9+ test by a hair’s breadth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is biased toward sound and texture (“cold attention,” “rattling joke”). Diction stays within her vernacular; when Zev speaks sharper, syntax lengthens. Rhythm accelerates during interrogative bursts, mimicking cognitive refraction. Near-perfect control; only tiny lapse of filter verb stack in “she imagined each pale shimmer was…” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical, clauses sliding like bone joints. Metaphors are lean and precise—“forged hush,” “cracked throat”—never crowding. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stakes or image. Minor mixed metaphor “price paid in ignorance” forgiven because it is voiced by Zev and matches his elliptical idiom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Bone-canyon confessional is bold world-building; transforms familiar guilt/ritual trope into materialized poetics. Impromptu poetry as interrogation device feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Specific details (chimes of knuckles, vertebra table) anchor abstraction in tactile novelty. Risk of preciousness fully embraced and paid off by closure, meriting high-band bonus.</comment>
