<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s quiet ache to “learn the rhythm of belonging” is embodied in micro-choices—tracing patterns with the burnt feather, asking Mira to dim the lights—so the renunciation of fixed charts feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: the feather smells of leaving, the chest knot loosens when shrimp write “wild script” on the glass. The only slack is the village-fire backstory, which tilts toward label-speak (“smelled of leaving”) rather than fresh sensory cost; still, the final shared exhale visibly pays the price of giving up astrological certainty for tidal breathing with Mira.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome adopts “a breathing rhythm” that reweights belonging from chart to listening, with the felt cost of surrendering surface certainty (the feather’s uselessness). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light failure adds density until the bioluminescent shrimp pattern-break reconfigures attention. Causality is coherent—because lights fail, narrator experiments; therefore volunteers drift, fish veer, and new lighting tides are installed. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and never waver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drowned city is not backdrop but pressure source: algae-furred statues and “reefs made from forgotten errands” guide the narrator’s decision to swap chart-trust for tide-listening. Micro-setting inside the dome—condensation-fogged glass, rebreather collar blur—constrains the feather-tracing action that drives the climax. Spatial choreography is immaculate: volunteers orbit kiosks, fish write silver cursive, shoulders almost touch. Environment charges the final image when the dome “became a chamber of shadowseam wonder,” meeting the 9+ gate for constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging via attention control—tightens once: the narrator’s experimental dimming forecloses reliance on charts and risks volunteer safety, visible when they drift toward half-light. Cost is legible: the burnt feather’s impotence and the surrender of “fixed beacon” identity. Escalation is accumulative; each flicker adds pattern weight until shrimp ascend to reweight the stake. No reversal, but the deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-attuned-breathing emerges through image, not thesis: feather-smoke knot loosens during “shared exhale,” echoing dome’s new “breathing rhythm.” Subtext in Mira’s “mirrored nod” and the narrator’s shoulder-almost-touch shows belonging negotiated in silence. Final image reweights prior motifs—charts, lights, feather—without moralizing. Only hairline slip is “shadowseam wonder,” a touch slogan-like, but context reclaims it as sensory, not abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “city that slept underwater,” “reefs made from forgotten errands,” “quick silver cursive.” Rhythm modulates from long floodlit clauses to the staccato “tiny bioluminescent shrimp rose… winking on and off.” No head-hop; first-person stays strictly inside the astrologer’s biased noticing. Filter verbs serve voice (“I felt something loosen”) rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job-double duty—e.g., “banks of lights along the dome flickered like tired stars” advances setting, stakes, and simile. Metaphors stay coherent within underwater optics (glass, stars, tide). One mixed vehicle—“knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned”—barely grazes closure. Opening line anchors voice and final line resolves by image (“gentle pulses, teaching me how to belong by listening”) without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater light-astrology plus bioluminescent shrimp as living constellation rewrites both horoscope and habitat tropes. Burnt-feather-into-tracing-tool transforms trauma into instrument of new attention. Risk of quiet lyric ending pays off because the breathing dome image is unforeseeable yet inevitable after tidal patterning. No derivative premise penalty; underwater cities are familiar, but “attention architecture” angle is non-obvious.</comment>
