<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tinkerer’s interiority is lightly sketched—his “suspicion” about alignment is the only explicit contradiction—but his embodied humming, listening, and final micro-choice (pouring the bowl) earn a credible renunciation of solitary craft for communal rhythm. No secondary character exerts individuated pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw-risk balance is safe: he never errs or pays a wound, so the arc is more gentle activation than crucible. Still, the single POV stays coherent, and the endurance of shared rhythm carries a soft cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared breath and blossoms reconfigure the village’s future without forcing cruelty, and the copper bowl’s spilled memories make the conceptual cost legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of song, root, blossom—cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clean: gate, arbor, dawn anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity. One soft spot: the elders’ undefined “alignment” is a deliberate mystery that pays off in communal breath rather than plot cheat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting: its bark grain, moss fur, and silver fog constrain the tinkerer’s posture and inform his humming pitch. Vine tendril curls twice—first as sensor, finally as witness—charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, fitting the hush. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore fertility without cruelty—is signaled early; tightening occurs when the tinkerer realizes alignment equals synchronized breath, foreclosing the option of solitary heroics. Cost is soft but legible: he surrenders sole authorship of the song, letting villagers’ phrases reshape the melody. Agency remains his; coincidence is absent. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; persistent constraint (silent wells) dissolves through shared cadence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of communal restoration: cruelty-free ritual still demands surrender of individual control. Subtext lives in gesture—vine touch, bird circle—rather than exposition. Final image of blossoms “like slowly waking eyes” offers non-literal repricing of sacred practice. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in who will tend the song tomorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice retains perceptual signature: brass feathers, glass seeds, clockwork roots catalogued like tinker inventory. Rhythm modulates from long inhalation sentences to the single clear note that snaps the cadence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Filter verbs (“he suspected”) are minimal and motivated; diction stays within tinker’s metaphoric reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but patterned early—readers learn to expect metaphoric catalog, so density feels taught, not accidental. No mixed metaphors; “paths furred with moss” stays physiologically coherent. One paraphrase loop risk: “listened” appears twice in adjacent clauses, but the second is upgraded to embodied act, so loop is minor. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, earning echo without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Freshest inflection: sacredness as shared respiration rather than blood rite. Tinker-as-story-smith trope is familiar, but the sonic botany—roots as tuning pegs—specifically reweights it. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation could alienate, yet pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Transformation test passes: swap any generic mage and the vine-audience chemistry collapses.</comment>
