<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and character-specific; the keeper’s “grip reality loosely” mantra is dramatized through his willingness to let the room reshape around him. The final step onto blank pages is a credible renunciation of neutrality, but the interior contradiction leading to it is stated more than enacted—no moment where judgment almost slips out. Micro-choices under pressure are present yet muffled by lyric summary. Still, the embodiment of centuries of quiet observation feels lived-in and singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s surfacing and the keeper’s seated vigil re-weight “witness without judgment” from detached safety to participatory listening. Cost is legible—the buried archive ruptures the city above, an irreversible breach. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each footprint inks futures, density tightening until paper path and river merge. Transition from catacombs to obsidian refuge is spatially disorienting, but the warp is taught early via origami fold and pays off at the end, so Orientation Test is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Environment charges the final image: obsidian walls drinking dusk and the river of mirrored extinct cities become the literal screen on which futures are drafted. Micro-setting succeeds—origami swan and blank-page path are handled tactilely, constraining each step. Sensory hierarchy matches the keeper’s archivist bias: texture of paper, hush of regenerative silence, visual reflections of lost cities. Selectivity keeps description lean despite lyric abundance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve neutrality vs. enter change—tightens once the paper path unfurls, forcing a literal step into authorship. Escalation is textural: each footprint drafting new cities increases density of responsibility; refusal would leave summoned words formless, a felt price. No reversals, but a single deepening that re-weights the stake from observer to midwife. Cost is visible—library erupts, city disrupted—but could be sharper on his body or identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: witness versus participation, memory versus future. Subtext operates in the swan’s silence and the river’s mirrored extinct cities—peace built on erasure. Final image of keeper seated, swan between palms, refusing to choose among flickering futures, answers the thematic question non-literally: witnessing is now an active, painful holding of potential. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively keeper-ish: patient, tactile, transitive verbs deferred—“glimmered,” “shuddered,” “scattering”—mirroring his loose grip. Rhythm breathes with cavern hush; elongates sentences when shelves warp, shortens at river edge. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression like “crumbling peace” is taught early and repaid at library surfacing. Perceptual signature—dust inhaling memories, vines bookmarking centuries—remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric density flirts with purple but stays purposeful; metaphor stacks (“river… slow ribbon of mirrored stone”) accrete texture without muddling causality. Occasional template cadence—“He… then…” appears twice—minor loop, not at closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line offers charged image. Proofing is clean; no mixed metaphors or synonym churn. High information density: each sentence layers archive, city, keeper psyche.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—librarian of forgotten knowledge summoned by origami history—feels fresh yet inevitable. Regenerative silence and paper-into-stone transformations are specific to this world, not generic magic. Risk in letting setting completely overwrite itself pays off conceptually. Synthesis of archive-as-ecosystem and observer-as-participant reframes familiar witness theme without retreating to allegory.</comment>
