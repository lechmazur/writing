<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tide-dancer’s vocation and exile are viscerally embodied—every ankle-flick carries risk—yet the stranger remains a cipher, their “reckless clarity” told not shown. Mareh’s memory-forfeit is a sharp micro-cost, but the brother-silhouette is abstract; we feel the ache but never knew the face. Interiority is lush, specific, lyric; still, the dyadic crucible never quite ignites because the client’s stakes are sketched in shorthand. The renunciation is earned, the flaw (clandestine empathy) drives the ending, so characterization lands just shy of exceptional.</comment>

<comment>Closure is immaculate: Mareh bites the moon-speck, trades a private memory for a public constellation—an irreversible Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole world. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyric shard adds density until the final droplet sinks and the garden’s mirror reconfigures. Orientation is swift—lagoon, garden, night, outlaw name all within 120 words; no penalty. One hairline slip: the “obsidian grace” phrase recycles three times, a micro-loop that dulls the final cadence by a whisker.</comment>

<comment>The twilight garden is no backdrop but a hydraulic actor: mirrored paths dictate footfall, lantern-moths supply illicit lumens, black-glass roots tether the entire illegal ritual. Micro-setting triumph—moonstone speck becomes ink, lagoon becomes page—so the 9+ gate is met. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mareh notices currents before constellations, salt before tears. Spatial choreography is pristine; skiff approach, water sheet, sleeve reveal track clean across the lagoon plane.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“one forbidden verse”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens with every tide-beat. Escalation is accretive: patrol gaps narrow, moon-speck blossoms, memory sliver shears off—each increment reweights risk. The stranger’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than rescues, satisfying situational pressure. Cost is legible yet diffuse; a sharper visceral price (a blood-drop, a name spoken aloud) would have punched 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from illicit luminescence: memory as contraband light, bodies as smuggled galaxies. No thesis is declared; the final image—stranger’s tear tracking a newborn constellation—re-answers the ban’s void without moralizing. Subtext hums in silence: the garden’s hush is itself a protest, the lost brother-face a negative space we forever feel. Complexity is honored: nostalgia is both wound and weapon, exile both sanctuary and rope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is tidal, syntactically liquid—long swells of clause, sudden droplet fragments—mirroring dancer’s rhythm. Perceptual signature is distinct: law is read in patrol hesitations, history in wave-gap grammar. Elision is taught early (“the cities that outlaw remembering”) and paid off at the bite-to-ink moment. No head-hopping; distance stays tight behind Mareh’s salt-skin. One micro-drift: “obsidian grace” thrice-repeated borders template cadence, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is sonically controlled—sibilance mirrors hush, fricatives mimic surf—“phosphorescent hush” is worth the price of admission. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors setting, escalates stakes, textures body). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; moon-tugged sand never fights glass roots. A single scaffold phrase—“the gaps I have studied” vs “gaps yawn open tonight”—could be compressed, keeping the score just sub-exceptional.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—tide choreography as calligraphy, memory as dermal constellation—feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk is maximal: lyric accumulation in 700 words, world-building via negative space, a client who remains nameless yet carries the arc. The nostalgia ban is freshly inflected through oceanic而不是 bureaucratic metaphors. Specificity anchors universals: lantern-moth dust, molar hollow, freckled galaxy. Transformation test passes: swap names and the piece collapses—proof of irreplaceable vision.</comment>
