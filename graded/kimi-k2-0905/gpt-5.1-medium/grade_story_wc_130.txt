<comment>Corren’s interiority—quiet, mathematic, grief-numbed—rings true in every beat; his shift from retrieval to acceptance is embodied in the tremor that stalls his fingers and the final pocketing of the glass eyes. The brother-shaped absence is kept alive by micro-choices: tracing the mosaic, murmuring ratios, refusing to rip the future-branch. No stock epiphanies—only a measured renunciation that costs him the fantasy of reunion. The Listener of Echoes earns his name through listening, not resurrection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Corren abandons the drag-back spell and accepts the hollow space, felt cost in the orchard’s resumed drip “almost kind.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoed images (glass eyes / stag leap / extra bowl) reweights grief into vocation. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” is named, not dramatized, a fractional abstraction at the pivot beat.</comment>

<comment>The cavern orchard breathes through tactile pressure: damp stone bruising knees, stalactite drips pausing mid-air as if listening. The glass eyes function as micro-setting—handled, repositioned, clouding—constraining the spell’s geometry and charging the final image. Sensory economy is ruthless: one line of mineral dust on the tongue replaces paragraphs of vista. Environment is not backdrop but interlocutor: branches lean, air contracts, silence becomes a kindness he can almost taste.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live with a hole that never finalizes—tightens when the spell fails and the orchard demands a price in futures not his to spend. One meaningful deepening: the shift from retrieval magic to pedagogic stewardship narrows his options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—he pockets the eyes and limps out with the drip-ticking now bearing a cadence he must teach. No external antagonist needed; the missing body is the pressure that finally says stay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of listening to silence: ambiguity not as puzzle but as atmosphere one must learn to breathe. Subtext coils around unfinished motion—stag mid-leap, brother mid-step, drip mid-fall—until the final image reweights absence as vocation. No moralizing; the orchard’s resumed ticking is the non-literal answer. The emotional aftereffect is a hush that feels almost kind, inviting reader complicity in the same stoic mathematics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, precise, slightly fevered—syntax stretches like breath held between drips: “arithmetic of missing steps.” Diction stays within a conjurer-scholar’s lexicon but frays under grief: “fruit that could rewrite memory” collapses into “flavorless dust of unspoken stories.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature holds—Corren notices ratios, taxidermy, unfinished motion. Final line’s spondaic beat (“almost kind”) releases the held breath with tonal closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: one sentence fuses grief, geometry, and orchard respiration—“equations where hope and fear dovetail into spirals neither growing nor shrinking, only circling.” No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-use and biodegradable. Rhythm modulates from incantatory lists to clipped final acceptance. One mixed metaphor—”table steady” after “mismatched pieces”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment>
<comment>Fantasy of memory-fruit is familiar, yet the inversion—orchard that refuses to return the lost—feels freshly cruel. Glass eyes repurposed as scrying lenses give taxidermy a second, spectral life. The “mathematics of emotion” angle risks abstraction but is saved by embodied arithmetic: counting drips, tracing tesserae, balancing absence. Risk taken: lyric stillness over plot reversal; payoff is a hush that lingers.</comment>
