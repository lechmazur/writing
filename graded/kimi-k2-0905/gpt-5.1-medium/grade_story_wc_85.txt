<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The genealogist’s interior contradiction—comforting clients with fake pedigrees while dreading his own erased bloodline—remains concrete and embodied (“every client leaves a new scar,” “scars itch”). Micro-choices (pocketing the broken watch, kneeling to sift driftwood) externalize the hierarchy of values: truth vs self-protection. The final renunciation—vowing to study the real marks instead of forging new ones—pays the cost of abandoning a lucrative identity; causality is clean. Only minor slack: the mother’s repeated tale is summarized, not dramatized, so the earliest shaping of his misbelief is off-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: he gathers the fork-marked driftwood, foreclosing the path of continued erasure while crystallizing the new, risky path of decoding. Cost is legible—“I will return to my trade” implies forfeiting the comfort of ignorance and the income of comforting lies. Causal lens holds throughout: because he recognizes the fork emblem, therefore he reframes his vocation. The note “Ask the shore” acts as telegraphing that pays off; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace, bruised-purple dusk, and salt-slick driftwood heaps are filtered through the narrator’s guilt-narrowed perception; visual and tactile detail guide every beat. The broken watch and forked carving function as micro-setting—objects whose physical state (shattered glass, softened grooves) constrains recognition and choice. Spatial choreography is flawless: tools laid out → railing → steps → sand → wood piles. Environment is not backdrop but archive; the shore’s symbols literally re-write his possible futures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep falsifying pasts or risk exposure by reading the real erased index—tightens the moment the forked emblem is traced. Escalation is causal: recognition of emblem → narrows options to two irrevocable paths, each with visible social/economic cost. No coincidence; the watch缺口 and driftwood groove mirror by design, not luck. Price is on-page: he pockets the wood, accepting the danger of resurrecting names his father died to hide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the impossibility of softening history without amputating identity. Subtext resides in object handling—watch missing its hand = narrative missing its joint. Final image of stacking “fragile bones” reweights prior forgery as a kind of grave-robbing. Moral complexity stays intact: father’s heroism and cruelty, son’s complicity and atonement are braided, not balanced into tidy verdict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a forensic lyricism—“sieved hush,” “genealogy of people allowed to begin again”—that feels specific to a man who has typed false certainties for years. Perceptual signature notices negative space: absent watch hand, missing name, unspoken words. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into short clauses at recognition—“snaps something…like a bone.” No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside guilty retrospection. Register never drifts into academic or self-help; diction remains maritime, archival, and tactile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with discovery: long, tide-like sentences roll toward revelation, then crack into staccato fragments at epiphany. Metaphors are coherent—time as pulsing watch, erased lives as driftwood softened by salt—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances knowledge or cost. High information density: “I forged documents that severed me from my blood” performs backstory, motive, and crime in one line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The black-market genealogist who secretly rewrites his own past to nullify a smuggler-father is a fresh, high-concept synthesis. Driftwood cipher-index as archive of the erased feels inevitable yet unfamiliar. Risky structural choice—lyric, reflective mode with single on-page character—heightens rather than dilutes stakes. Specificity of forked emblem and broken watch prevents abstraction; without them the concept collapses.</comment>
