<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s paradoxical youth/age and Mora’s anticipatory tremor are viscerally embodied; the refusal to deliver spectacle is a credible, high-cost stance. Micro-choices—palm opening, basin brightening—map precisely to “withhold” motive. Interior contradiction is present yet mild; the lesson lands as renunciation rather than irreversible loss, capping score at 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: Mora’s hollow is felt, Elian’s refusal forecloses the expected spectacle, and the cost is the apprentice’s new dread. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—rings, hush, magnetic hum tighten meaning until the final image reweights vanishing as responsibility, not escape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto and floating platform constrain every spatial choice; the basin’s upward-drawn water is a tool that enables the lesson’s core demonstration. Sycamore hush returns as audible texture during the trance, bridging external and internal states. Final image of “who she would choose to be” is charged by these anchors, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mora’s desire to witness disappearance—faces a single deepening: the realization that vanishing is a responsibility, not a trick. Escalation is textural: each ripple dilutes her name until the hollow becomes palpable. Cost is legible in her returned memory’s “painful and bright” rush; agency is attention/acceptance rather than active reversal, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: vanishing is slow, ethical, inward. The sycamore hush and magnetic grid become objective correlatives for silence and restraint. Final refusal avoids moralizing yet reweights the entire premise—disappearance is not power but cost. Ambiguity lingers cleanly: Mora must decide what deserves to remain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—attention to “spaces between rings,” “taste of stone and metal in the air.” Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences during trance, abrupt “Then the memory… rushed back” for sting. No head-hopping; compression in “years of erosion ahead” is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, causal work; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent: ripple-rings = dilution of self. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by instructor voice. Final line cadence is crisp, propulsive; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Backwards-aging mentor teaching anti-spectacle vanishing via magnetic pond ripples is a fresh synthesis of familiar mystic tropes. Specificity of iron-veined stone, upward-drawn basin water makes the concept tactile. Risk—refusal of expected spectacle—heightens coherence; payoff is the hollow Mora carries away. Could not swap grotto for generic cave without breaking mechanics.</comment>
