<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Luminous-glass identity is shown more than told; interiority is sensuous and specific. The slow, glass-cool pacing mirrors the narrator’s adaptive stance, but micro-choices are mostly passive observations until the final walk. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; survival guilt and creative loss are asserted, not dramatized. Closure cost is present yet feels conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist steps beyond the ruins, re-weighted by the ledger’s arrow-trace. Accumulative-textural lens is stable—density of frost/charcoal/glass imagery tightens stakes rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by line 4; shards are legible. The withheld name of the smuggler is purposeful elision, not knowledge cheat; still, the DC/RR beat is quiet—felt cost is oblique, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Canyon and kiln function as micro-setting: cracked foundation constrains movement, charcoal dust stains fingers, furnace cavity literally shapes the danger. Frost on window is not postcard filler—it maps the ledger’s tributaries, fusing setting to clue. Starlight “developing” the paper is a concrete environmental act that charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds through single night-walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why someone weaponised the kiln—survives the whole piece, tightening when ledger arrows redirect the walk. Agency is the decision to follow the charcoal trail rather than flee; cost is the reopened risk of confronting the smuggler. Escalation is textural: each new image (frost map, sun symbol, canyon echo) reweights danger rather than forcing external twists. Coincidence stays complication, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass/light/charcoal triad quietly reframes survival as transmutation instead of revenge—theme emerges from imagery, not dictum. Scorched testament motif re-prices art itself: creation can be turned into weapon, witness, map. No late moralizing; final image of “glass returning to sand” gives cyclical resonance. Ambiguity stays fertile: survivor may reclaim craft or shatter again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, glass-blower’s perceptual signature: every observation is filtered through translucence, fracture, heat-cool cycles. Diction stays within artisan lexicon—“anneal,” “kiln,” “rod”—without showing off. Rhythm modulates: longer liquid sentences during remembering, clipped fragments at blast memory. No head-hop; unreliability hinted yet not contradicted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors are disciplined—vehicles stay inside glass/charcoal/frost realm; no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths ebb and flow like breath. One scaffold loop: “learning to…/I called it…” repeats concept but adds nuance each time, forgiven. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, resonant, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Glass-artist-survivor-as-detective angle feels fresh; artisan process fused to criminal evidence is specific. Scorched ledger strip is a sharp, non-generic MacGuffin. Frost/charcoal map echo is an elegant pattern not seen in stock revenge arcs. Could swap canyon for any remote ruin, so locale is less singular; late introduction of unnamed smuggler slightly lessens personal twist.</comment>
