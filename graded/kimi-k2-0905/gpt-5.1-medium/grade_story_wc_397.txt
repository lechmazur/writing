<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The interior contradiction—wanting to die yet listening for the sound of continuance—is dramatized in every micro-choice (renting the bunk, cataloguing debris, tapping the parasol). The heirloom’s re-purposing as tuning fork and the final moment of “undecided” vibration show embodied emotion rather than labels. The decision to turn back is earned by the prior causal chain of listening, not an epiphany. Flaw: “grips reality loosely” is named once without visible cost; still, the speaker’s perceptual warp is shown elsewhere.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the vibration in the water reweights the premise, making the cost of living/dying legible without declaring either. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → tactile objects → ice music accumulates until the final image folds patience open. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the week-long wait—shapes every tactic. Cost is undeniable in the final image: “a narrow but undeniable path back” carries social, existential price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop; the creak/kiss of floes supplies the actual sound the protagonist came to hear, hence directly charges closure. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its ivory state altering as it moves from relic to tuning fork to water-contact sensor. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → bunk → boat three → cut engine → water-touch. Weather (razor air, fog breath) affects action (coat unbuttoned, motor cough). Specificity is selective: no tourist catalogue, only the details that vibrate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn the sound of endings so as to decide on ending—tightens when the sound turns out to be continuance, forcing a stance shift. Single meaningful escalation: catalogue-recycling taxonomy becomes rehearsal for self-classification (repairable/irretrievable), then the vibration forecloses suicide. Cost is felt: the clinic path is now “undecided,” social permission forfeited. Agency stays with protagonist: choosing dawn departure, cutting engine, holding tip to water.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ice-floe music and taxonomic piles: ending is not an event but a daily hesitation. Subtext in the parasol’s shift from shade to antenna reframes memory as instrument rather than relic. Final image answers the thematic question without moral: continuance is a vibration you can choose to hear. No tidy thesis—reader left with cost of re-entry into life that has no promise of healing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distilled lyric first-person with idiosyncratic noticing (“slow, indecisive continents”). Syntax mirrors mind: long sentences for drift, fragmentary beats for cold shock. No head-hopping; Runa’s speech is filtered through protagonist’s ear. Register stable—elevated diction justified by reflective cast. Parasol “tuning fork” metaphor taught early and paid off at climax; no strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchoring, metaphor, pressure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—sparse in high-pressure engine-start beat, richer in static listening beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor slip: “colorless sky” is generic amid otherwise exact detail; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism meets disaster-recycling taxonomy meets ice acoustics. Conceptual risk—using vibration as plot engine—paid off in literalized metaphor at closure. Familiar trauma-recovery arc is re-invented through sound archaeology. Specificity of drift-ice marina and parasol tip prevents swap-out test failure. No derivative echo of famous lines.</comment>
