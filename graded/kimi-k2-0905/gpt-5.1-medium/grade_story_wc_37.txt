<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is richly particular—her hands shake as she sings back through a shard, revealing a hierarchy of values (mercy vs. memory) that compounds into irrevocable cost when the satchel empties. Contradictory impulses—clinging to forgetting vs. forcing remembrance—coexist in the same beat, making her final act feel earned rather than symbolic. The only bar to 9+ is that the realm’s people remain off-stage silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mica window brightens not because an external sky returns but because the populace’s returned memories refract through them, reweighting the realm’s survival with undeniable conceptual cost—“the realm shuddered under the sudden honesty.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each shard-released memory tightens the chord of song that Mara threads backward until the window can no longer absorb starlight but must throw back color. Lens holds from first chiming root to last vanishing weight in the satchel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The black-mica ceiling and glass-root soil are not postcard garnish; their refusal to admit daylight forces the entire memory-restoration gambit, and their final color-refraction is the visual proof that the tactic worked. Spatial choreography stays clean—Mara’s satchel, the tagged pear trees, and the window form a straight path whose every step is tactile (ash-filmed fruit, chiming under-soil). Micro-setting gate cleared: the window’s re-crystallized surface literally powers the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—realm survival through painful remembrance—tightens exactly once but profoundly: when Mara decides to un-swaddle the oldest song-shard, trading her role as merciful carrier for the harsher office of communal mirror. That act narrows her options to irreversible; the satchel empties onstage and the realm’s “sudden honesty” is the visible price. Agency is accumulative under lyric lens: one decisive release that reweights all prior hoarded grief into living dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the story equates collective amnesia with ecological death, and memory’s return with literal light-refracting dawn. The pear trees’ ash film and the mica’s star-drunk darkness are concrete particulars that reweight into the final polychrome flash, offering a non-verbal answer to “what makes a world worth the pain of history?” No character ever utters a thesis line; insight is encoded in the window’s color burst and the satchel’s sudden lightness—Conceptual Repricing achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices “bracelets of fractures” and “sunsets trapped like embers,” never sliding into tourist catalog. Syntax breathes with her tremor—fragments tighten into short clauses as she lifts the oldest shard, then elongate into the released song. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; patterned elision (e.g., “Silence Years” as noun-phrase) is taught early and paid off when sound returns. Distinctive rhythmic signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical—no template cadence, no synonym loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“sunsets…like sleeping embers”) and serve information density. One minor purple patch—“chapel of trees”/“lung of creation” in opening—doesn’t obscure causality but keeps this shy of 9+. Final third is artifact-free; the dawn refraction image is clean, potent, and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The memory-keeper who un-stores pain to restart a photosynthetic dawn is fresh synthesis; the mica-window-as-social-mirror and song-as-breath are non-obvious extensions of familiar fantasy tropes. Specificity (“tag inscribed not with a name, but with a memory”) prevents allegorical drift. Risky lyric structure commits fully and pays off in the color-burst closure without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the whole engine collapses.</comment>
