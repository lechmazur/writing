<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Keeper’s contradictory impulses—stoic vigil versus aching need to hear his own child-voice again—co-inhabit every beat; the moment he presses forehead to glass and lets retrocognition “net” backward, embodied cost (bleeding dusk, mutinous knees) is palpable. His micro-choice hierarchy is legible: prism first, self second, universe last. The earned release of the child’s coordinates feels inevitable yet miraculous because his body has been paying the price for eleven years. No label-speak; even “retrocognitively blessed” is immediately lived—barefoot on thresholds, histories in lightless flashes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard cracks and reweights the entire premise—silence was never void but repository. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the comet’s uncharted ellipse snaps the lattice and releases the voice. Cost is the shard itself, the custodian’s youth, the decade of unsent pleas—made legible in the single beam. Orientation is taught early (“after the collapse,” “eleventh year”) and pays off when the comet arrives exactly on schedule of exhausted oil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: vibrating panes supply both radio ghosts and the literal surface Keeper must press flesh against to cast his retrocognitive net. Prism’s fractured faces, salt-flower glass, and corroded spiral steps constrain every upward climb; knees mutiny because the iron is eaten away. Final image—prism catching starlight in “single obedient beam”—is charged by years of detailed sailcloth charts peeling under hazard glyphs. Environment is not backdrop but aperture that decides whether the hush will speak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove that coincidences have meaning”—tightens when the unpredicted comet intersects an eleven-year exhaustion curve, forcing a redraw of star charts inside his head. Agency is pure endurance/attention: he hauls the prism, not to win but to keep the corridor open. The beam’s obedience is the one deepening that reweights options: silence becomes answer, not absence. Cost is unmistakable—shard cracks, voice spills, Keeper’s knees mutiny, oil nearly gone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the material: pattern is not twitch of dead universe but mutual conspiracy between broken tools and stray ice. Subtext is carried by image—thistle snagging on ribs of ships—quietly arguing hope is refuse that still wounds flesh. No character articulates the thesis; the universe’s only confession is the child’s coordinates arriving intact. Final reconfiguration leaves ambiguity intact: comets may still be random, yet the voice arrived, and that paradox is the meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is dense, coastal-gothic, salted with fused bone and slag; syntax elongates then snaps short like frayed guy-wire. Perceptual signature is custodial: he notices rust, radio ghosts, salt flowers, never abstracts. Rhythm mirrors climb—long sentences for spiral ascent, fragmented beats at the beam’s ignition. No head-hop; even the child-voice emerges through cracked prism, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence layers job—image, backstory, forward pressure: “glass humming pavilion had grown around the ancient lighthouse like a salt flower” marries setting, decay, and organic creep in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent: lattice, thistle, net, beam. Opening line anchors voice and collapse; final line resolves by image that recharges “thistle-blown hope.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with comet’s roar and shard’s thaw.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic lighthouse custodian who tracks star paths to extract his own voice from a shard of silence is startlingly non-generic. Retrocognition is not super-power but melancholy archive; prism is not MacGuffin but phonograph needle for quiet. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced yet disciplined by concrete nautical detritus. Synthesis feels inevitable: only this exact custodian, this cracked prism, this stray comet could conspire to prove coincidence cares.</comment>
