<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is textured—echoes of unsent love letters as “a private archive” shows embodied contradiction—but the core want (find the thread) stays verbal, never crystallizing into a decisive on-page act. The final slackening is felt, yet it leans on atmospheric release rather than a visible choice that costs the ghostwriter a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural pattern is legible: storm → temple → spiral → letter; each beat layers density until the oculus-light mirror reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—light turning stone to mirror reconfigures the archive of unsaid things—but the cost is more atmospheric than corporeal, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pond-temple complex is sensory and cinematic—“petals carved in marble unfolding toward an unseen sky” anchors scale while rainwater ticking through hidden channels gives tactile immediacy. The thrush-nest spiral functions as micro-setting that seeds the spiral walkway, constraining the architect’s offer and the narrator’s final text; this object-driven constraint earns the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—write a letter that strangers can inhabit—tightens once: the architect insists the first object must choose itself, forcing the narrator to weave private echoes into public text. Escalation is textural rather than causal, a deepening of pressure toward communal exposure; the cost is the surrender of anonymity, felt but not dramatized as a forked path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the communal afterlife of private fragments; the final image of stone become mirror re-prices the ghostwriter’s trade, turning hidden grief into shared surface. No moral is stated—only the shimmer of light on wet marble—achieving resonance through conceptual reweighting rather than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lyrical, slightly antiquarian diction—“lotus milk,” “prismatic quiet”—that feels consistent with a scribe who hoards half-finished sentiments. Syntax lengthens in clauses that mimic spiral turns, then shortens at relief: “a slackening of invisible knots,” showing rhythmic control under pressure without head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense but purposeful—nest as “home strong enough to cradle breath” mirrors the temple as cradle for communal memory—no mixed vehicles break logic. Occasional template cadence (“I think… I write… I do not name…”) appears, yet it serves the spiral motif and never obscures the final mirror-image, so artifacts stay below the 9-block threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The conceit of a monument built from unfinished love letters is fresh, and the inversion—commissioning the ghostwriter to script the foundation text—flips the usual confidentiality pact. Risk lies in the lyric swirl of metaphor; it pays off via the light-mirror reconfiguration, making the freshness feel inevitable rather than ornamental.</comment>
