<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the crab-skittering unease—stays embodied in micro-choices (tracing sigils, kneeling to whisper findings). The renunciation at the end (leaving paths blank-labeled “Not yet”) carries felt cost: he forfeits finality for custodianship, a stance crystallized through the crater-glass beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds: each seed-tunnel beat deepens texture and reweights the stake from “solve disappearance” to “witness deferral.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—unfinished crystal meaning “postponed, not stolen”—with visible cost: Lio’s ledger now carries blank pages he must guard until the world finishes deciding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The geode’s color-shifts and dry-foam surf constrain every move; the crater glass is handled twice, its star-pocked surface charging the final image. Micro-setting (unfinished crystal seam) literally halts footsteps, forcing Lio’s renunciation—environment as active agent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths vanish”—tightens from mystery to stewardship once the unfinished crystal is revealed. Agency remains observational, yet the cost is visceral: he must catalog absence instead of presence, a trade-off legible in the blank ledger symbols.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted images: memory as sea-foam, roads as seeds, erasure as mercy. Final reconfiguration—blank pages labeled “soon”—reweights erasure into incubation without moralizing, achieving quiet cosmic resonance.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is sea-salt specific: “cuttlefish jokes” ink, “drunken cartwheels” of paths. Rhythmic modulation mirrors Lio’s cheerful gloom—measured cadence under fog-whistling sorrow—held stable under pressure with no filter-verb drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence music varies from crystalline clauses to surf-like enjambment; no scaffold or mixed metaphors. High density achieved via nouns that do double duty (“footprints tattooed”), propelling momentum without cluttering the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—foam as memory archive—feels inevitable yet fresh; meteor-seawater glass and unfinished crystal seam extend the conceit without gimmick. Cheerful gloom as tonal constant is a risky synthesis that heightens coherence rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
