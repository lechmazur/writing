<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—paid to map ignorance yet haunted by the human cost—drives every beat; the trembling hand before the nib is the visible price of his earned choice. No stock interiority; his noticing is cartographer-precise (“circles, arrows, and numbers in charcoal”) and his body fails under pressure (“eyes burned… thoughts frayed like worn rope”). The flaw is the same trait that empowers him: predictive imagination that could bury strangers. Final micro-choice—lowering the nib—forecloses every other future and is legible as cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the snows advance farther, therefore Elian must invent leap-frog roads; because he refuses to bury villagers, therefore he bends policy not breaks it. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: ink now commits the kingdom to a adaptive, non-sacrifice future—cost is the irrevocable stroke and the king’s future wrath if it fails. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by sentence three. Persistent constraint (third-year thaw pulse) shapes the final tactic and is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher-feather micro-setting all constrain the choice: the spire’s hoarded reflections mirror Elian’s hoarded futures; the lake’s muteness externalizes the silence he must break with ink. Tool-detail (“pen without a nib”) is tactile and stakes-loaded. Weather is not backdrop but causal—snow advance collapses a village and forces the new model. Final image re-uses the spire’s black glass to refract the fresh map-lines, recharging the opening metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save northern lives without conscription to death—signalled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the three-year thaw pulse collapses static-road plans and forces the adaptive arc tactic; cost is the political risk of asking “more of the kingdom.” No coincidence; pressure escalates via data fragments that tighten the noose of responsibility. Final stroke crystallizes the trade-off: innovation within constraint, not conquest over winter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as responsibility, not power—emerges from Elian’s refusal to let maps remain bloodless abstractions. No manifesto lines; meaning accrues through recurring images of “blank vellum” versus “living shard of river water.” Final image reweights the premise: the future is not conquered but negotiated with ice. Ambiguity lingers: the plan may still fail, leaving reader with felt cost rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s cartographer gaze: temperature charts, charcoal notations, probability coastlines. Syntax mirrors his lattice mindset (“if and then, of risk and reward”). No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate (“pressed numb fingers”). Voice modulates under fatigue—sentences fragment as thoughts fray. Final uplift in diction (“something fierce and almost joyful”) is earned by prior compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (world-rule, interior, foreshadow). Metaphors are precise—“frozen bolt of night,” “thoughts frayed like worn rope”—and never mixed. No scaffold; each paragraph advances either data tension or moral pressure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final pen-stroke, then stops on the single-word future—perfect cadence match.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the familiar “prophecy” trope: here the seer must choose which future becomes fact, not merely reveal it. Third-year pulse logistics feel freshly invented rather than hand-waved. Kingfisher feather as nib fuses beauty and fragility into a single object that literalizes “living ink.” If swapped for a goose quill, the charge would collapse. Risk taken—quiet ending, no battle—pays off through conceptual repricing.</comment>
