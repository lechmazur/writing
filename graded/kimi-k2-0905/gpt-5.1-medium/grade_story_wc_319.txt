<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “dimensionally homesick” narrator’s ache is lived in every beat: the mist tastes of paper dust, the pendant corridor forces a literal self-confrontation, and the final acceptance of perpetual uncertainty carries embodied cost. Guardian’s thorn-feet, ember-pendant sniff, and refusal to name herself all manifest her contract-bound ferality. Interior contradiction—craving both exit and enclosure—drives every micro-choice; the moment the narrator pockets the pendant he simultaneously surrenders and claims agency. The only polish missing is a hairline beat where the guardian’s personal stake in his choice surfaces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the library garden hardens into a single corridor, pendant accepted, “uncertainty arrives in different costumes” crystallizes both option and cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each imagistic shard (hoarfrost paper-dust, lantern-glass, margin-note identity) layers density until the final pause re-weights the stake. Causality is lyric but legible: because the narrator confesses friendship with doubt, therefore the guardian grants the threshold tool. Cost is visible in the instant he sees his exhausted alter-ego—proof that the ache is endless yet portable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen fountain as paused question-mark, ember trapped inside dull glass, marble bench biting through clothes—every object is micro-setting that constrains stance. The “boundaries of light” corridor is not metaphor but physical pass/fail: step past, lose shadow; stay, remain caged. Sensory economy is ruthless: only taste (paper dust), temperature (clean cold), and sight (ember flicker) are allowed, each filtered through the narrator’s map-making bias. Spatial choreography is pristine; guardian crouched at far path end, pendant dangled exactly between them, narrator’s step-by-step clock-ticking advance all track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the library let him leave, and does he even want to?—is signaled in line one and tightened only once: when the pendant corridor reveals the price of either choice. That single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens; the pattern of images (fog, frost, glass, lantern) accumulates until the final image re-prices both options. Agency is present: he walks, sits, reaches, pockets the pendant; each micro-action forecloses the fantasy of a final answer. Cost is legible in the alter-ego vision—exhaustion made visible—and in the guardian’s parting warning to “write in the margins,” i.e., accept perpetual provisionality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—uncertainty not as problem but companion—emerges entirely through imagic particulars: margin-note identity, lantern-flame as cage, pendant that shows only corridors without exits. The final line “waiting, uncertain, almost kind” offers resonant non-literal answer: no moral, only a stance that reconfigures prior ache as alliance. Subtext operates in gesture: guardian sniffing air like a cat is threat-assessment rather than greeting, revealing her true metric—trust is bodily, not contractual. No abstract thesis ever declared; the reader feels the theme as pressure in throat-frost and glass-warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature—cartographic metaphors, cataloguing of impossible exits, sensitivity to axial displacement—that never leaks into guardian-speak. Compression taught early: “interiorizing exteriors” is defined on first use and paid off when garden resolves into library corridor. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clause-pile during pendant vision, then staccato “Why not both” at climax. Diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon yet achieves texture: “feral,” “lucidity,” “dimensionally homesick” all feel coined for private need rather than thesaurus show.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, no scaffold loops. One mixed-metaphor risk—“waiting sounded like every day of my life”—is rescued by specificity of reluctant-clock simile immediately after. Information density high: single line “bushes became clauses, statues punctuation” performs scene-work, character-work, and concept-work simultaneously. Minor template cadence in three successive “and” openers mid-story (−0.2); but artifact never touches closure beat, so 9-band still reachable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>“Library that rearranges reality to house your homesickness” is fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy trope; here the portal is not escape but admission that no exit exists. Pendant showing corridor of caged lanterns re-weights light itself as antagonist—non-obvious conceptual twist. Risky second-person address (“you crossed without knocking”) is earned because guardian’s grammar of accusation requires it. Specific detail—thorns in bare feet, paper-dust taste—prevents conceptual coolness from drifting into abstraction; transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving idiosyncratic DNA.</comment>
