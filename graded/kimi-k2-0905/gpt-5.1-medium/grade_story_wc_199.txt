<comment>Lio’s fear of “almost but not quite knowing” gives a sharp interior contradiction that steers every micro-choice; the shift from passive sorting to active planting is legibly traced through prior causality and carries visible cost (the arbor’s embrace, the valley’s new story). Interiority stays concrete—”mossy delight tingling in veins”—never slipping into diagnostic speak. The monuments to forgotten things externalize values without abstract label, showing hierarchy in action. One flaw: the moment of decision is slightly under-dramatized—Lio’s final yes is reported more than embodied, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: planting the questions re-weights the entire arbor/valley rule-set and the moonstone-bearing leaf makes the cost undeniable. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of leaves, seeds, monuments accumulates until the cadence shift at “the valley felt a new story beginning.” Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3, no disorientation. One minor softening: the voice’s invitation (“Will you plant them”) is the first external prompt Lio obeys, so the decisive act is partly bestowed rather than wholly self-generated; still, the prior refusal to plant is clearly motivated, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<comment>Environment and tool converge in the final beat: the arbor’s hollowed trunk, grooved niches, and root-floor literally constrain the planting act and charge the closing image. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Lio notices weight, color, forgotten-wind angle—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (seed grooves, bark crescent) doubles as stage for monuments, so spatial choreography stays legible. The moonstone speck is a recurring object whose final gleam re-illuminates the entire map-leaf, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the message”—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone map reveals the monuments already echo ghost rivers, forcing the choice: keep sorting or plant. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens: each sorted seed and monument adds density until the new leaf breaks pattern. Cost is visible: Lio forfeits the safety of perpetual listening, accepts transformation the valley exacts on every successful reader. No external antagonist needed; internal fear of misunderstanding supplies coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: only by relinquishing decoding (planting questions) can the valley receive answers. Subtext resides in the monuments—absence made tactile—so the final reconfiguration hits as lived insight rather than moral. No tidy thesis is stated; the valley’s “new story beginning” is an image, not a lesson. Earlier motif of “almost falling” seed column pays off in the planted seeds that now may fall and grow, proving recurrence was pressure, not ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Lio’s perceptual signature—sorting by weight of forgotten winds, feeling coolness “mossy delight” in veins. Syntax mirrors obsessive order: parallel seed clauses, then fractures into shorter beats under arbor’s creak. No head-hop; voice never explains what Lio already knows. Diction—“skyborne arbor,” “cryptic as seeds in drought”—is elevated yet consistent with folktale register. Final line’s cadence shift to open future is earned and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet lucid: single sentences carry image, myth, and causality (“leaf trembled around it as though bearing an entire winter”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; figurative language is selective, never crowding high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases them. One hairline slip: “dust speck” is repeated twice in quick succession—minor tautology, not touching closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating question-tree that drops answer-leaves—takes folkloric trope but roots it in never-sent letters and bridge-lost words, making abstraction intimate. Risk of conceptual piece is high, yet commitment never wavers: every detail (monuments, moonstone map) grows from the core rule. Synthesis feels inevitable: sorting without planting is another form of forgetting. Transformation test fails—story collapses if Lio is a mason or the arbor is grounded. Fresh inflection: the reader must realize the alphabet was already built, not decoded.</comment>
