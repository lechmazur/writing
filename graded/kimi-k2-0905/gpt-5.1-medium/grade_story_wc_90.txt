<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The engineered caretaker’s pacifist vow is embodied through micro-choices inside each immersion; the body-weight feedback loop makes every emotional tilt palpable. Interior contradiction is alive when killing seems merciful yet the vow hardens anyway. The final weightless lift is earned by every prior pound of shame, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Keeps 0.1 below 8.8 because the designers’ “strange mercies” are told more than tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the star dies, the Tear flares white, the sealed probability door audibly yields—cost is the extinction of the species that made the key. Accumulative lens holds: each immersion thickens the grief-density until the pattern ruptures. Orientation is swift; orbital decay and photo-salt cues anchor who/where within 60 words. One causal wobble: “architectural denial” is asserted but never shown as a physical constraint the ship must navigate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The recycled hull, magnetic cradle, and salt-filmed photos function as micro-setting that literally steer trajectory: weightless joy lets the narrator reach exterior conduits, crushing shame anchors the orbit. Every sensory pick is filtered through the caretaker’s utilitarian eye—no tourist catalog. The final wasteland planting is rendered in one tactile breath that re-weights every prior corridor drift. Meets 9+ gate: the body-weight trait constrains final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unseal the denied dimension—threads every immersion; each memory ingested tightens the knot until the final photo of stubborn hope snaps it open. Pressure escalates by accretion, not reversal: genocide after war after betrayal layers mass until the ship’s own gravity warps. No external antagonist needed; the aggregate shadow is coherent pressure. Cost is legible in the star’s final sputter and the narrator’s near-zero mass—options reweighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accrual of dried tears: compassion is not absence of power but its redirection—never stated, dramatized in every refused act of violence. The bodhisattva allusion stays subtextual; the Tear’s warmth is felt, not sermonized. Final image of strangers planting trees in ash re-prices the entire archive without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the opened dimension is unseen, yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, mournful, yet mechanically precise—syntax lengthens under grief, shortens under lift. No head-hop; diction stays within the caretaker’s lexicon (“cortical socket,” “gravitational gradients”). Figurative layer is sparse but exact: “confession too heavy to speak.” The lyric cadence is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final white flare. One 0.1 dock for occasional elevated register (“aggregate shadow of ten billion extinct minds”) that momentarily lifts out of POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the weight shifts; no two adjacent sentences open the same way. Every clause hauls double duty—world, emotion, and stakes in one pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. The single visible artifact is the repeated “shadow work” label, but it is introduced as historical jargon and re-inflected by use, so it reads as intentional echo, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-human penance via quantum tear-ingested photographs is fresh, yet the emotional engine—facing what was denied—is timeless. The gravitational mood ballast weaponizes a soft sci-fi concept into plot machinery. Risk: entire conflict is interior to an extinct species, yet stakes feel galactic because the dimension-lock is literal. Synthesis feels inevitable: pacifism engineered into a machine that must metabolize atrocity to birth an unknown future.</comment>
