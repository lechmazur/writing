<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier’s jitters, embodied in the clicking boots, feel real and particular, but the decisive interior shift—deciding to linger everywhere—arrives in a single abstract sentence without a micro-choice dramatized on the page, so the cost is announced rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the courier re-weights his life-rule from constant motion to deliberate lingering; the pendant’s sympathetic vibration and the aurora’s hush provide the visible, felt cost, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens whose pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is never a postcard; its light presses against skin, snow soaks trousers, and the pendant’s micro-setting becomes the tool that reconfigures time itself, charging the final image with undeniable constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: the pendant’s unexpected glow forces a middle beat of stillness that forecloses the courier’s lifelong reflex to keep moving; the cost is visible (kneeling in wet snow, temporal vertigo), satisfying the single meaningful deepening required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder as a doorway that opens both outward toward others and inward toward one’s own slowed time; the final non-literal image of the pendant as “trembling lantern” reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured throughout—“jittery staccato,” “carbonated water,” “slow glass”—and the perceptual signature of a man who notices relic-hum and aurora-curves remains stable; no head-hopping, no register drift, and the lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences do dual duty (action + atmosphere); only one soft scaffold (“the sensation ran…”) and no mixed metaphors; final line crystallizes without overwriting, meeting the high-band gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The relic-courier trope is refreshed by turning memory into a literal time-layer one can kneel inside; the sympathetic aurora-pendant mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight, though the core idea of wonder-as-doorway flirts with familiar lyric territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup via clicking boots; middle development when jitter freezes into stillness; closure participation when the same jitter converts to the decision to linger—cost is the soaked knees and temporal vertigo.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Setup in pocket, mid-scene beat when it first vibrates, final beat as trembling lantern that reweights the courier’s life-rule; without it the time-layer and decision collapse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Absent mentor shapes tactics—carry gently, speak briefly—visible in early rules; middle when pendant glow hints at sideways step; closure when courier realizes mentor’s instruction was the doorway map.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Trait signaled early; enables the climactic stillness that germinates wonder in himself; cost is forfeited momentum and soaked knees.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Verb appears in pivotal beat—courier kneels to germinate wonder in himself first; without this act the final decision never roots.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Mechanic seeded as “humming relics,” taught by aurora sync, drives the single decisive tightening; without sympathetic vibration the time-layer stays sealed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ridgeway pressures the choice—exposed height forces aurora exposure, snow soaks knees, spatial isolation permits temporal vertigo; final image is inseparable from this ridge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>“Fade from memory to myth” is the conceptual clock; courier’s realization that moments can stretch reweights his future pacing; time is thematic rather than tactical, so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Motivation stated early, conflicted mid-scene when routine speed collides with aurora hush, and resolved by on-page decision to linger; cost is forfeited speed and soaked knees.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Tone modulates from anxious staccato to slowed wonder; final hush is coherent with aurora-lit transcendence and charges the last image.</comment>
