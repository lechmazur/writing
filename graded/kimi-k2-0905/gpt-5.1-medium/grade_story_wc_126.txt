<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elio’s interiority is textured—sound as a second heartbeat, the bow that stalls before cadence—yet the decisive shift from “playing for coins” to “listening bowl” feels lightly motivated; the causal bridge between Mara’s invitation and his renunciation is more lyrical than dramatized, so the cost is felt but not fully earned under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inverted bowl converts begging into listening, reweighting the premise with undeniable social and aesthetic cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of unfinished phrases, pumps that hate finishing cycles—and the final image crystallizes that cadence. Orientation is swift; anchors (harbor city, drained canal, porthole balcony) are clear by line 60. One micro-turn: Mara’s card flips the hush open for Elio, deepening stakes without breaking pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass ribs, diving-suit ghosts, barnacled pipes—each detail is filtered through Elio’s acoustic bias and later constrains the final image when the upside-down bowl catches “unfinished echoes.” The greenhouse micro-setting literally shapes the closing gesture; removing it would collapse the conceptual reprice. Sensory hierarchy favors rust, lime, distant tides—precise, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can unfinished sound still matter in a city that muffles everything? Pressure tightens when Mara reframes the hush as opportunity rather than lack; the pumps’ almost-failures embody the same aesthetic. Cost is visible—coins poured out, bowl inverted—yet the external risk (hunger, exposure) stays sub-textual, so the escalation is more cadence-driven than consequence-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via pattern: beauty = refusal to complete. From bonfire tales to bow stalls to pumps that stop short, the idea accrues material weight; the final image of the listening bowl reprises it without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—does the city notice?—and the reader is left to finish the chord, fulfilling the thesis obliquely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elio’s auditory cortex; perceptual signature is consistent—“smears of resonance,” “syllables of regret.” Syntax lengthens and pauses to mimic bow hesitations; no head-hop. Compression (“smoke braided the stars”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—shell, cathedral, applause—each recharged at closure. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One scaffold risk: “unfinished” recurs eight times; because it is the thematic piston, the repetition reads intentional rather than artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise fuses climate-grief, post-industrial salvage, and acoustic hauntology into a single image-set; the listening bowl inversion feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk: lyric refusal of plot beats could have flattened stakes, but the accumulative pattern holds. Fresh inflection—diving-suit orchards—grounds the surreal in tactile detail.</comment>
