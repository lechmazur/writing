<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet expertise and “wilts near dishonesty” quirk are vividly embodied; the interior contradiction between fixing songs and refusing false bargains drives every beat. Yet the Mayor remains a functional prop: no status shift, no competing desire, only expository pressure. The earned cost—Elias trades his secret melody and permanently warms the blackwood box—lands, but the external relationship stays static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dishonest rust → shard fracture → Elias offers truthful song → covenant rewired → light restored. The resonance chamber reveals the stakes at the ⅔ mark, tightening options to “sing or stay dark.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city breathes, the box stays warm—felt cost visible in Elias’s emptied lungs and the Mayor’s lantern newly honest. One scaffold loop (“the rust… the rust…”) nicks clarity but does not break the image.</comment>

<comment>Setting is the chamber itself: stone sphere of dangling chimes whose acoustic logic forces Elias to externalize his repair as song. Micro-setting—the blackwood box with its “ring of polished emptiness”—literally contains the fix and later carries residual heat as proof. Spatial choreography stays crisp: droplets ring, rust recoils, light seeps along metal. The environment is not backdrop; it is the instrument Elias plays.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen dawn—is signaled inside 70 words and narrows to “sing truth or eternal gray.” One meaningful tightening: when Elias breathes the unspoken melody, surrendering personal secrecy becomes the only currency left. Cost is audible—his knees soften, the box warms—but the external city re-lighting happens off-stage, slightly diluting visceral price. Still, agency is his; no coincidence resolves the dark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: truth is not hammered but resonated into being. The Covenant of Rust embodies broken promises that crave honest vibration; Elias’s willingness to surrender his hidden song reframes “repair” as self-gift rather than mending. Subtext lingers in the warmed box—personal cost for public dawn—without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: will the covenant corrode again once the song cools?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias’s proprioceptive lens: veins prickle, knees soften, palms vibrate. Syntax flexes with acoustic pressure—short clauses when chimes multiply, longer breath units during the humming repair. No head-hops; Mayor’s interior is only surface-readable through lantern tremble. The lyric register (“tinkersong wonder,” “stone dropped into ink”) is consistent, taught early, and paid off when song becomes literal light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often handles spatial, tactile, and metaphoric work (“Rust crept… like petals around a wounded seed”). Rhythm modulates from percussive droplet-sentences to the held-breath clause that releases dawn. One minor paraphrase loop on “rust… rust” costs −0.2; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final line crystallizes without exposition: “the city loosen the breath it had forgotten holding.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fusing music-box repair, alchemical shard, and sentient rust into a sonic covenant feels freshly specific and inevitable in hindsight. The “mend what isn’t torn” concept flips mechanical repair into emotional resonance, resisting standard clockwork tropes. Risk is taken—quiet victory via breath and vibration—yet causality stays legible. Slight deduction for lantern-as-stolen-light image, a faint echo of fantasy cliché, but the acoustic solution redeems it.</comment>
