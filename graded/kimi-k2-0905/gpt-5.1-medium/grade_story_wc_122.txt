<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eira’s interior contradiction—teaching hearing children while deaf—grounds every beat; her embodied memories of “pounding desks” reveal genuine struggle. Micro-choice to thread the filament is visible, forecloses her old pedagogy, and costs her control. Student Jorin’s stuttered laugh-sob is the earned change; Eira’s own tears remain off-page, so renunciation cost is felt but not scaled to her skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the needleless phonograph rewrites silence into music felt in bone, undeniable social cost for the children. Accumulative lens holds—each drum’s sigh layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Eira stood among the drums”). Only micro-slippage: “backward recorded songs” logic is asserted not demonstrated, a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern is not backdrop but instrument: drilled tunnels and filament paths constrain how silence can be routed, charging the final image. Micro-setting (drum-skin pressed to cheek) literally channels the climax. Audibly muted light shafts are revisited in the mirrored hush of the ending, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as children move from mouth of cave to drum circumference.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defeat emotional numbness”—is signaled early and tightened when Jorin’s sob proves the first crack. Escalation is accumulative: each silent pulse through stone ups the ante until laughter-tears spill. Visible price is legible in Jorin’s wrist tremor that drum rhythm matches. No second reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence into felt music, never sermonized. The broken needle’s inability to touch vinyl becomes a resonant metaphor for deafness that still transmits. Final image of “ice in spring” reweights earlier “stone in chest” without moralizing. Slight over-articulation of “storm that never breaks” is the only echo toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Eira’s deaf perception—notice how “audibly muted light” is an oxymoron only she could coin. Sentence rhythm mimics drum cadence in places (“skins stretched taut over hollowed trunks”). No head-hopping; even Marlo’s signed dialogue is rendered as gesture-description, preserving distance. Compression like “weight that pressed against her bones” teaches the haptic pattern early and pays off at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy clauses to clipped drum fragments. Information density high: one sentence carries skin, trunk, heart metaphor without clogging. No synonym loops; “drums” repeats but each time with new modifier (“sleeping heart,” “rocked,” “sighed”). Mixed metaphor risk in “filament of hush” is justified by its material use. Minor scaffold: “like some wounded beetle” could trim, but it occurs early, not near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf teacher using silence-as-instrument—is fresh, not a trope remix. Filament-through-stone mechanic is specific enough to feel patentable. Transformation test: story collapses if Eira can hear. Risk in backward-record concept is fully committed to and paid off tactilely. Emotional truth of numbness cracked by sub-audible vibration feels newly observed.</comment>
