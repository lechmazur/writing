<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The claustrophobic child’s fear of underground spaces is vividly embodied (“unable to stand being underground for more than minutes”), and the inversion-hour trauma catalyzes a credible, lifelong quest to catalogue silences. Micro-choices—climbing, clipping in, pressing the doll to beams—reveal a hierarchy of values (silence over safety) with visible cost (falling doll, shared free-fall). The father’s single ascent is persuasively motivated by paternal worry and curiosity, and his unclenching shoulders enact a believable shift. The ending renunciation of mutual fear is earned, yet the interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“an intangibly tangible awareness”) that blurs moment-to-moment contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final shared weightlessness re-channels the bunker-builder’s lifetime of defensive concrete into a mutual vocabulary of silences, with the cost legible in the father’s unbolted shoulders and the child’s relinquished doll. Causality holds: inversion hour → doll lost → silence shared → stance crystallized. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“xenial trellis above the clouds”) and time marks arrive with each inversion alarm. The piece follows a single-scene arc compressed into two gravity-flip shards, taught early and paid off in the final image, satisfying Track B mosaic criteria.</comment>

<comment>The trellis itself—rusted beams, glass ribs, wind resonance—functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every action (balance, clipping, doll resonance test). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a child notices crossbars as “hands held out,” tastes metallic silence, fears sky-as-ceiling inversion. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies track across beams, distances hold, weather (storm bruise) tightens the final inversion. The porcelain doll evolves from relic to resonance chamber to sacrificed object, charging the final image when it drifts away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collecting versus being crushed by silence—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightens when the father stays for inversion, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior but decisive: the child chooses to “let it in,” a renunciation that risks suffocation for shared vocabulary. Cost is visible: the doll is lost, the father’s helmet dangles unused, both hang “unbound from the math of fear.” Escalation is situational but coherent; each inversion intensifies the stakes of silence without external antagonist, culminating in a credible stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: bunkers built to exclude silence, not just bombs, reverse-engineered into an aerial silence sanctuary. Subtext lives in gesture—porcelain arms wide in zero-g—and in the father’s unclenched shoulders, not exposition. The ending image of shared weightlessness offers a non-literal answer: risk exposure to the very hush you feared. No late articulation of thesis; insight is earned through sensory particulars, though the word “vocabulary” edges toward thematic echo, slightly thinning the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinctively lyric-perceptual: “air had its own gravity, a stretching contracted tone” is a perceptual signature that recurs. Syntax modulates from breathless inversion clauses to spare final line, mirroring emotional cadence. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“What are you doing, sprout?”) and carries subtext of parental incomprehension. Porcelain doll filter and silence tasting are consistent idiom; no head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses during float, staccato beats at re-entry. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, world data without scaffolding. Figurative runs are purposeful and patterned early (“gilded hush,” “orchard of unsounded thoughts”), not overwriting. One paraphrase loop (“silence…hush…quiet”) is minor, not touching closure. Copy is clean; no simultaneity errors, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses bunker survivalism with lyrical silence taxonomy—fresh synthesis. Inversion-hour gravity flip is taught early, becomes inevitable metaphor for reversing fear. Porcelain dol resonance and aerial silence farm feel particular to this world, not checklist quirky. Risk is high: lyric density could have collapsed into vagueness, yet specifics anchor every float. Final image of father-child doll triangulation reweights prior bunker logic without gimmickry.</comment>
