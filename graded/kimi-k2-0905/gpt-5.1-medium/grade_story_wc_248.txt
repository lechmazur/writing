<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“volcanic tenderness” and the rib-cage “doors” moment embody remorse—but the contradiction between arsonist and tender archivist is asserted, not dramatized in-scene; no micro-choice under fresh pressure tests the change, so the arc is more confessional than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the recovered promise reweights every defaced object with “ferocious care,” cost legible in the suspended tapestry image; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds; orientation anchors by line 5 and the rockslide gateway is clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—soot air, bronze hooks, lantern-lit fresco—guides movement and charges the final tapestry image; spatial choreography stays coherent through tunnels and well-shaft; the archive itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the climb-and-read tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is early and personal; pressure deepens via accumulating mutilations that tighten interpretive options; the final shift from erasure to curation narrows future paths with visible cost (vow to stay, add to trail).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from object wounds turned script: memory survives only if violence is transmuted into artifact; no explicit moral statement; final image re-codes prior arson as incomplete act, inviting reader to reweigh silence vs. stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice maintains perceptual signature—patterns as bodily memory, fire language—without register drift; compression (“three bronze hooks like a patient heart”) is pattern-taught and paid off; no head-hopping, stable psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is selective (“river of fire,” “crimes...layer of ash”) and never clouds causality; rhythm flexes with long breathless sentences and clipped fragments under lantern light; closure line is lean without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arson as failed curation inverted into archive vandalism-as-annotation; tapestry fragment re-weights fire from destroyer to illustrator; risk in quiet ending justified by charged poise rather than spectacle; concept fully committed without retreat.</comment>
