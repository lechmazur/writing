<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glazier’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the contradiction between his reverence for light and the council’s cost calculus is embodied in every beat. His choice to ask for “one more day” crystallizes a hierarchy of values (craft over capital) with visible social cost. The only minor slack: Kade remains a functional foil rather than a crucible, so status dynamics don’t tighten further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the request for one more dawn reframes the entire atrium as the town’s “reflection problem,” foreclosing demolition without preaching. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added shard of memory tightens the stakes until the final image of light “walking” the glass reweights everything. Cost is unmistakable: the glazier stakes his professional credibility on a poetics the council may ignore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass canopy itself functions as micro-setting: its fractured mullion mirrors the shoreline geography, literally steering the glazier’s reading of the town. Mist, salt, and refracted color constrain movement and visibility, forcing the climactic stance on the ladder. Final image—the calm quarry vs. the wind-whipped bay—charges the closing verdict with environmental irony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the atrium or lose the harbor’s refracted memory—tightens once: from estimate request to renunciation of “numbers.” The glazier’s agency is renunciatory rather than combative, but the cost (social credibility, possible job loss) is legible. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into 9+ territory; as is, one clean turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass-as-memory: value resides not in utility but in the slowness of light. The final image of “what the water and the glass agreed upon” reweights the entire concept of progress without moralizing. Noctilucent reckonings and rainbow seams accumulate into a quiet anti-capitalist parable that resists tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is inseparable from craft: light “explains what people could not say,” glass is “sand convinced to stand still.” Syntax grows longer and more liquid under the fog, then tightens into the clipped request for one more day. No head-hopping; Kade’s laugh is filtered through the glazier’s metaphor-rich bias, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the mist—long anaphoric clauses that slow time, then a terse final demand. Metaphors are precise (fracture lines = shoreline) and never stall propulsion. Minor scaffold: “the way…” repeats twice in adjacent sentences; barely touches the closure, so only a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a glazier who reads harbors like glass fractures, using quarry ripples as augury. The atrium-as-prismatic-archive feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in the final crystallized stance without gimmickry.</comment>
