<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—his decision to “let the stories soak into him” instead of writing them down is a micro-choice that costs him any hope of recovering his own name. Flaws (passivity, voyeurism, complicity in erasure) compound across beats and crystallize in the Earned Stasis of the blank death certificate. The contradiction between needing memories and refusing fixed identity plays out in tactile gestures: clutching a rusted ladder, tracing poison letters until they blur. No stock phrasing, no therapeutic self-labeling; every thought is filtered through diesel, salt, and steel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is the pencil-written certificate on the back of the poison label—an on-page Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of remaining unfinished legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first “paperwork washed… like rainwater” to the final “port shuffled and sighed,” each sensory layer tightening the stake in erasure. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation is taught by line 3 (“he walked out… anyway”) and pays off when the same bureaucratic void becomes his chosen freedom. Persistent constraint—bureaucracy’s ability to delete lives—shapes every tactic (listening, refusing ink, rewriting death).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop; its acoustic fold and metallic aftertaste physically force his decision to archive orally rather than in writing. The poison label’s cracked glass case and vanished ship embed the world-rule that paperwork can delete reality. Micro-setting—his narrow rented room above customs—places him inside the administrative machinery he flees. Weather (fog smudging cranes) and tide breath synchronize with his refusal to fix identity, charging the final blank line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remaining unfinished in a system that demands fixed identity—tightens when the overhead container speaks his paper name, a sonic hail that forecloses the option of total anonymity. The cost is visceral: he clings to rust, tasting blood, then chooses permanent provisionality. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds weight until the only release is to embrace the blank. No coincidence resolves; the crane drops the container, the voice stops, and the port keeps breathing—pressure sustained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the central contradiction: archives kill, so the only antidote is an unfinished archive. The poison label reappears as both emblem and canvas, repricing the concept of evidence. Subtext operates in gesture—pinning the label above the bed is a quiet vow to stay poisonous to fixed narrative. Final image of the blank line offers a non-literal answer: identity as spacious as low-tide harbor, refusing moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, salt-licked, diesel-breathing; perceptual signature distinct in every clause (“sound traveled strangely, folding and echoing”). Syntax mirrors the port’s lurch and swell—long clause, comma splice, fragment—without ever losing clarity. No head-hopping; single POV stays lashed to the body that tastes blood and feels rope. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; even conceptual moments stay maritime and manual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are lean and physical—“containers… frozen waves,” “tide inhaled dark water”—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can layer time, sensory skew, and world-rule (“a missing line of numbers in a database”). Final line cadence slows to match the deliberate surrender to blankness, ear-tested aloud for tidal rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic undeath angle feels fresh, but the deeper ingenuity is making erasure itself the protagonist’ s chosen medium. Poison label reused as writable death certificate fuses object and act into one irreplaceable mechanism. Risk—refusing conventional memory recovery—heightens thematic coherence without obscuring clarity. Synthesis of maritime logistics and metaphysics of identity is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
