<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist’s curiosity and reluctant commitment are sketched economically, but his interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. unexpected lightness after the boy’s visit—remains asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices are limited to listening, labeling, and sketching; no higher-stakes decision or visible cost is forced under the lavender pressure, so the “earned change” feels faint. The boy’s grief is conveyed through gesture and photograph, but the archivist’s own emotional risk never compounds, keeping characterization competent yet not piercing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s fragments constellate and the archivist feels “lighter,” a conceptual cost that reweights his role. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photo/object adds density until the final communal puzzle crystallizes. Causality is loose but coherent under this lyric design; however, the cost is more reported (“I shocked myself by feeling lighter”) than viscerally shown, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lavender rows and rusted factory are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the scent, heat, and bee-hum filter through the archivist’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography is clean—card table, chairs, bolt, lunchbox all tracked without drift. Environment does not yet constrain a final tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the micro-setting (photo edges “like dried petals”) participates in the closure image, satisfying the 8.8 ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archivist must host communal grief without being swallowed—arrives early and tightens once when the table fills with artifacts. Yet pressure plateaus: no single beat forces him to risk professional distance or personal emotion; the “lighter” epiphany is gifted rather than paid for. Escalation accumulates texture, not option-loss, fitting the lyric mode but limiting cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting pain into collective meaning emerges organically via photo constellations and lavender air, never sermonized. The final image of “constellations where before there had been only separate bruises” offers a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in mismatched teacups and fox-knitting woman enriches without overt statement; slight softness comes from the archivist’s insight being self-declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise, archivist-perceptual signature: “subtle puzzle archivist,” “curled at the edges like dried petals,” “machines creaked…like restless whales.” Syntax modulates from longer reflective sentences to shorter, breath-filled observations under lavender breeze. Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Myra’s fox-knitting calm vs. boy’s washer-heavy grief—without voice convergence. No head-hopping; perceptual limits respected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrically taut: information-dense lines (“numbered in a careful, almost apologetic hand”) do double duty. Metaphors are fresh and consistent—lavender as archive, machines as whales—never crowding a single beat. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as if” clauses in early factory description (−0.2). Final third is clean; rhythm accelerates naturally toward closure image, earning high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Combining industrial ruins, lavender aromatherapy, and participatory photo-archive is a fresh synthesis; the grief-archive hosted outdoors among flowers feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet accumulative structure, but coherence holds. Specifics—dove gray map case, apologetic numbering, fox-knitting woman—anchor originality beyond concept, preventing gimmickry. Emotional specificity carries more weight than surface novelty, achieved here.</comment>
