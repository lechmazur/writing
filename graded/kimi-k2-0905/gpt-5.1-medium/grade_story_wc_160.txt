<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is present but leans on abstract moral accounting (“encrypted compassion”) rather than embodied contradiction; the tremble is visible yet not tied to a specific micro-choice that costs him on the page. Councilors remain types whose speech is filtered through Arlen’s summary, so status pressure stays theoretical. The arc lands as a credible renunciation, but the emotional price is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the chain-circle reconfiguration is on-page and carries conceptual cost—the city accepts rotating vulnerability. Causality is Accumulative: chain → proposal → stepped acceptance; no single reversal, but density tightens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The invitation-via-saliva trick is elided until late, but the pattern is taught in time to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The volcano-as-amphitheater is more than backdrop: its breathing acoustics mirror the city’s cyclic floods, and the cracked stone literally shapes where Arlen lays the chain. Dust motes and loosening pebbles are tactile, underfoot, and tied to the moment of decision. The surveyor’s chain itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the geometry of mercy; without it, the final circle could not form.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rotating survival—arrives late but is foreshadowed by downstream floodgates; escalation is the accretive layering of incompatible demands until Arlen’s rotating-gate scheme becomes the only shared loss. Tightening is visible when each councilor physically bends the chain. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: perpetual uncertainty replaces permanent victory; the price is legible but not felt in the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges as “justice is a schedule, not a shrine.” The encrypted-compassion motif stays implicit: the chain’s iron impartiality rewrites the city’s moral code without manifesto. No moralizing final sentence; the circle of chain re-weights earlier treaties into a living calendar. Ambiguity lingers—every district will someday drown—yet the image is cleanly resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Arlen’s perceptual filter: river-engineer metaphors, valve imagery, acoustics of stone. Syntax flexes under pressure—“the building breathes” repeated like piston strokes—yet never breaks pattern. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; council voices are rendered as colliding abstractions, true to Arlen’s overwhelmed ear. Diction remains within the plausible lexicon of a machinist-poet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the volcano metaphor; sentence length modulates from short cracks to looping chain-lines. One paraphrase loop—“the building breathes” twice in 30 words—drops a hair-line 0.2. No mixed metaphors; “encrypted compassion” is the single abstract ridge yet is anchored to the chain’s iron. Information density is high: every sentence maps, measures, or voices conflict.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floodgate machinist as civic mediator is fresh; the rotating-mercy mechanism reframes disaster as time-share justice. Volcano-amphitheater storing treaties in stone niches is a crisp world-specific invention. The adhesive forensics moment risks gimmick but is saved by its saliva-as-census image. Overall synthesis feels particular, not prompt-chopped, though the council quarrels skate close to familiar allegory.</comment>
