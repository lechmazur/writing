<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eli’s interior contradiction—repairing carousels while keeping his own heart stopped—is dramatized through the tactile act of singing life into the horses; the final “quiet click” of fear slipping out rewards the prior causality. Micro-choices (touching the cage, starting to sing) visibly re-weight his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: he forfeits his protective silence. One slip: “words failed whenever he tried to speak” veers toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—cadence shift from dust-mute to singing-spin charges the stake. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the halted carousel turns, halo dims to watchful glow, wind bells become doorway not countdown—all on-page with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 10; no causality breaks. Minor −0.3: the “wrong turn” mechanic is asserted rather than spatially prepared, but it merely admits him to the oasis, not a causal pivot, so caps nothing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paint-flake lions, sunken wheels, breathing halo—selective, POV-filtered details scaffold the emotional arc without catalog bloat. The half-assembled horses function as micro-setting that literally constrains choice: only their unfinished state allows Eli’s song to re-start motion. Halo reprises inside the final image, charging closure. One hairline slip: “time folded inward” edges toward abstract metaphor, but dust motes immediately ground it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—silence vs. possibility—tightens when Eli’s voice becomes the motor replacing fallen gears; the tightening is single, sufficient, legible. Cost extracted: lifelong muteness traded for public song; halo dims as if paying the price. No reversal, yet accretive pressure (dust → listening → spin) satisfies accumulative lens. Agency remains internal, renunciatory, credible at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete mechanics: silence literally powers the carousel once transmuted into song. Halo and wind bells re-weight from menace to invitation without authorial comment. Final image of “smallest circle of silence” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question—no moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the miracle real or collaborative hallucination? Complexity embraced.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited stays inside Eli’s perceptual signature—dust as held breath, song made of long pauses. Pattern-taught elision (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) recurs and is paid off when the hush becomes the door he finally pushes. Syntax mirrors emotional tempo: breath-long clauses during slow spin, fragmentary half-sentences at the brightening climax. No head-hop; no register drift; no dialogue to distort voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from hush-bound monosyllables to galloping anaphora as platform accelerates; paragraph cuts track visual beats. Figurative density kept selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler scaffolding. One loop risk: “quietly persistent” appears twice; second use earns slight redundancy (−0.2). Otherwise high information density; every line advances image, emotion, or motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Abandoned-circus-train trope is refreshed by treating it as a stalled carousel workshop whose unfinished horses can be re-booted only by song. Halo fragment re-imagined not as power source but as responsive listener. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: carpenter who fixes motionless machines must animate them with vocal breath. Risk—the lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Slight proximity to “miracle” cliché offset by grounded mechanical detail.</comment>
