<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and conflicted—she both fears and needs the gorge’s music—yet the “modestly fearless” tag is asserted twice rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The crocodile-tooth ritual is a vivid, character-specific gesture that fuses memory and present action, earning her final laugh. No secondary character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is a credible renunciation of pure grief in favor of hybrid laughter, cost felt when the wind “tilts” at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s music modulates from wail to giggle, re-weighting the living/dead contract. Causal chain holds—each confession is elicited by Mara’s teasing invitation, tightening strings toward harmony. Cost is legible in the final image: sunrise fully enters the gorge, innocence returned to children, but Mara’s private ache (tooth bite, crown of wind) persists. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo gorge is not postcard scenery; its cliff-harp is a tool that literally re-tunes choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s ear—wind temperature, wire-scrape laughter—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: pebbles knocked downhill track her descent; sunrise angle shifts mark beat changes. Micro-setting (tooth, harp) constrains tactics and recharges the final image—sunrise now “gently veiled” by the laughter she released.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore children’s laughter by re-balancing spectral music—signaled in paragraph 7. One meaningful tightening: each spectral confession replaces dirge with joke, tightening harp strings toward harmony; protagonist agency drives every offer. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—Mara trades her mythic solemnity for a bruised, rough harmony, foreclosing her prior lone-ferry identity. No coincidence; all escalation is because/therefore under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: grief fermented into saving humor. Subtext lives in the harp’s “bruised harmonies”—a literalization of how comedy and sorrow share one reed. Final image reweights premise: laughter is not cure but stitches, visible mending. No moralizing; the joke is the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Mara’s shoulder, diction river-polished and wind-scraped. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for gorge hush, staccato confessions for comic spill. Perceptual signature is bias toward sound over sight; metaphors are acoustic (“laughter caught in a rusted wire fence”). No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression & elision are taught early (“first light never reached…”) and paid off in final veiled sunrise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High figurative density is patterned and necessary—every metaphor is sonic, sustaining the acoustic metaphor system. No synonym churn; “wind-arranged hair into a simple crown” is irreplaceable. One paraphrase loop: “the dead tried to speak… spectral confessions rose” within two sentences, minor. Final beat reads aloud without drumbeat; sentence openings vary, momentum breathes with descent turns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—haunted harp that must be retuned by stand-up therapy for ghosts—is fresh, yet grows inevitable from Mara’s backstory promise. Transformation test: swap gorge for any landscape and the sonic mechanics collapse; the harp’s misaligned strings are non-portable. Risk in treating laughter as literal material force pays off; no retreat into metaphor. Specificity of dentures-puppet and river-monster hoax keeps whimsy grounded in lived folly.</comment>
