<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s calm, ritualized competence is tactile—tongue to stone, fingertip on basalt, marrow ring—but we never glimpse contradictory impulse; the mission feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. Because no alternative path is ever risked, the final “bloom of hush” registers as elegant execution, not costly renunciation—earned stasis without visible forfeiture. Interior voice is evocative yet single-note; the absence of micro-choice undercuts the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the conjured hush cups the storm-sound, a Charged Poise that reweights the premise—lightning must learn rest. Causal chain holds: fracture-reading → gap finding → stone activation → bloom; each step narrows options toward irrevocable quiet. Cost is conceptual yet legible—the mapkeeper internalizes the storm’s volume and cancels it with his own stillness—so lens and price survive the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as instrument and antagonist: ice curtain, glowing spore spiral, and slow spiral floor all constrain footing, breath, acoustics—environment literally shapes tactic. Echo chamber stone operates as portable setting-microcosm, its pulses and fractures guiding every ingress beat; without it, spatial navigation collapses. Setting detail is selective, sensory, and causally active—exactly the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet”—is signaled early and sharpened by the storm’s voiced invasion; tension escalates as energy beings’ laughter ricochets deeper into the cave, compressing stillness into an ever-smaller radius. The mapkeeper’s agency is ritual, not reversible: each scrape, taste, and exhalation removes retreat until the final bloom forecloses all noise. Cost is diffuse—his body becomes the anvil—but still visible; misses 8.8 only because the price feels atmospheric rather than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from reversal: silence is not absence but active forging—“heavier than noise.” The bloom’s petal of emptiness reconfigures value without moralizing; reader left to weigh whether teaching lightning to rest justifies erasing its voice. Subtext resonates through image rather than assertion, avoiding final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a mineral, tidal cadence—long sentences that layer clauses like sediment, then fracture into short imperative beats under ice-contact. Perceptual signature is precise: the mapkeeper reads space by resonance and flavor, never by color cliché. Diction stays within plausible archaic technician lexicon; no head-hop or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned early—“hammered repose,” “anvil of everything”—so lyric excess reads intentional rather than accidental overwrite. One scaffold tic: repeated “slow spiral” (three hits) could compress to two. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no mixed vehicles; closure line is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geomantic cartographer + acoustic speleology + post-alien storm era feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted. Inversion of trope—storm as communicative beings, silence as hostile act—carries conceptual risk that pays off in final image. Specificity of fracture grammar and marrow resonance lifts premise above eco-fantasy template.</comment>
