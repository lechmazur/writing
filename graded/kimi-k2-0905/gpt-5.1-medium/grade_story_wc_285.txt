<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—needing to absorb others’ secrets yet remain porous—stays embodied in the tactile yarn-needle ritual and the moment he “held them all together.” Micro-choice (waiting three breaths, tracing circles) externalizes the palimpsest promise. Cost is visible: each crossing etches residue, and the final “shared, spindrift serenity” is paid for by his accumulated burden. Missing ≥9.0 because we never see a clear mistake or limit breached; his competence feels absolute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horses step forward into fog, the mother’s plea—”Let him not be afraid to leave me”—reconfigures every prior vow of keeping. The yarn needle and ambient listening are persistent constraints shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the final image: coach and script dissolve into a blank page the night must learn to read. Causal chain holds: because he listens, therefore he can ferry, therefore meaning thins to serenity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing is not backdrop but pressure engine: it muffles sound, forces the coachman to navigate by feel, and makes the far shore a literal blank page. Yarn needle operates as micro-setting that constrains his only coping act. Spatial choreography is immaculate—hooves find ruts “by feel alone.” Environment charges the final image: blank page = unseen bank.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the coachman distill complexity without being overwhelmed—tightens when the boy’s illness is revealed, forcing the mother’s plea to overwrite prior vows. One meaningful turn: coachman’s interior shift from passive listening to active “holding together” of conflicting promises. Cost is felt in the serene but weightless final image; no external price is visibly forfeited, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges irreducibly from the ferrying act itself: words don’t vanish, they layer. Final image reweights the premise—meaning is not carried off but left blank for the night to write. No moral is stated; resonance is purely imagistic. The palimpsest promise is lived, not lectured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly calibrated to the coachman’s perceptual filter: “the way fog feels the shape of everything it touches.” Syntax elongates or contracts with his breathing pace; “spindrift serenity” is an idiom only he could coin. No head-hopping; even the mother’s plea arrives as skin-level whisper. Voice is inseparable from metaphysics of listening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Metaphors (lanternlight halos, dark knuckles, blank page) stay internally consistent and physically grounded. Rhythmic variation mirrors hoof-fall and heartbeat. No overwriting even at peak beat—the serenity line is single, unadorned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ferryman-psychopomp trope is transmuted into literary midwife of meaning itself; the yarn needle darning silences is utterly specific. Accumulative lyric structure (each crossing writes over the last) feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk: quiet ending without overt rupture, but coherence justifies it. Could edge higher if one prior passenger had returned to haunt him.</comment>
