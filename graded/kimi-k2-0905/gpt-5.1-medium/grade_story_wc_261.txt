<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to close wounds yet compulsively reopening them—drives every beat; the graft failure and plant-telepathy force her to confront that contradiction in embodied, painful ways. Emotion is never labeled; it arrives as the itch of the shaved scalp, the laugh that hurts, the fingers drifting to the scar. The final renunciation—"some closures bloom only when you stop trying to seal them"—is earned by the prior cascade of micro-choices that bruise her further. Only the mentor’s "displaced miracle" line feels slightly diagnostic, keeping this just shy of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A Hybrid lens (lyric-Accumulative dominant at the end) is taught by the second paragraph and holds cleanly: each vegetal whisper thickens the pattern until the coffee-ring epiphany reweights the stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s mandate shifts from sealing scars to reading them—paid for by the visible neural cost (bandage, frozen sand, ivy’s invasive voice). The one minor slack is orientation: "quiet tower" geography stays functional but never constrains choice; the ivy could murmur anywhere. Still, the ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower’s stone, dawn light, and sweating coffee cup function as micro-setting: the ring’s spreading halo becomes the lens through which future scars are glimpsed, directly shaping Mara’s final stance. Sensory detail is biased to her surgical body—antiseptic starch, rain-trapped cloth—so environment and anatomy merge. Spatial choreography is minimal (single bed, tray, window) but coherent. The hourglass’s frozen grains act as both tool and time-object, constraining perception; without it the epiphany would lose its projector-beam literalness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with unclosable wounds—tightens once: the graft’s failure flips Mara’s tool from scalpel to telescope, forcing her to abandon the sealing paradigm. Cost is legible in the bandage, the invasive vegetal voices, and the final meteor-hush that confirms her indefinite vigil. Agency is interior (a renunciation of method) but forecloses the previous path with felt price. Under the Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than reverses; a single meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accruing vegetal testimony: scars are not errors to excise but illuminated histories to witness. No character articulates a thesis; insight arrives as the coffee-ring galaxy of wounds orbiting Mara’s new mandate. The displaced-miracle motif reweights from mentor’s breakdown to Mara’s salvaged vocation, resonating without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—she will still cause pain by reading—but the ending refuses false comfort, letting complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a surgical, lyric precision: "every small leaf a mouthful of rustling consonants." Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments when ivy first speaks, then longer clauses as she assimilates. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is relentlessly Mara’s. The diction ("starburst burn," "projector beam") stays within a brain-trauma researcher’s lexicon without showing off. Rhythm modulates from hush to gossip-rustle to meteor quiet, mirroring her acceptance.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry double duty: "The coffee ring has spread, a misshapen circle like a crater seen from orbit" simultaneously advances setting, theme, and stakes. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (ivy whisper) and paid off in the final image; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated ("I glimpse"). Opening and closing lines are visceral hooks that re-charge each other.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Plant-telepathy as fresh spin on trauma tourism: the vegetal witnesses invert the human interviewer, forcing the seeker to become reader rather than surgeon. The coffee-ring scrying glass and frozen hourglass literalize time-lapse wounds without feeling gimmicky. Mentor’s "displaced miracle" phrase refracts twice, each time with heavier cost. Risk—lyric interiority, single setting, no antagonist—heightens rather than dilutes stakes. Specificity of rosemary’s Sunday-roast memory makes the concept irreproducibly this story.</comment>
