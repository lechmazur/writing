<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Father Jonas’s quiet, music-as-exorcism vocation is vivid; his interiority—“I am not here to drag you out, but to ask why you walked in”—shows a hierarchy of values that costs him authority. The girl remains a prop, never granted a micro-choice or contradiction, so the relational crucible is one-sided. Still, his embodied micro-gesture—ultramarine on both brows—earns the earned stasis that ends the possession. Flaw: secondary character is pure vessel, flattening status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lattice tightens: loop pedal → captured demonic laugh → mirrored contradiction → slip. Orientation is nailed by word 50 (abandoned chapel, dusk). Closure is a Charged Poise: the demon “slipped free,” leaving Jonas in blue-lined stillness that forecloses choir-and-candle exorcism forever. Cost is the chapel’s dimensional anchor contracting around his private ritual—visible constraint in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the single square of ultramarine functions as both tool and environment—its “strange attention” constrains the exorcism to one hue, one question. Dust-softened stained glass is not mere mood; it literally muffles sound, letting the loop lattice breathe. Spatial choreography is clean—guitar case, palette, pew, pedal—every object handled on-page and re-weighted at exit. Gate met: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time before possession completes—tightens once: Jonas must argue meaning into changing direction before the knitting finishes. Agency is rhetorical: each anaphora (“You claim…you also claim…”) narrows the demon’s options until contradiction ejects it. Cost is the chapel’s listening walls contracting, a visible price that alters future rituals. No secondary escalation, but one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: possession as inverted emptiness—‘empty’ means ‘full of unnameables’. Ultramarine returns charged, reweighting ‘single hue’ from limitation to mirror. Final image of blue-lined brows offers non-literal answer: identity is seam, not surface. Avoids moralizing; the demon’s laugh looped into ghost percussion is the thesis made sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: “dust softened the stained glass light into a muffled clarity” is priest-like, sonic, theological. Syntax breathes with pedal loops—long sentences stretch, then contract at demon slip. No head-hopping; interior access stays Jonas-locked. Diction stays within ecclesiastical musician lexicon—latched, lattice, countermelody—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mimics loop pedal—repetition of “loop,” “lattice,” “claim” teaches pattern, then pays off when demon snags on mirrored claim. No mixed metaphors; ultramarine line is clean physical act. One paraphrase loop: “empty…full of things we do not want to name” could compress, but it occurs mid-homiletic beat where expansion is tactical. Final line “slipped free” is crisp, propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: exorcism as lo-fi gig, demon as audio sample to be out-argued. Ultramarine pigment older than chapel foundation turns color into temporal anchor—concrete specificity that feels inevitable. Risk—ritual without incense, only silence and chord—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity: music-as-theology premise followed to logical end, demon defeated by rhetorical drop-out.</comment>
