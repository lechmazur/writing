<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kenji’s interiority is sharp and specific—his “desperately jocular” smile is shown through the hospital-corridor simile and his cautious sit on the bench. The contradictory impulse to cure loneliness while fearing chain-break is dramatized in the moon-rock hand-off, not summarized. His micro-choice to stay and listen until the loneliness shifts from singular to shared is earned and costs him the safe anonymity he arrived with. Mara’s elusiveness is functional rather than fully rounded, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kenji’s loneliness is re-priced from private pathology to shared cargo under the reciprocity rule. The final image—“heavier with every truth, until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared”—is on-page and carries conceptual cost (he can never return to the old solitude). Causal lens holds: each confession is a because/therefore step that narrows his exit until he endures the new communal weight. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and continuously reinforced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled platform, fern-invaded tile, and moon-rock that makes ivy “tremble as if it heard a far train” are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Kenji’s awe. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara steps over a fern, benches are sanded smooth by waiting, bodies circle the crude concrete map. The station constrains the experiment—no one can leave until reciprocity is satisfied—so environment shapes tactics. Final image reuses the station’s broken-river map as the stage where meaning is reconfigured, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—Kenji’s fear that curing his loneliness will break the chain—is signaled early and tightened when each confession adds weight he cannot shed. Escalation is causal: every new truth narrows his option to retreat until endurance becomes the only agency left. Cost is visible in the final image of shared weight; no convenient escape is offered. Slight deduction because pressure is accumulative rather than a single decisive turn, keeping it just below 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loneliness as gravity, not rash; reciprocity as art of not hoarding miracles. No meta-commentary—meaning accrues through moon-rock hand-offs and confessed secrets. Final image reweights “cure” to communal burden without moralizing. The moon rock’s return to circulation re-prices miracle as transient gift, resonant and unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Kenji’s perceptual lens; diction (“desperately jocular,” “harmless little desk”) is character-specific. Mara’s voice is distinctively clipped and paradoxical (“Tonight I am exactly this height”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under confessional pressure. Rhythm modulates from languid platform descriptions to staccato confession pile-on, mirroring Kenji’s rising weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high information density—each sentence advances premise, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined: “politely closed parentheses,” “stalled prayers”—each image serves theme without crowding. No loops or scaffold; only one near-paraphrase (“technically not supposed to know each other” vs “statistically improbable acquaintances”) but the second line re-inflects with anarchic humor, so forgiven. Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Exchange premise—post-disaster logistics as social art installation—is fresh and fully committed to. Moon rock as loneliness token circulated through five wars is specific, not quirky ornament. Risky tonal blend of bureaucratic satire and lyric grief pays off: “polite anarchy” is taught early and charged at closure. Transformation test fails—this exact alchemy of logistics, reciprocity, and moon rock could not survive renaming.</comment>
