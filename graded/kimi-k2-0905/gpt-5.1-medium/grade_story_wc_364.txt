<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Corren’s “meek” interiority is asserted but barely dramatized; his descent into the mine and final speech to the stone are the only beats where his determination collides with fear, so the contradiction is announced rather than lived. The emotional cost (curled shoulders, apologizing hammer strikes) is named repeatedly but never complicates his choices; the final ascent reads as triumph, not paid-for endurance. Because the awakening stories he collects remain off-stage, the furnace-of-hope metaphor feels second-hand and untested. Earned Stasis is gestured at, yet no path is foreclosed on the page; he simply leaves the mine carrying a new ladder, unchanged in station or psychology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stone becomes supple ladder, world re-configured—but the cost is conceptual rather than personal; Corren’s own stake never tightens. Causality is soft: the silk “shivers toward the dark,” yet the reader must accept that cloth remembers intact ladders without shown rules. The arches’ gravity logic is poetic, not procedural, so the final image feels earned atmospherically but not mechanically. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props, yet the missing bridge between “divining silk” and “stone obeys story” keeps the beat just shy of decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, glowing cobalt pears, and calcifying orchards are vivid, specific, and immediately filter through Corren’s smith-eye for texture; every sensory note is tethered to his craft (anvils as promises, mineral husks). The mine gallery collapse is spatially tracked; distances and body positions hold. The environment’s rule-set (stone floats up, gravity warps) is learned by touch, never narrated, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the pear-light refrains from altering his final choice; the setting dazzles but does not ultimately constrain the closure beat, capping Q3 at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“can anything still be made whole?”—is signaled early and tightened once when Corren confronts the fused heap underground. Yet the price is paid by the world, not the protagonist; the lattice rises, but Corren sacrifices no tool, story, or hope of his own. Escalation is atmospheric (arches groan, mine creaks) rather than tactical; options do not narrow, they transmute. Agency is present—he speaks, climbs, carries—but the cost remains abstract, keeping pressure legible but not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: resilience is not repair but re-imagining broken things into new shapes. The silk’s ghost-images and the stone-into-ladder transformation reprice “wholeness” as metamorphosis, not restoration. No character moralizes; the final image answers the opening question without pronouncement. The concept stays particular to this orchard planet; universality arises from specificity, not maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Corren’s perceptual filter: “anvils look less like tools and more like promises” is a smith’s metaphysics. Syntax lengthens and breathes during underground descent, mirroring cautious movement; paragraph rhythms vary. Diction is consistent with a quiet artisan—“bartered awakenings,” “cautious ghost,” “brittle prayers”—never drifts into academic gloss. No dialogue appears; narration carries subtext alone, successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are dense, multivalent: “the planet itself seemed to be forgetting how to be soft” compresses geologic and emotional stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—floating arches braid sky, stone tries to rise—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacks (“azure defiance,” “hollow stare between understanding and confusion”) flirt with purple but serve atmospheric escalation and do not recur in climax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing sentences anchor and echo cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating orchards calcifying into tools is fresh, yet the “planet awakening” trope is familiar; the innovation lies in the humble blacksmith collecting stories as currency. The silk-as-memory-divining-rod risks convenience, but its introduction as prior payment and its quiet obedience keep the rule from feeling retrofitted. Transformation test fails: swap pears for apples and planet for valley—emotional arc still functions, so specificity is strong but not absolute. Risk-taking is present—lyric causality, conceptual closure—yet the piece hedges by keeping Corren personally safe.</comment>
