<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina’s interiority is character-specific (the copyist’s ear for “wrong strokes” rings false) and her micro-choice to encode instructions in scores is embodied. The boy’s arrival tests her motive—she shifts from solitary transcriber to mentor-witness—but the cost (risk of discovery) is named, not felt. Flaw-competence balance is right: she trembles yet keeps writing. No internal contradiction is staged in-scene; the “hope” epiphany is label-only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the pirate signal clarifies, therefore Lina writes, therefore dust-memory becomes legible, therefore the boy arrives—each step narrows options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she stays, keeps writing, accepts the danger; cost is the now-visible shimmer on the boy—proof the tactic works and the gamble is real. Orientation anchors by line 3; no debt. One soft reset: “ash still drifted” after libraries burned reads as scenic stasis, not causal change, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove, radio glow, and coal-light function as micro-setting—objects that constrain choice (Lina trusts only the dial, writes by its green). Ash as both snow and archive is specific, not symbolic; it guides action (she writes on it, scatters it). Spatial choreography is sharp: boy slips from mist to coals, dust on boots tracked across floor. The “island of coal light” image charges the final tableau.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the memory insurgency alive—tightens once: the boy’s arrival makes the tactic visible, raising the chance of betrayal. Cost is conceptual (city could re-starve) but also tangible: the dust now clings to a witness who can’t be erased. Agency is Lina’s continuous writing; no outside rescue. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—story as subversive pollen—emerges via concrete recipe (charcoal + pollen + spit) rather than assertion. Final image of dust “nudging at his outline” reweights prior stanzas: the joke-markets and barge songs now have a body. No moral is stated; the silence after “listen with me” invites reader to hear the same frequency. Ambiguity is purposeful: is the boy courier or spy? Complexity holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is perceptual signature: every noun is filtered through auditory craft—“minor third,” “suspended chord,” “thistled calm.” Sentence rhythm mimics radio static: long clauses interrupted by stub vowels. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Diction never exceeds copyist’s lexicon. Final line cadence—“ready to catch whatever the next verse chose to save”—is aural, not explanatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: “ash still drifted… sifting down like gray snow onto her pages” does triple duty (setting, stakes, foreshadowing). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single, coherent. One mixed vehicle: “stubborn as cinders” clashes with earlier “gray snow,” but it’s local and doesn’t touch closure. Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses under threat, longer when copying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—“teach dust to tell stories” via encoded song—feels inevitable yet fresh. Combines post-catastrophe trope with musicology insurgency; dust as palimpsest is specific to this world. Transformation test passes: swap dust for seeds and the entire causal chain collapses. Risk in lyric elliptical structure is paid off by legible closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
