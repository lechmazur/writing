<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is hypnotically specific—“walls are at best polite suggestions,” “endless hallway”—and the contradiction between immortal fatigue and curiosity is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choices (loosening escondite anchors) flow from established motive. The final renunciation carries conceptual cost, yet the amulet’s push feels slightly external; still, the arc lands as earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spatial distortions tighten like a tourniquet around the immortal’s refusal to accept distance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—“I might finally learn how to say goodbye and mean…a direction”—with undeniable conceptual cost (immortality’s grip loosed). Each braid of light/geometry adds density without outline drift; no orientation debt; payoff image re-weights every earlier goodbye denied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is not backdrop but actor: walls tilt loyalty, corridors shorten agency, benches record centuries of inertia. Selective sensory hierarchy (color over sound, geometry over mass) mirrors immortal perception. The amulet shard as micro-setting literally tugs “nearby possibilities,” constraining final decision. Every descriptive stroke either tightens stakes or charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the immortal permit distance?—is signaled early and escalates via spatial mutiny: rooms curve, exits re-map, magnetic threads yank possibility. No external coincidence; pressure is geometry itself narrowing options. One meaningful tightening: fragment aligns storm and interior, forcing the immortal to redraw boundaries. Cost is conceptual (immortality’s foreclosure) but visible on-page; could use slightly more visceral sting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—endlessness vs. the elastic afterlife of absence—emerges through spatial metaphor rather than thesis. “Spaces once occupied by bodies did not go blank; they stretched…” reweights loss as topology, not theology. No moralizing; final line offers direction as answer, not lesson. Pattern of refracted light and hallway imagery returns charged with new emotional valence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly singular: cadence of millennium fatigue compressed into crystalline clauses (“I am tired of pages that never turn”). Perceptual signature—dimensionally aware POV measures distance in possibilities, not meters—never slips. Syntax modulates from languid嵌套短语 to snap-close monosyllables at mutiny crest. No dialogue, no head-hop; compression and elision are taught in first 25% and paid off in final re-orientation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-impeccable: each sentence advances image or stakes (“Even for a bored immortal, that was new”). Metaphors stay internally consistent—light as serpents, space as mutinous hull. Minor density spike mid-storm (“crowns of bent nails,” “frantic constellations”) but pattern-taught and purposeful. Zero loops, clean tense, paragraphs cuttable only at cost of resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of solar-storm physics with sentimental metaphysics feels fresh; spatial mutiny as emotional plot is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—turning geometry itself into antagonist—pays off without gimmickry. Specifics (prismatic escondite, resignation-from-reality sorcerer) prevent abstract drift. Final reconfiguration of goodbye as directional coordinate rather than void is a small, genre-defying revolution.</comment>
