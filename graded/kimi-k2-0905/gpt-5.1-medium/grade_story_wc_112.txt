<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ilen’s obliging trait is asserted, not dramatized; he never refuses but we see no prior cost. The “icy warmth” is repeated yet never embodied in a micro-choice that hurts. Interiority lapses into labels—“he felt heroic”—instead of contradictory impulse under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism hums and time is believed sideways, but the cost is conceptual, not personally felt by Ilen. Causal chain is thin—lever nudge → stabilized dreams—without intermediate obstacle or price to him. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ice-sheathed cliffs, twin-moon dusk, and frost-polished lever are vivid and selective, filtered through Ilen’s mechanic gaze. The aviaries and suspended embryos ground the speculative science without expo dump. Final image of prism-hum reuses the “icy warmth” motif to charge closure, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Single tightening: lever adjustment stabilizes dreams. Stakes are declared—“lose the valley’s future”—but never personalize Ilen; no resource or relationship of his is risked. Pressure is external to the embryos; protagonist agency operates without visible personal cost, capping escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of sideways time emerges from manifold images and embryo dreams, never moralized. Final “he had asked it to” grants quiet conceptual reweighting. Subtext would sharpen if Ilen’s family delay echoed in the sideways present; as is, linkage remains implicit but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Ilen with mechanic-specific diction—“coils of superconductor gleamed like coiled frost.” Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for valley hush, clipped fragments at console. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and purposeful under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, tool, and emotional filter. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and precise. Occasional elevated register—“temporal manifold”—is justified by Rae’s dialogue and does not leak into Ilen’s interior.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sky-mechanic tuning sideways time via holographic nexus feels fresh, synthesizing hard-SF and lyric SF modes. Embryos dreaming on alternate durational axes is specific to this piece. Risk is moderate; concept does not retreat, yet emotional arc could be more singular to avoid generic “lonely tech” echo.</comment>
