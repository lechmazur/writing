<comment>Ira’s interiority is consistently shadow-laced: his reflex to “let the accusation rest” and literal mirroring of others’ fears reveal a man trained to metabolize emotion into data. The orchard’s dream-force collides with that training, forcing him to abandon pure mediation and risk complicity—an arc legibly paid for when he lifts the fragment and feels “futures shiver across his skin.” The anomaly’s motives stay slightly abstract (her raw vow feels more manifesto than lived need), so the dyad’s crucible cools a notch short of 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lattice is tight: every mirror-glimpse narrows Ira’s viable choices until only co-authorship of a new accord remains. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—he re-constitutes the treaty in real time while holding the cracked futures, a visible conceptual cost that forecloses both colonial seizure and passive peacekeeper neutrality. Orientation is swift (lighthouse orchard by line 3) and the shattered-crystal motif teaches its own grammar early, satisfying mosaic drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s “bare-limbed trees,” swinging lanterns, and grinding ice act as environmental antagonists, physically creaking under Ira’s boots while optically feeding the mirror-shop. Micro-setting triumph: the broken crystal fragment becomes terrain—its glass skin determines how futures can be handled, stored, or re-framed, and it is literally in hand at the last beat, charging the finale. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the chosen images constrain tactical movement, so the 9-band gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates cleanly under Causal lens: each successive mirror forecast strips away Ira’s ability to delegate violence to off-stage Keepers, forcing an either/or between sanctioning slaughter or rewriting the treaty template. The decisive tightening occurs when he physically lifts the fragment and tests futures in front of the anomaly—this irrevocably commits him to authorship and exposes personal political risk (loss of Keeper backing). Stakes stay singular—“orchard as autonomous sanctuary”—with no diffusion; cost is visible in the fragment’s hairline cracks spreading under shared gaze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the accord itself is revealed as a cracked artifact whose supposed completeness is propaganda; legitimacy is re-priced by letting the “anomaly” co-write its terms. Subtext is embedded in gesture—Ira’s silence, the shadow’s lag, the mirrors’ mute chorus—so meaning accrues imagistically rather than didactically. Final image of fragment re-constituted under joint gaze offers a Charged Poise that reweights prior colonial treaties as broken glass rather than holy writ, satisfying 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens retains calm peacekeeper diction—measured cadence, forensic metaphors (“silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness”)—while letting perceptual warps (mirrors, futures) seep in, matching Ira’s training versus dream contamination. No head-hops; anomaly’s interior is inferred only through Ira’s mirroring discipline, maintaining clean psychic distance. Syntax modulates: longer syntactic chains during reflection, clipped fragments under crystal-flash pressure, showing conscious rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only minor filter verb (“he saw”) in high-heat moment but compensated by immediate embodied follow-through. Metaphors stay internally coherent (glass = treaty = futures) and physical logic never snaps. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, metaphor, and causality—yet momentum breathes. No artifacts in the closure third; final line crystallizes without figurative muddle, satisfying 9-band line craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “mystic shop of mirrors” trope and fuses it with geopolitical treaty drafting—an unexpected synthesis that feels inevitable once underway. The orchard-as-sanctuary refusing colonial scripting is fresh; using literal glass shards to renegotiate legal instruments literalizes the metaphor without kitsch. Specific risk: letting the antagonist (anomaly) co-author the accords—avoids both savior and villain binaries, landing a genuinely nuanced moral calculus.</comment>
