<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—once mapping emotion through scent, now through listening—pulls every beat; the micro-choice to let the client “remain an outline” externalizes her new instrument of perception. The screw’s installation is a visible, costly micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values: she forfeits technical purity to let grief into the machine. Client’s slumped shoulders and tin-rattle are embodied, specific; no diagnostic self-labeling. Relationship under pressure is the shop itself—its atmosphere acts as crucible, altering both parties’ stance in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the screw becomes a “point of quiet gravity” that re-weights every future drop—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds: fog → drip → screw glisten pattern taught by 25 % and tightened once. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives within 60 words; no penalty. “Nothing changed, and yet everything changed” is the precise beat where causality and texture converge; price is the client’s blurred vision and Mara’s forfeited illusion of neutrality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The water-clock columns, brass floats, and fogged glass constrain every gesture; spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions. Micro-setting (screw-thread, brass stain) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: Mara notices sound, metallic chill, reflected constellations—never scent. Weather (lifting fog) evolves causally, paralleling internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep measuring time after irreplaceable loss—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: installing the screw narrows options from “fix the machine” to “let grief inhabit the machine.” Cost is palpable—client’s blurred vision, Mara’s concession of scientific purity. Escalation is accumulative: each drip re-weights the same screw rather than multiplying reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: screw / drip / outline / pause. No moralizing; final image of “stories condensed…drop by drop” is CR, not explanation. Ambiguity is productive: miracle is “ordinary,” not defined. Subtext lives in gesture—tin-rattle, reluctant droplet—never in thesis sentences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Mara’s listening-to-scent displacement; syntax lengthens with hesitant commas mirroring “hesitant confession.” Dialogue is minimal, natural, goal-driven—“I do not know how to read pauses”—carries subtext of professional identity under threat. No filter-verb stacks; “water slipped through” is direct. Psychic distance tightens from reflective openings to immediate screw-glisten without unmotivated shift.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long mist-openings contract to single-line droplets. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Metaphors (“slow heart leaking grains of water”) stay internally consistent. One paraphrase loop—“time…drop like hesitant confession” echoed as “pauses” three sentences later—minor, does not touch closure. High density: one sentence often anchors setting, body, and metaphor simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist who maps emotion by listening while fixing water-clocks—is non-obvious synthesis. Midwife screw as memory-bone is fresh, not ornamental; its thread literally redirects water. Risk of lyrical engineering dialogue pays off without cliché. Transformation test fails if relocated: fog, scent-loss, drip-screw convergence are irreducibly specific.</comment>
