<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The designer’s motive—turning despair into defiant light—remains concrete through tactile shell-sorting, charcoal sketching, and the fuse-tying micro-choice that seeds the climax. Interior contradiction surfaces in the walking chant that falters yet steadies his hands, showing simultaneous doubt and resolve. Embodied cost arrives when he lights the fuse: the ache-shaped question-mark becomes a fiery palm that risks burning him too. The stance crystallizes as Earned Stasis: he cannot stop the army, but forecloses surrender by gifting the garrison a sky-sized refusal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flaming palm reconfigures the starless night from abyss to cradle, a visible cost paid in spent shells and singed air. Causality holds: each shell placement, the rag-knot graft, and the final fuse-light form a because-therefore chain that narrows options to this single sky-message. The Orientation Test is waived—initial disorientation (no stars, unnamed fortress) is taught early and pays off when the sky becomes readable. Persistent constraint: the absent spinner’s rag knot, once appropriated, becomes the burning seed that shapes the palm’s heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “blooming fortress” is no postcard: vines’ petal-clicks become audible marbles, lantern blackout forces tactile shell-sorting, and the charcoal hand-sketch directly guides fuse routing. Micro-setting supremacy: the rag knot’s fuel scent and cracked flagstones constrain body posture and launch angles. Night-with-no-stars functions as both ceiling and blank canvas, its darkness a material to be rewritten. Final image constraint: the fiery palm can exist only because the courtyard’s geometry and the shells’ crack-alignment were pre-mapped onto stone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—denying despair entrance—tightens when the captain’s demand for progress forces the designer to commit shell-pattern to stone. One meaningful reversal: the knot meant for a spinner becomes the burning seed, swapping entertainment for defiance. Cost is visible: spent shells, scorched air, and the irreversible lighting that forecloses any second attempt. Agency remains internal—no army is fought, yet the night’s meaning is forcibly rewritten under accumulative/textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the motif of hands: the designer’s “ambient awareness” hands, the stone-sketched palm, and the final fiery hand that holds the garrison’s hearts. No moral is stated; the sky itself is repriced from void to cradle. Subtext resides in the knot—entertainment fuel reborn as war-cry. The closing image answers the opening ache-shaped question-mark with an upward-facing palm, achieving Conceptual Repricing without abstraction.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: “soft clicks, like cautious marbles,” “orange eye” of the workfire, “serious playfulness” in fuse-flicking—each perception filtered through a pyrotechnician’s synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences for starless dread, staccato chant-breaths while wiring. No head-hopping; even the captain’s watch is rendered as external silhouette. Compression under pressure: “Wander wide, fire inside, ash to guide” collapses philosophy into barefoot patter. Final line’s upward thrust mirrors the designer’s internal lift, voice and event synchronized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentences multi-task: “He listens now to the fortress itself, inhales fear and pollen, filters them through his ribcage” relays action, metaphor, and emotional alchemy in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. Metaphors stay physically coherent—fire ladder, marble petals, palm of rockets—never mixed. Read-aloud rhythm: the three-beat chant reappears in varied syntactic slots, preventing drumbeat monotony. Minor elevation: “bruised petals” risks purple but earns its keep by conflating flora and wartime injury.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—fireworks as siege defense—flips the warfare trope into luminous non-violence. Specific synthesis: ambient-awareness shell-sorting, blooming stone fortress, and rag-knot repurposing create a recipe unlikely to survive relocation. Risk: starless sky could feel generic, yet here it becomes writable parchment. The fiery palm is inevitable in hindsight because the charcoal sketch and crack-alignment were seeded early. Fresh inflection: siege story ends not with breach but with a sky that “feels held,” a reversal of expected catharsis.</comment>
