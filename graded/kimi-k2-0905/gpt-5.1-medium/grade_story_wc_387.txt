<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradiction—wanting validation yet fearing ridicule—surfaces in the brother insult and the final half-opened-lantern chest, but we never watch a micro-choice under pressure; the arc is told rather than dramatized. Ren acts as mentor-only; his “modest, almost mischievous pride” is asserted, not embodied in a risky on-page decision. Closure is Earned Stasis, cost legible, but the emotional shift is narrated in summary (“something eased inside me”) rather than shown through body or deed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: demure-audacity stance crystallizes in the whisk-droplet test, reweighting the invisible-labor stake with visible cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening beat—the moon-path flick—suffices, but causality is soft: moonlight is treated as agent (“the current does half the work”) without establishing rules earlier. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. Reflection stays under 20 % and feeds the present choice, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Whispering parapet, firefly lanterns, and moon-silver ladders are vividly selective and filtered through apprentice POV; the bamboo whisk serves as micro-setting that constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track across slick stone. Environment never forces a trade-off or failure, so it charges but does not ultimately constrain the closure image—capping entry below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validate invisible effort—arrives early; pressure tightens once when Ren demands the moon-path mimic, foreclosing the option to stay passive. Cost is legible (failed drops, internal “tight place” easing), but escalation is mentor-driven rather than protagonist-initiated; agency is receptive, not decisive. Sufficient for the length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges through whisk-droplets and net-math rather than lecture; final image crystallizes the concept without moralizing. Subtext in Ren’s shrug carries pride and mourning, complicating the mentor role. No thematic echo phrases; resonance is particular, not abstract. Could ascend higher if earlier beats showed societal cost of invisibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a hushed, rhythmic cadence that matches canal-at-night attention; perceptual signature notices “quivering green sparks” and “silver ladders” in apprentice-specific hierarchy. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax breathes with scene pace. No dialogue to test, but interior idiom stays consistent. Whisk-handling verbs (“spun,” “flicked,” “creaked”) give tactile propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are dense—every sentence carries figurative load—but pattern is taught early (“shadows carried small, floating lanterns”) and sustains lyric contract; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“whispering parapet…whispering”) repeats across paragraphs, a −0.2 dent. Otherwise information-dense, clauses varied, final line earns its lift. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Mentor-teaches-apprentice via moonlit droplets is fresh embroidery on the hidden-work theme; whisk-as-compass feels specific to this canal culture. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but coherence justifies the mode. Could edge higher if the apprentice’s final insight carried an irreversible consequence rather than internal mood shift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: Ren appears by line 7. Development: net-math equation (“fifteen nets worth of labor”) reframes apprentice effort. Closure: his earlier moon-path philosophy is requoted while apprentice attempts droplets—stakes reweighted. Causal pressure is advisory, not adversarial, keeping score sub-7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Whisk introduced line 6, handled in puddle-flick beat, creaks under torque, and serves as the tool that channels moon-path lesson; final droplet arc is the story’s test beat. Removing it collapses the tactile demonstration and the closing image. Cost visible in missed drops and wooden creak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Hidden patterns frame apprentice desire, guide Ren’s instruction, and are literalized in moonlit droplets aligning with current; concept narrows tactic choice (“lean with that current”). Final reprise in “sky no one could quite ignore” reweights meaning. Slight short of higher band because pattern rules are asserted rather than tested for risk.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Trait tagged twice; no beat shows how “scintillatingly somber” restricts an action or exacts cost. Mournful smile at apprentice success hints at emotional price but remains ornamental. Middle development gate missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Whistle triggers firefly flare that illustrates “demure audacity,” framing the work philosophy; it is recalled in closing paragraph as model behavior. Not causally pivotal—apprentice does not imitate whistle—but necessary for thematic bridge. Swappable with another modest sound, capping below 7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Moon paths signaled early (line 23), mechanics shown via droplet arc, and final apprentice attempt follows same method. Technique shapes the test beat and ending image; removing it deletes the instruction metaphor. Instructions remain abstract, preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Parapet whisper sets auditory atmosphere, offers literal workspace for whisk flick, and its wetness affects footing and droplet pooling; setting feeds action but never blocks or endangers characters, limiting constraint value. Present in closure image, earns reprise credit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade>
<comment>Firefly season supplies floating lanterns motif but does not tighten a clock or alter tactical options; time feels eternal night rather than tracked duration. Decorative more than functional, though visually integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Desire declared line 9, conflicted through brother insult memory, and tested in whisk-droplet beat; final internal easing shows change with cost (acknowledging unseen labor). Drives every beat; removal erases story engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Tone named once, embodied in shy whistle and cautious droplet attempt; modulation from insecurity to half-opened lantern maps growth while retaining modesty. Coherent across beats but not acute enough to force failure or triumph, capping below 7.</comment>
