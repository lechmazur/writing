<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s “quietly analytic” nature is shown, not told, in the clinical way he inventories the drowned library and measures panic; the decisive choice to compromise rather than fully salvage or abandon the experiment is credibly rooted in his lifelong habit of partial recovery. Interiority stays concrete—gloved brush against a snow globe, hesitation before prying the cylinder—without therapeutic self-labeling. The cost is visible: the closing “compromise that felt like mourning” lets the sea keep part of the data, foreclosing perfect certainty. Slight deduction for late arrival of the physicist’s motive—our first real glimpse comes inside the note, so the narrator’s identification with him is more asserted than dramatized in earlier beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s decision to split the salvage—cylinder up, globes left—reweights the premise, making the physics of letting go empirical and personal. Causal linkage holds: every beat from globe-touch to cylinder-theft drives this final choice; no lucky rescue. Orientation is firm by line 6 (who = wreck-mapper, where = coral cliff, when = post-Earhart). Cost is on-page: “felt like mourning” acknowledges irreversible loss of experimental purity. Lens is Causal; each because/therefore tightens until the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting—the rib-cage hull, pulped-book forest, glass spheres adrift—constrains every move: the narrator must decide what can ascend through the same water that dissolves the rest. Sensory selection is POV-biased: a “cracked ribcage” and “dumb pages” filter wreck-mechanic’s shorthand for entropy. Spatial choreography is clean; globes tethered to a collapsed chandelier stay trackable. Environment charges the final image: the compromise is literally what will float versus what will remain entombed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to honor the physicist’s experiment by allowing some data to stay untouchable—tightens once, decisively, when the narrator realizes full retrieval would “smother the very uncertainty.” Agency is present: he actively loosens the cylinder and signals ascent, leaving the globes. Visible price is the “mourning” of imperfect knowledge. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is internal and conceptual, sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—letting go as measurable buoyancy—emerges through objects (books sink, globes rise) rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration reweights “last transmission” from salvage to surrender, offering non-literal answer: knowledge itself must drown partially to stay alive. No moralizing summary; the image of drifting globes carries the insight. Ambiguity is meaningful: we feel the loss even as we grasp the necessity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: wreck-mapper’s idiom of “first name basis with death,” “physics of letting go,” and rib-cage metaphors stays consistent. Syntax mirrors analytic mind—parallel clauses, quantifying metaphors—yet frays under pressure (“even my mind started to fray”). No dialogue to distort voice. POV distance stable; no filter-verb clutter. Compression during ascent (“trail of silt”) heightens tempo without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences often do three jobs—“Inside, instead of cargo, there was a library” advances plot, setting, theme. Mixed metaphors avoided; rib-cage → paper forest → glass lungs evolve organically. Rhythm breathes: long sentences for descent, clipped fragments inside decompression chamber. No paraphrase loops; each detail adds new angle on buoyancy. Proofing clean; pronoun “its” consistently refers to ship. Closure image unmarred by ornamental language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: combines post-Earhart salvage, drowned library, and experimental bibliophysics into one coherent stake. Risk of preciousness neutralized by narrator’s clinical tone. Snow-globe-as-data-point is an indelible particular; removal would collapse both plot and metaphor. Conceptual integrity absolute—story commits fully to the premise that emotion alters mass. Transformation test passed: plot could not survive rename/reskin.</comment>
