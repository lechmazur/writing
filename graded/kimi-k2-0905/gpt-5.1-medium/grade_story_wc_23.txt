<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rian’s prosthetic hand, brass-and-bone creak, and decision to lie “because sometimes raw solace is all that keeps a person moving” embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the cost of that lie is felt. Interiority is concrete, filtered through borrowed charts and phantom aches. Micro-choice—cupping the censer foot to steady drifting signals—reveals value hierarchy. Closure renunciation (mapping ruins for Mara) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional toll.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as earned renunciation: Rian charts a road that no longer exists, paying the cost of deliberate false cartography. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake of “reverse migration.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by ~80 words inside the failing station. Persistent constraint—dead hydraulics, analog console, single landline—shapes every tactic; cost is legible in the final image of trembling maps under an almost-full moon.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Signal station breathes phosphorescence, cables droop like “tired veins,” moonlight slips through cracked ceiling to green the censer foot—details constrain choice by giving Rian only analog tools and tide-tightened concentration. Salt-flat town, bronze-smith stall, dry fountain are economically named yet evoke entire lost civilization. Spatial choreography clean: receiver lifted, censer foot cupped, charcoal scratches backward rivers. Final image—moonlight on corrosion—charges closure by turning artifact into holy compass.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Rian chart Mara home through geography of loss—signaled in first paragraph; tightens when each named ruin forecloses hope of intact destination. Escalation is accretive: every recalled site increases emotional freight until silence on line “aches like a wound pressed to glass.” Agency visible: decision to lie, to keep drawing, to transmit false coordinates with acknowledged cost. Price—Rian’s complicity in guiding Mara toward absence—felt in final breathless dark.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: reverse migration as return to ruination; maps that chart loss rather than arrival. Subtext in gesture—cupping censer foot, whispering name into cold mouthpiece—implies ritual without exposition. Final image reweights premise: bronze corrosion made “almost holy” under starlight, reframing salvage as sacrament. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—does the lie serve mercy or self-presurance?</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, synesthetic: “antennae shiver as the night wind tests their forgotten resolve,” “air tastes like iron and salt.” Rhythm mirrors failing hydraulics—long sentences sag, then tighten into staccato directives. Perceptual signature distinct: patchwork navigator sees world as circuitry of drifting signals. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“starlit signal station sighs”) and paid off in final cadence where moon steadies maps.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density—lines perform double duty: “cables droop like tired veins” paints setting and foreshadows system death. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Zero scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“geometry of loss,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within Rian’s chart-maker lexicon. Final line cadence—“where it can soften”—gives quiet exhale without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-collapse cartography via analog console and salvaged liturgy object. Reverse migration trope re-angled—people stream back toward ruins not to rebuild but to house ghosts. Specific inflection: bronze censer foot as compass, corrosion as holy patina. Risk—lyric density in short form—pays off when closure recharges every prior image. Conceptual integrity maintained; no retreat into facile hope.</comment>
