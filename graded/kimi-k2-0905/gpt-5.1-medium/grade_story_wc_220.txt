<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s motive—using sound to re-bridge loss—stays consistent and personal; the stranger’s arrival forces a micro-choice to play the cylinder, exposing maternal grief. Barrow’s mournful attention embodies the stakes without anthropomorphic gimmickry. Interiority avoids label-speak; the final shared vigil is a credible, costly endurance. Voice distinction between narrator and stranger is slight, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to share the cylinder reweights guilt into communal witness, cost felt in the thickening hush. Causal chain holds: stranger arrives → cylinder played → revelation heard → choice to keep it circulating. Orientation anchors within 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via layered voices and color-grooves; no contradiction at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Scrapyard constellation, rusted junk, waxed leaf—each detail is filtered through the narrator’s sound-oriented gaze and constrains the final choice to broadcast rather than bury. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies, bench, shelf, dog position track. No static postcard dumps; sensory economy favors tactile and aural over visual excess. The leaf above Barrow charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep or spread dangerous memory—tightens once when the needle drops and options narrow to sharing. Cost is legible: the stranger’s tear-tracks, narrator’s risk of warlord reprisal, dog’s whine. Escalation is single but decisive under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Persistent constraint: the cylinder’s mutable testimony will keep wounding each listener.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is a fire you can’t extinguish, only pass on. Subtext lives in Barrow’s sniff, the leaf’s bottled sunset, the choice to keep the door open—each reweights guilt into communal witness. Final image of leaf-glow over snoring dog offers resonant non-literal answer. No sermonizing; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, phonographic timbre—crackle embedded in syntax. Perceptual signature is sound-first, color-second, matching the narrator’s trade. No head-hop; distance stable. Dialogue sparse but distinct: stranger’s “careful stillness” vs narrator’s softer invitational tone. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for cylinder playback, clipped beats for tear-track moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer scent, color, sound without crowding. One mixed metaphor—“horizon bled orange behind mountains of scrap”—is momentary, not closure-touching. No template cadence or synonym loops. Opening and closing lines carry acoustic echo, satisfying read-aloud test. Minor overwrite in “rusted constellation” phrase keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-tinted glass phonograph cylinder as mutable memory bomb is new, grounded in salvagepunk logic. Risk—letting historic guilt stay open-ended—pays off in Charged Poise. Autumn leaf reprise feels inevitable, not ornamental. Conceptual integrity: refuses to let forgetting be another fire, embracing perpetual circulation of painful witness.</comment>
