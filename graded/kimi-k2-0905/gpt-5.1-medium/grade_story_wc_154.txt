<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory duties—translator vs reluctant confessor—are alive in every beat; her decision to lie about the illegible line is a micro-choice that costs her moral neutrality and forecloses her remove from the war. The boy’s shrewd innocence and the mother’s silent hand-off press Mara into a stance she cannot exit; the coral in her pocket is the visible price. Interiority stays embodied (“my lifeline”) and avoids label-speak. Only the surgeon’s off-stage “time” mutter keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the swinging doors sever Mara from the boy while the coral’s weight in her pocket reweights her role from medium to bearer of unrecoverable past. Causal linkage holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore: coral in leg → consent dilemma → translation of cast → lie → acceptance of complicity. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“mist-clad atrium”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s blurred reflection in the glass literalizes her newly complicit identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The misted greenhouse glass, iodine reek, and potted civilians compress the war into a single liminal room; the brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the surgical path and later charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: Mara notices linguistic sediment, not botanical names. Spatial choreography is clean—gurney, tray, cast, mother’s hand-off track without drift. Only the off-shore mortars risk postcard exoticism, but they remain unheard by the boy, keeping the locale intimate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mara stay professionally neutral—tightens when the boy asks her to translate the cast and again when she swallows the coral; each beat narrows her ethical options. Agency is continuous: she decrypts, improvises the sea-lie, and accepts the coral, each act increasing complicity. The cost is legible on-page: her reflection in the glass is “undeniably afraid,” a stasis that forecloses neutrality. Escalation is linear rather than revelatory, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation is never neutral; every word is a graft that wounds and heals simultaneously. The coral migrates from shrapnel to evidence to keepsake to moral anchor, its final weight repricing the entire concept of “foreign object.” Subtext operates in silence—the mother’s hand-off says more than any consent clause. The ending’s image (Mara’s blurred face) answers the thematic question by refusing a moral, leaving the reader complicit in the lie.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mara thinks in maritime metaphors (“sedimentary scars,” “tide lines”) and linguistic precision (“creole of the northern atolls”). Syntax tightens under pressure—“lotus-hearted ache” is compressed diction that still fits her translator’s ear. No head-hopping; even the boy’s whisper is filtered through her decoding ear. The rhythmic control of long breathless sentences against the final single-line paragraph accelerates the poise without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive: every sentence advances either the surgical countdown or Mara’s ethical slide. Metaphors are precise—“coral turned shrapnel by politics” fuses geology and geopolitics without strain. Only one mixed image (“lotus-hearted ache”) momentarily jars, but it is earned by the boy’s anesthetic haze. No scaffold, loops, or simultaneity errors; high-information lines (“She pressed it into my palm without meeting my eyes”) do triple duty: action, status shift, moral baton pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—brain coral as both wound and witness—feels inevitable yet fresh; no existing war story fuses reef ecology with surgical consent. The translator’s ethical complicity via a child’s cast graffiti is a risk that pays off: the cast becomes a living palimpsest of civilian fear. Specificity anchors universals—“northern atolls creole” roots the conflict without exposition. Final image of translator blurred into combatant reconfigures the entire genre of war-zone witness.</comment>
