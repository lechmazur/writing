<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is granular and body-anchored; the amber pendant as inheritance is a believable pressure source. Yet her shift from viral pariah to cooperative gardener is more asserted than dramatized—no micro-choice visibly costs her lingering shame or safety, so the renunciation feels soft rather than staked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: viral confession → site abandonment → Eli’s invitation → joint planting, each step tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: their shared kneeling in moss forecloses retreat to anonymity while promising slow growth; cost is legible in her soaked jeans and public exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is protagonist: dripping skylights, rusty bolts as “broken teeth,” server racks become trellises—each detail guides literal footing and metaphoric repair. The pendant’s glow refracted through hanging cables physically charges the final image, fusing memory and future in one visual beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Mara re-enter the world she exposed?—is signaled early. Escalation arrives when she kneels to plant: the public shame is not erased but physically worked-through, a single decisive tightening under causal lens; cost is the damp seeping through fabric, a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative accountability emerges through living grafts, never slogans. The moss garden reweights the data-center’s original sin into slow atonement without declaring victory, achieving resonance via the pendant’s final glint amid chlorophyll—an image that reframes prior guilt as cultivation material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mara’s sensorium—syntax tightens under stress, metaphors stay within her lexicon (“honeyed hush,” “skin thin as old wiring”). No head-hop; dialogue carries subtext in half-spoken invitations that expose both characters simultaneously.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—longer clauses for approach, clipped fragments when she kneels. No metaphor clutter; each figure extends moss/server fusion. Minor scaffold: “together they pressed…” re-states action already implied, but the final line lands clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Freshens the familiar “whistle-blower returns” arc by turning the crime scene into a literal garden; the moss-icicle pattern is a specific, non-portable device. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, lyric tone—but coherence never falters, giving the twist an inevitable feel.</comment>
