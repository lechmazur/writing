<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—"I did not want to win by hollowing him out" crystallizes the self-vs-clone tension. Guilt over the surgeon is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choice to lower the blade is earned and costs the narrator any easy victory, satisfying earned stasis. Voice slips toward diagnostic shorthand once ("almost like real fear"), but overall the arc from numbness to trembling choice is dramatized, not told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each memory-strike tightens the stakes for custodianship of the jarred mind. The final refusal to erase guilt is a decisive change with visible cost—Kesh’s nod signals the ruling is now tainted by mercy. History-rewrites are taught early and payoff at closure when the dojo rocks drift closer, literalizing the rewritten verdict. No orientation debt; anchoring floats but serves the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rocks, glass tendrils, and history-flicker skyline are selective, never touristic. The brain jar’s fizz and the translucent sound-floor constrain footwork and swordplay, integrating setting into action. Micro-setting qualifies: the childhood bedroom projection is the battlefield where choices stick. Final image—dojo stones drifting closer—recharges the “history rewrites” motif with spatial cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who becomes the authentic guardian—tightens with every memory-slash; options narrow as shared experiences vanish. Escalation is causal: defending vs attacking memories reweights moral legitimacy. Visible price: surrendering victory to preserve guilt forecloses the “algorithmic compost” fate. The final stance crystallizes under pressure, fulfilling earned stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of authentic selfhood emerges from the parrying of memories, not exposition. The jar’s label “duplicate” is repriced when guilt is kept—the backup becomes the moral original. Subtext operates in silence: lowering the blade speaks louder than any argument. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing: history rewrites, but mercy is the new law.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a detached, post-ego texture—“faint shadows of themselves”—that slowly frays into trembling. Syntax lengthens under stress, mirroring returning sensation. No head-hopping; Arin-2 is externalized through gesture and blade. Occasional elevated diction (“vivify,” “conceptual repricing”) feels at home in the surreal courtroom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with each memory-clash, breathing only at the final plea. Metaphors are concrete—“fluid fizzed like soda”—and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or stakes. No scaffold; even the history-rewrites are shown via cities crumbling in silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Clone-custody duel via memory-striking feels inevitable yet fresh. Surreal legal arena fuses martial-arts metaphysics with bioethics. Risk: surrendering victory to save guilt—bold inversion of courtroom triumph. Specific detail—“orange robe snapping,” “glass tendrils”—anchors the odd premise in sensory reality.</comment>
