<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—hope of life from rot versus fear of deathly bloom—drives every beat and is embodied in sensory micro-choices (trembling hands, salt of fear). The elders’ status shift is legible in Maru’s surrender nod, but only Liora acts; no second character exerts sustained pressure, so relationship crucible tests don’t apply. Final renunciation of safety is causally earned yet cost is felt more atmospherically than viscerally. Still, her olfactory lens and notebook compulsion individuate her; no label-speak occurs in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the village inhales, options reweighted by the planted seed whose future stench is now inevitable; conceptual cost is undeniable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of scent motifs and rope-creak cadence tighten until the pause at moss cradle. Causality holds: confession → seed → ascent → permission → planting, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) delivered by sentence 3; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Treetop village is no postcard: swaying walkways, creaking houses, resin ghosts constrain every step and literally steady her heartbeat; the corpse-flower cradle on the highest branch is the charged final image. Olfactory micro-setting (salt fear, metal storm, crushed moss) filters every detail through Liora’s professional bias. Spatial choreography clean—rope bridges, platform arrival, moss patch—all tracked without impossible moves. Environment forecloses retreat: storms stranger, roots thirstier, hence elders consider descent; setting materially shapes stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the village remain aloft—signaled early and braided to Liora’s private stake of coaxing life from decay. One meaningful tightening: elders move from refusal to conditional permission, foreclosing her safe return; cost is elders’ surrender and her exposure. Agency is decision/attention rather than physical battle; coincidence absent. Under accumulative lens, scent density and storm pattern intensify until the final inhale reweights stakes; price is legible if atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: confronting rot to learn stillness inside decay. No explicit moral; final image of communal inhale offers resonant non-literal answer. Recurring scent motif (resin, sour whisper, stench) reweights from warning to wisdom-source at closure. Avoids tidy binaries—life/death, up/down remain porous—but complexity is felt more than argued, keeping reflection just under 20 % and anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: every line filtered through olfactory lexicon (“resin ghosts,” “salt of fear,” “bitter root tea clinging to their breath”). Rhythm modulates with ascent—longer breathless sentences mimic swaying bridges, then compress at planting. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior free-indirect clean. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Diction stays within plausible herbalist lexicon; no register drift. Final image syntax—“the whole village inhaled to listen”—crystallizes cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings scatter, no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence often carries scent, emotional charge, and spatial cue: “Wind made the houses creak like old throats, yet beneath the sound lay a wildflower hush that steadied her heartbeat.” Metaphors coherent and physically plausible; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “braided tight like the cords” slightly repeats earlier rope image, but does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: olfactory navigation + corpse flower as civic mirror + treetop village facing climate rot is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Trope of apocalyptic arboreal colony is transformed through sensory herbalist gaze and notebook ritual. Risk taken with quiet ending—no bloom, only planted seed—but Charged Poise keeps stakes alive. Slight proximity to “storm forces tree exile” motif keeps it from full 8+ band, yet specificity of scent-based worldhood elevates beyond template.</comment>
