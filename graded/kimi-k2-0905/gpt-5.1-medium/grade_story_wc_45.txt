<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly particular—“forgiving only people, and only if they learned from the smudges”—and her bone-setter’s gaze physically embodies the skepticism.  The decision to step through the “aching doorway” is earned by her prior refusal to accept the too-neat corpse and by the tactile memory of Tomas’s garden experiments.  Micro-choices—palming the tooth, feeling it tug at the fracture in certainty—show contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) acting simultaneous in scene.  Cost is visible: she trades her fracture of doubt for the embodied labor of re-aligning an alien child, leaving her with “almost bearable” doubt—an earned stasis that forecloses return to her earlier complacency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the substitute body dissolving into soil reweights the entire premise—doubt itself becomes fertile.  The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (the too-exact corpse as counterfeit text) and tightens through iterative images of forgery, receipts, and star-maps until the final soil-crumble crystallizes the cost.  Causality holds: Tomas’s prior theft of the tooth and planting of the fake body are motivated by his “absurdly precise” compassion; Mara’s finishing of the rescue is the necessary physical act that repays the error.  Persistent constraint—the changeling child’s mis-aligned bones—shapes every tactical move of the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret garden is not backdrop but instrument: its shifting hedge walls and glass tools constrain how Mara can move and what she can “set.”  The moonlit cloth in the breathing tin box is a micro-setting object that literally warms her palm and charges the final image.  Sensory hierarchy follows bone-setter priorities—she notices weight, torque, temperature—so the tooth’s impossible warmth is noticed first, not its color.  Spatial choreography is clean: the maze opens “as always” onto the hidden plot of ground where the final re-alignment occurs, keeping bodies and distances trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether doubt or belief will govern action—tightens when the tooth tugs at the “cleft in certainty,” forcing Mara either to seal the fracture or walk through it.  Escalation is textural: each image (counterfeit scars, moonlit cloth, violet sky) deepens the cost of being wrong.  The protagonist’s agency drives every beat: her decision to realign the boy bone-by-bone is the irreversible act that dissolves the substitute corpse.  Price is visible—her certainty is permanently fissured, and she must now live with navigable doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: forgiveness is a bone-setting art applied to the universe’s clerical errors, turning misfiles into navigable constellations.  The final image of soil where the counterfeit once lay reconfigures the moral calculus—mistakes are not erased but composted into new growth.  Subtext operates in gesture: the tooth’s warmth is the universe’s quiet apology.  No tidy moral is offered; ambiguity lingers in “almost bearable,” inviting reader reflection on whether doubt is weakness or instrument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person bone-setter voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—bones speak louder than faces, scars are “careful handwriting.”  Rhythm flexes with pressure: short, hinge-like sentences during realignment (“bone by bone”) mirror the tactile precision of her craft.  No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Mara-bound.  Diction stays within village apothecary lexicon—“shrewdly innocent contraptions,” “borrowed starlight”—avoiding register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “the still mouth was too well tuned” packs counterfeit thesis into six words.  No loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances the star-map motif or deepens the fracture metaphor.  Mixed-metaphor guard passes—“constellations” and “smudges” coexist because both are anchored to Tomas’s blueprint.  Closing line “doubt felt almost bearable” gives cadence shift that resolves the lyric accumulation without explain-all exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar faerie-changeling trope is inverted: the theft is an act of restorative justice, not predation, and the human becomes the adapter of alien anatomy.  Specificity—“glass instruments he had blown himself,” “violet sky”—makes the otherworld feel locally invented rather generically mythic.  Risk-taking in structure (Accumulative/Textural constellation) pays off because pattern is taught early and closure reweights it.  The premise would collapse if names or tools were swapped; the bone-setter’s occupational logic is inextricable from the resolution.</comment>
