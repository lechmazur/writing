<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“texture of my days”), but the narrator’s contradictory impulses stay verbal; no micro-choice dramatizes the tug between safe job and expansion. The poet’s “ethically playful” trait is shown only in reported backstory, not in-scene action. Closure choice is implied, not embodied—no on-page forfeiture—so the cost is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrival of beings → stalled road → grotto → layered conversation → reweighted choice. Closure is a Charged Poise: options are reconfigured (“the choice was mine alone”) with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One minor causality gap: rope’s prior use is told, not shown, softening the symbolic price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto glows like “a wound and a womb,” body-cooling clay, moonlit lip—details filter through narrator’s fatigue and wonder. The rope’s metallic sweat-smell and silvered fibers are tactile, later recharging the “texture of time” metaphor. Setting constrains: the hollow’s thermal and visual intimacy forces the existential conversation that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shrink vs. expand life’s texture—signaled early and tightened when poet reframes energy beings as witnesses. One deepening: narrator’s private triad (job, lover, scholarship) is exposed and costed. No visible price on-page; escalation is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grotto-as-womb/wound and rope-as-escaped-time, not thesis: choice is between automatic safety and porous, risky temporality. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. “Texture of time” could feel abstract, but clay, rope, and starlight ground it. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic, and biased: “backpack biting,” “ethically playful sin against time.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under decision pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” diction, but within narrator’s philosophical reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; metaphors are selective, not stacked. One paraphrase loop: “texture of time” repeated without new sensory twist. No mixed vehicles, no filter-verb clusters. Final paragraph keeps propulsion; closing line lands by image, not explanation. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Alien-arrival trope is inverted: beings as passive witnesses, not invaders. Rope-from-prison becomes metaphysical metronome. “Ethically playful” warden-stars feel fresh. Risk is conceptual, not plot-twist; freshness lies in reframing stalled modern life as experimental cage. Could edge higher with more visceral cost.</comment>
