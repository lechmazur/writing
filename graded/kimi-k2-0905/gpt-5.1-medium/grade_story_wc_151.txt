<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular—Neve’s “second, slower heartbeat” under their ribs embodies the stakes. The chalk-code marginalia externalizes a layered internal contradiction: bureaucrat vs. child-survivor. The final micro-choice—still holding the envelope on the slot—earns credible Earned Stasis: forgiveness delayed is cost paid. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; flaw (inventing selves) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of alias-candidates tightens until the single name Marin Verge crystallizes meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: envelope poised on slot reweights every prior alias as futures foregone. Cost legible in “apology”-fold and palm-seal heat. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60 (“golden arcade at dawn”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arcade’s glass ribs and analog counter function as constraint-objects: only here can Neve physically “hinge” time. Light progression (gold→bleached coin) tracks internal pressure and cues final withheld drop. Clipboard and chalk dust act as micro-setting that alters tactics—columns vs margins. Sensory selectivity favors touch (palm heat, chalk) over visual catalog, suiting bureaucratic POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Neve invent a name that lets a stranger forgive themself—tightens when sender’s note removes return address, foreclosing revision. Subconscious-review checkbox and chalk code are micro-turns that narrow options to Marin Verge. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal-ethical. Cost is the unmailed moment itself—future kept in hand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: identity as editable palimpsest vs. irreversible time. Final image answers the margin-question “Are you still there?” with silent poise rather than thesis. Ambiguity lingers—letter may never leave—yet cost is undeniable. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific alias alchemy (shore + brink).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: bureaucratic precision (“pseudonym creator for the Ministry of Correspondence”) braided with childhood cryptography. Syntax modulates from latinate clauses to fragment-coded chalk. No dialogue, so voice convergence waived. Final compression—“whole future pause on the edge of the drop”—rhythmic echo of earlier “slower heartbeat,” paying off pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence folds job, philosophy, and stakes (“licensed to invent lives that letters could wear”). Metaphors stay coherent (glass ribs, bleached coin) without mixed vehicle. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Minor templated cadence in “Each name hovered…” trio, but it serves accumulative beat and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—bureaucrat who sells reincarnation via delayed mail—is fresh, yet grounded in tactile postal relic. Sidewalk-chalk ciphers transform familiar childhood code into adult survival tool. Risk: lyric stasis ending; payoff is undeniable reweighting. Transformation test fails if relocated—alias-permutation needs analog slot and dawn arcade. Specificity of “Subconscious Review” checkbox invented in margin nudges reality convincingly.</comment>
