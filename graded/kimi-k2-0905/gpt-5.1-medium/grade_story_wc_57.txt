<question>1</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Eli’s interiority stays anchored in tactile seed-and-rope perception; the fulgurite’s shiver and his calluses tracing hemp give embodied contradiction between collector-urge and preservation-urge. The final bow conveys earned renunciation, but the woman’s dissolve feels slightly convenient, muting the cost that could push this to 8+.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens holds: each knot-read thickens texture until the lantern-lit fulgurite reframes the rope into legible memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-cast when Eli realizes seeds and cords are co-equal archives—cost felt in the whitening dock and the winter stillness he now must tend.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Golden dock, snow, and lantern-light constrain every move: frost soaks trousers, rope crust jams fingers, light-slit through glass is the only aperture into past voices. The pier’s gilded boards charge the final image, turning the altar metaphor into tangible obligation.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve ancient methods”—tightens when Eli learns the method is rope, not seed. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; price is the infinite patience he must now practice, implied by snow mounting on his shoulders.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory migrates to humblest hosts—rope, seed, knot—not libraries. Final image of “seeds and knots of the world turn slowly” offers resonant re-pricing without moralizing, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric-philosophic diction stays internally coherent; fulgurite “remembered something” and “slow thought” fog are POV-true metaphors. Rhythm modulates from hush to bright flare without head-hop; perceptual signature is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“snow soaked his trousers… hemp and twist”) do double duty; no synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“fog rolled like a slow thought”—is earned by pattern, not muddled; zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Rope-as-manuscript is fresh, fully followed: knot = sentence, reader = callus. Risk—quiet, lyric, no antagonist—pays off because pressure is epistemic, not kinetic. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
