<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s need to guard the covenant is embodied in daily ritual; the contradictory pull between speech and silence peaks when he opens the box for Mara. Micro-choice—lifting the lid instead of speaking—carries visible cost: color spills over the ghost, locking him further into solitude. Interiority stays concrete: his mouth refuses “what my silence could not do better.” The final renunciation (keeping the box as witness) is earned and forecloses return to the village of the living.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dawn vigil layers silence until the stained light finally reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism on Mara’s chest makes the cost of guardianship legible without solving it. Persistent constraint—the covenant grooves rising like welts—shapes the keeper’s tactics throughout. One transition (yard → shed) is clean; orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The apiary’s warped frames and glassy dunes filter every decision: proximity to the shed dictates ritual, the cracked hives embody abandonment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—beeswax dust motes, wind-hiss—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography holds as Mara phases through the wall and dust constellations briefly swirl. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; without its colored spill the covenant could not refract onto the ghost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving unsaid words—tightens when ghosts learn to cast shadows, threatening to void the keeper’s life-work. One meaningful deepening: the grooves become legible, forcing acknowledgement that the villagers’ knots must be sorted by him alone. Cost is felt: the prismed glow fixes him as eternal witness, foreclosing re-entry into human chatter. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, aligning with Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the slow accretion of color and silence rather than statement: the unsaid gains weight only if someone agrees to bear it. Subtext lives in gesture—the tilt of a spectral head—never exposition. The final image reframes the covenant as partnership between silence and meaning, a conceptual re-pricing that resists moralizing. No motif is forced; the stained glass and beekeeping gear stay particular to this keeper’s grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyrically compressed yet taught by line one: “the day the ghosts finally learned to cast shadows.” Syntax mirrors beekeeper precision: short, pollen-dense clauses; metaphors stay within apiary logic (“a bee that chose not to sting”). No head-hopping; Mara’s voice is ventriloquized through air-bloom, keeping focalization strict. Rhythmic control heightens at climax without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, varied sentence openings. Figurative language is sparse and apian—never purple. High information density: “soldering saints and suns into a small reliquary of color” does triple world/character/religious duty. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “glass” references could fuse, but this does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-archive + beekeeping + stained-glass reliquary feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted. Risk—making silence the active protagonist—pays off by charging the final hush. Transformation test fails if relocated to any non-apiary setting; specificity anchors the concept. No familiar cinematic ghost tropes; the covenant grooves pressed into glass provide a singular archive mechanic.</comment>
