<comment>Lan’s interior contradiction—professional duty vs. dread of institutional prophecy—surfaces in the micro-choice to lie to Maro (“It is not for you”). Embodied ink-stained fingers and the slow-match of remembered phonograph whir give tactile individuality. Flaw is present: he clings to archival ritual under looming futility, and the cost—being the next voice in the spiral—lands as Earned Stasis. Still, we get no concrete beat where he nearly refuses or disobeys, so the renunciation feels intellectual rather than muscle-trembling.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Lan realizes the wax archives an earlier scribe imposing the same emotional weather he now enforces, looping oath into prophecy. Causal chain holds—because the wax survives, therefore Lan’s method exists, therefore he must perpetuate the pattern—visible cost is the foreclosure of escape (“he would speak an accidental prophecy”). Single-scene orientation is secured by the fifth sentence; no penalty. Lens is Causal; linkage intact, no late ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The ancient orchard atop steel is not mere postcard; it supplies the very stones and gauze labels that enable Lan’s archival rite, constraining how the wax is handled. Micro-setting—the velvet-lined box, the fig tree as altar—becomes tactile extension of the tower’s skeleton. Spatial choreography is clean: gravel path, stone altar, Lam’s robed shuffle track logically. Only gap: no sensory acknowledgment of height (wind, sway) to remind us we’re on a skyscraper crown—tiny but keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: personal complicity in institutional foreknowledge vs. refusal to seed future grief. Pressure tightens once: Lan hears the prophetic oath and recognizes his own future voice, narrowing options to replicate or rebel—he chooses replication with visible existential cost. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price (eternal recursion) is felt but not dramatized in body—hence stops short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—archival obsession as self-fulfilling prophecy—emerges through wax, orchard, and Lan’s confession without explicit sermon. Subtext ripples in gesture: stylus laid “like a question mark,” fruit wrapped in names/dates. Final image of “pattern of feeling, not events” reweights prior material, offers CR. Nearly no abstraction; only faint whiff of thesis when Lan names “weather inside the human chest,” but contained inside POV diction so −0.1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, syntactic tide rising with revelation: long languid clauses early, then shorter pulses (“It is not for you”). Perceptual signature—dead language as jewelry, “dialect a loop of obligation around his heart”—distinctive. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (Maro’s “Traffic” fracture). Only micro-slip: “velvet disquiet” edges toward authorial flourish yet fits mood and is pattern-taught early, so waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene: gravel-whisper, fruit-lanterns, wax spiral mirror thematic spiral. Figurative density high but patterned and paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “fruit like muted lanterns” stays consistent. Minor scaffold: “softening every edge into suggestion” could trim, not fatal. Read-aloud ear test passes; opening and closing lines frame stakes and reverb cleanly.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing phonograph ghost, skyscraper orchard, and bureaucratic necromancy yields a fresh mythic engine absent from typical fantasy or cli-fi. Risk in lyric archival method is justified: immersion via breath-matching taught early, payoff at prophecy recognition feels inevitable. Specific detail—wax ribbon “remembering the spiral”—anchors abstraction in tactile object. If premise swapped to USB drive or cloud server, emotional engine collapses, proving irreplaceability. +0.4 risk bonus within band.</comment>
