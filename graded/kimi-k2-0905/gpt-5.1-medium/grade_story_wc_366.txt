<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s reticent watchfulness is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—re-stacking the stones, palming the sea glass, writing an unsigned letter—each one embodying both his grandfather’s code and his own reluctant stewardship. Interior contradiction is vivid: he dismisses ghosts yet trembles; wants to leave yet pockets the ache. The final renunciation—scraping the spiral to “safe”—pays the cost of perpetual, anonymous guardianship, earned by the accretion of observed details rather than an epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the stacking of stones, letters, and the extinguished beam until the green shard refracts a private halo that reweights Elias’s identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rearranged stones and unanswered letter crystallize a lifelong, unpaid duty. Cost is unmistakable—“the luminescent ache” and the scrap of boots erasing the invitation—making the before/after legible: he exits not as delivery man but as secret keeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as micro-setting: the dead lens, iron steps, and stone spiral physically constrain every move; the curved glass fragments the black ocean into a film Elias must edit with his body. Sea glass and kerosene smell are returned in the final image, charging the green halo that reconfigures safety. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions—while the lighthouse’s verticality mirrors the tightening decision ladder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who will keep the unseen watchers—tightens when the spiral points inward; Elias’s agency is to rewrite that sign and accept perpetual, invisible vigilance. Escalation is textural: each discovered letter thickens the moral density until refusing to sign his own becomes the decisive, narrowing act. Cost is the公开的 loneliness he volunteers for, etched in the scraping sound of stones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the privatization of guardianship after public infrastructure fails; the green shard’s ghost-light answers “who protects?” with “those who can’t stop watching.” Subtext lives in gesture: stone patterns speak louder than ink, and silence becomes contract. The ending’s unsent letter refuses a moral, offering only the fragile halo as new, unpaid covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person free indirect style stays latched to Elias’s reticent perceptual filter: “felt the absence of the beam like a missing rib” is bodily, not abstract. Syntax breathes with tidal length, then clips short when he rewrites the stones. No head-hopping; the keeper-letters remain opaque voices outside his skull, preserving distance. Register stays maritime and tactile—no academic leakage.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “black water and white foam slicing around him like shattered film” does triple sensory work without metaphor strain. Varied sentence cadence mirrors climb versus stillness; zero template patterns or synonym loops. Each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge—no scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and extinction; final line fuses shard, halo, and scraped stone into resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: stone-code as proto-text-message between isolated keepers, transforming lighthouse into dead-drop forum. Supply-skipper POV inverts typical heroic keeper tale, making maintenance man into secret inheritor. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when private green beam replaces institutional Fresnel—specific to this voice, not transferable.</comment>
