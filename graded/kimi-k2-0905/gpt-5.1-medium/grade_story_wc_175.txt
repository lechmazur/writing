<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erin’s interiority stays concrete—her fingers choosing twig-by-twig, her ribs counting the wind’s stutter—so her esoteric-realist credo is enacted, not labeled. The knot-making grows logically from past helplessness (pigeons) and present micro-choices, ending in credible Earned Stasis: she keeps building although the butterfly will die. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene, not summary. Only minor gap: we never see her question the cost of her own fuel/food while the grotto drifts—tiny but keeps her from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each braided grass spire adds material density that reweights the stake—“can architecture become a hand?” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch drinks, the grotto drifts on, and the cost is felt in the image of fading orange against spinning moth-wing. Anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3 and are re-anchored each shard; no orientation debt. One micro-turn: the wind’s cadence shifts from threat to invitation once the signal towers align—enough tightening for 800-word scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s physics—floating, dripping, leaf-rot scent—constrains every tactical choice: Erin can only build light, wind-proof signals. The moth-wing’s recycled parchment texture becomes the final mirror of the butterfly’s freckled orange, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is flawless: ledge → petal line → dew bowl; no impossible positions. Environment, tool, and recurring object all meet the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can one person’s craft extend a species’ final breath?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once the wind’s “interrupted cadence” is answered by shifting a twig “here, untangling a root there.” Each adjustment narrows the butterfly’s flight path; luck complicates but does not solve. Visible price: Erin expends finite grotto grasses and her own stamina; the cost is felt when she “held her breath” while the sky “resumed its wandering.” Enough escalation and agency for the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: extinction is not one cataclysm but a series of missed landings; the only reply is to build temporary perches. Subtext lives in gesture—spinning moth-wing as white flag to evolution. Final image reweights premise: the drink is not survival but arrival, a conceptual repricing that lets “blushing stillness” equal forgiveness. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Erin’s perceptual signature—her lexicon of “string,” “fern-exhalation,” “smoke trapped in parchment”—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences in calm, staccato prepositional fragments when wind gusts. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt the pattern in her ribs”) not explanatory. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence mirrors wind—alternating luxuriant coils with clipped prepositional shards. Metaphors stay coherent (green lantern, paper fire) and payoff in final image. Information density high: one sentence can anchor place, reveal backstory, and foreshadow moth-wing reuse. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; only hairline slip—“skywide silence” verges on oxymoron but reads as intentional compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cloud-borne gardener braiding extinction signals—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when architecture becomes compassion. Monarch extinction trope is personalized through Erin’s string-and-ledge engineering, not documentary. Final reconfiguration (“the world had bent around one small history”) reframes all prior grotto migrations, proving synthesis, not gimmick.</comment>
