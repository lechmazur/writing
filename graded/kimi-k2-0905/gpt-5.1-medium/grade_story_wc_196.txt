<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tea thermos, dust-line photograph memory, the button held to light—yet her drive stays reactive; she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything. The “tactfully hopeful smile” is shown only once; the rest is summary. Because no alternate path is ever risked, the arc is observational, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“dust helped her… mapping neglect”) and holds: each box’s dust-thickness becomes the pattern that guides her search, culminating in the charged poise of walking the aisles “feeling the pulse.” Orientation is clear by word 60; closure reweights the premise—files become “lives that might yet be recalled”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal turn is required under this lens; the pattern break suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The file room is rendered through lived indexes—bowed shelves, shaky handwriting, brass button worn “to a tired gleam”—each filtered by Mara’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography is pristine: fingers trace, folders flip, dust lines appear. The micro-setting (the button) constrains her imagination and later charges the brother-visitor beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—“link every orphaned file”—but pressure never tightens; no deadline, budget, or opposing force threatens failure. The brother’s arrival is serendipitous, not earned by her agency. Escalation is textural (dust map) rather than consequential; cost is felt only conceptually at closure, so the tightening is present but mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: dust as cartography of neglect, button as talisman of lost lineage, kindnesses surfacing in reimbursement forms. No moral is stated; the final image of “silent folder offer[ing] at least one remembered kindness” reweights the premise without moralizing. The slight over-explication of “secrecy protected organizations more than children” is the only echo, but it is early and brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter—“a line appear through accumulated dust patterns like developing photographs”—with rhythmic compression and no head-hop. Lexicon stays within her professional reach; diction never drifts into corporate drone. Voice modulates under pressure: short clauses when she holds the button, longer cadences when mapping timelines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and varied; sentences open with concrete noun or prepositional phrase, avoiding template cadence. One scaffold slip—“later love had disappeared too, dissolved in arguments”—is mild paraphrase but does not recur. Metaphors are precise: “tired lung” for fluorescent room, “dandelions in a parking lot” for rare praise. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Foster-record archaeology after emancipation reform is a fresh angle; the dust-as-map device is specific to this premise. The infantryman’s button becoming a brother’s recognition avoids twist-for-twist sake by grounding in prior folder detail. Risk is moderate—quiet archive work—but coherence justifies the choice. Transformation test fails only because Mara’s personal stake could swap with another archivist, thinning inevitability.</comment>
