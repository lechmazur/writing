<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“peeling myself out like a husk” embodies the surreal transit—but the father’s leap into self-erasure is stated more than dramatized, so the daughter’s final renunciation, while moving, feels lightly causally anchored. The contradiction between needing to cross and refusing to cross is present in the silent strip of soil, giving a credible Earned Stasis. Micro-choices (daily chair-shifts) track obsession, but only one carries visible cost (the room tilts). Emotional calibration is convincing; no therapy-speak, yet the father’s cosmic rule-set is asserted, not mined for internal contradiction. Still, the arc of obsessive decoding → discovery → sacrificial standstill lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9− quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the daughter freezes before the “necessary step,” world balance legibly hanging. Causal chain: decoding logbook → terrace jolt → entry to maze → confrontation → renunciation; each because/therefore link advances knowledge and narrows options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“town floated on a drifting prism terrace”) and pays off in the final aerial tableau—waiver applies. Cost is on-page: perpetual exile for the father, lifelong sentinel distance for the daughter. No lens ambiguity; the persistent constraint (one uncrossable strip) shapes both tactics and final image, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terrace, maze, and levitating house are sketched with sensory economy—“cornfields looked like fingerprints”—and the recurring object (grain-carved furniture) literally steers plot, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: drift altitude, balcony vantage, strip of soil width all track. Weather is woven into both atmosphere and mechanics (logbook codes, rain scent). No world-rule inconsistency; the surreal physics are taught early and obeyed. Micro-setting (chair/table distance) becomes the portal device, charging the final image. However, brief atmospheric listlets (“slow hexagons, prismatic sheets”) slightly stall momentum mid-paragraph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintain cosmic distance to keep town/terrace safe—is signaled early and tightened through each furniture experiment. The seventh-day chair slide is the decisive reversal that swaps observation for physical risk. Agency remains with the protagonist: her decoding triggers every escalation; coincidence is absent. Cost is repeatedly legible (terraced lurch, olfactory rain, final exile-in-place). Escalation could sharpen one notch deeper had the maze punished an earlier trespass, but the single meaningful tightening meets scope default and lands under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—sacred separation as cosmic duty—emerges through grain, maze, and renunciation, never sermonized. The necessary-distance motif reweights from furniture rule to filial chasm, culminating in the image of eternal non-touch. Subtext runs in silence and soil strip rather than exposition. Insight is earned through tactile ordeal, not abstract assertion, offering lingering ambiguity about love versus equilibrium. Final paragraph avoids thematic echo; resonance is imagistic. Complex without tidy moral, though slightly undercut by father’s didactic mini-lecture (“some thresholds must remain open but uncrossed”), a hairline thematic drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is lyrically compressed yet coherent—“featherly determined,” “fractured hush”—with rhythmic control that mirrors aerial drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: narrator reads weather in wood grain, navigates by shadow, hears leaves as pre-broken syllables. No head-hopping; POV obeys knowledge bounds (father’s thinness inferred, not explained). Experimental diction (“slow hexagons,” “prism terrace”) is pattern-taught in first paragraph and paid off in final lens flash. Syntax modulates: short clauses under tilt-entry, longer coils in reflective beats. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext and stakes. Registers remain within a rural-surreal idiom; no committee voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly compressed, most sentences doing double duty (image + causality), with strong read-aloud cadence and varied openings. Mixed-metaphor risk is present (“sunlight… sheets,” “clouds… hexagons”) but coheres inside the prism conceit; no vehicles violate internal physics. Occasional near-loop—“distances folding and unfolding inside green walls”—is offset by new information. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“peeling,” “tilted,” “shimmered”) drive motion. One paraphrase loop: “fractured hush” thrice; yet its repetition becomes incantatory, pattern-earned. Copy is clean; no typos. Final line cadence lands with resonant throb. Artifacts do not obscure closure; density stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses cosmic-shift small-town surrealism with carpentry-cipher mystery; the notion of weather codes engraved in furniture grain feels genuinely fresh. Image system (terrace, prism, fingerprints, grain, hush) is internally generative, not decorative checklist. Familiar trope—vanishing parent—transmuted via necessary-distance physics and filial cartography. Final renunciation avoids sentimental reconciliation, choosing abstract equilibrium over catharsis, a bold narrative risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity passes transformation test: swap prism/wood-cipher and the whole arc collapses. Risk distinction +0.3 within band.</comment>
