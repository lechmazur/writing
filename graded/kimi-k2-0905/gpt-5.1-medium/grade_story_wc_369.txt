<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Milo’s quiet, attuned interiority—listening to the labyrinth breathe, choosing to carry the sextant, watering the trees—builds a hierarchy of values where attention itself becomes risk. The final ledger entry is a micro-choice that crystallizes his endurance and forecloses return to sweeping anonymity; cost is the lifelong burden of witnesseship. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. wonder) hum under every beat without overt epiphany. Voice stays lone and occupational detail stays germane; no relationship crucible is required here.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant’s re-calibration to trees reframes “quantified sorrow” as legible forgiveness, felt when dawn light hits the open ledger. Accumulative/texture lens holds from first hollow tower inhale to final rooftop hum; sorrow-density accumulates, then reweights meaning. Causality is internal—because Milo listened, therefore he sees—and the price is permanent attention he can neither renounce nor share. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 50.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tower, rooftop garden, and sextant-as-micro-setting constrain every move: only Milo’s skeleton keys and drainage cisterns grant access, and only moonlight on the ledge revives the brass. Storm and moonlight are not backdrop but tools—rain codes messages, moonlight heals metal. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his climb up the hidden stair and the exact pot where moonlight pools. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through maintenance priorities: sound of leaks before thunder, feel of brass temperature before visual gleam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Milo accept the maze’s invitation to witness?—is signaled when the corridor inhales. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped dream tightens the noose of knowledge until the ledger becomes the only possible exhale. No external antagonist; pressure is the growing density of witnessed sorrow. Cost is visible—he forfeits anonymous sweeping for lifelong bookkeeping of grief—and forecloses return to innocence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: attention itself is a form of repair. Subtext operates in gestures—watering trees, aligning brass—rather than declarations. Final image of “sorrow bent quietly toward forgiveness” is earned through concrete particulars, not moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: ledger totals can never balance, yet the act of measuring is itself grace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is maintenance-worker precise: “gravel from the tiles,” “wet tick of condensation,” “overflow flung spray.” Syntax lengthens during wonder, compresses during climb, mirroring metabolic state. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction staying within Milo’s plausible lexicon—“smudged ledger,” “cleaning cisterns”—without drift into academic register. Filter verbs are voice-motivated: “he understood” is the only way a taciturn worker could articulate seismic shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “water bled through the stone joints, lightning mapped the sky, and every leaking echo told him where the maze was tired” delivers setting, atmosphere, and character knowledge in one breath. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as code, moon as milk—and never stack into purple. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new information or pressure. Rhythm accelerates during corridor inhale, then breathes longer at rooftop, mirroring heart-rate shift without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—magical object, sentient building, lonely caretaker—are inverted by treating maintenance as metaphysics. Sextant that measures sorrow rather than stars feels inevitable once we learn trees record human passage. Risk is structural: lyric accumulation could have collapsed into soft mysticism, yet sorrow stays quantified and ledger stays ink-stained. Final image of “bent quietly toward forgiveness” is non-obvious synthesis of quantification and grace, earned rather than imposed.</comment>
