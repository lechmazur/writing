<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marla’s involuntary honesty is dramatized in every beat: the reflexive confession “I am involuntarily truthful,” the throat-tightening moment before she must speak the city awake, the envy of liars. The boy’s presence forces a visible hierarchy of values—truth vs wonder—and her final utterance costs her the safety of silence. Interior contradiction is live: duty to report wars with the quieter wish to “preserve wonder,” and both impulses act simultaneously under the booth’s failing light. The arc lands in credible endurance: she keeps collecting “a small secret toll,” a renunciation that forecloses pure honesty and accepts ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marla’s spoken condition—“only if it remembers to be astonished”—reweights the city’s power-grid rules and ignites the tower, visible cost on the page. Causal chain holds: because she cannot lie, the boy seeks her; because she speaks, the hive reboots; because she accepts perpetual secrecy, the bridge reopens under her private tariff. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (toll booth, post-blackout night, boy approaching). No lens ambiguity; the story tracks “because/therefore” under causal drive to the final flare.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice: the glass booth’s failing light limits visibility; the matchbox’s size dictates how the riddle is delivered; the lightning tower’s pulse supplies the only usable energy. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—orange glow on lacquer, rasp of cardboard, wind carrying “rumors of drone beehive failure.” Spatial choreography is clean: boy stops outside the light-cone, tower axis aligns with bridge. The lacquer box recurs, reweighted from forgotten curio to vault of the new secret toll, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether wonder can survive routine—tightens when Marla realizes the blackout is sabotage meant to force awe. Agency centers on her irreversible speech act: saying the city is “worth waking” reboots the grid and binds her to lifelong secrecy. Cost is immediate: she trades absolute honesty for custodianship of astonishment. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves the conflict—the reboot is contingent on her truthful endorsement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: drones as bees, lightning as nectar, toll as wonder-tax. No character moralizes; the final image of the matchbox inside the lacquer box reconfigures meaning—truth itself becomes a private toll. Ambiguity lingers: the city may forget again, Marla may grow bitter, the tower may fail. The reader is left weighing wonder against surveillance without authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Marla’s perceptual signature: “nectar dusk,” “coins falling like coins,” envy of liars. Syntax lengthens under hesitation, then snaps short at the climactic utterance. No head-hopping; boy’s motives surface only through Marla’s interpretations. Voice modulation tracks pressure: lyrical density in static moments, clipped fragments as the tower flares.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the tiny rasp loud as a spark,” “words falling like coins in a steel tray.” Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent—lightning as drink, drones as bees, truth as toll. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with beats: long sentence for dusk thickness, staccato for hive ignition. One filter-verb cluster (“she told herself”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses climate-tech fable with mythic honesty curse; the blackout-as-lesson feels fresh, not didactic. Specificity anchors novelty: “data-cleaning pigeons that no longer came,” “steel flowers.” The final reconfiguration—truthkeeper as wonder-guardian—grows inevitably from earlier seeds. Risk in lyrical compression pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
