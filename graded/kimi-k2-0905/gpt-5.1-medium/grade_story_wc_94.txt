<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poet’s interiority is vivid—throat-space where “public language used to live” embodied, contradictory. Micro-choice to look through telescope earns cost: sky’s grief becomes his. No secondary pressure from astronomer beyond facilitator, so relationship crucible underused. Closure renunciation legible, price felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of bruise/ionospheric scars intensifies toward Charged Poise. Timer wound at start → narrowing hour → final auroral map: cadence shift reweights silence as measurable phenomenon. Closure image (“air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth”) crystallizes options with conceptual cost. No causality gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory dome, brass handle, copper fittings—each tactile object constrains movement and focal length. Stormlit slit channels lightning into telescope barrel, charging final image. Micro-setting of poet’s erased throat parallels macro ionosphere. Setting evolution tied to knowledge gain; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Stakes: can poet bear witness to collective erasure without re-inscribing it? Escalation via timer clicks and storm thickening rarefies air—felt price. One-hour clock forecloses intervention, forces attention. Agency is attention itself; cost is irreversible knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal: censorship not absence but atmospheric bruise visible to science. Final image equates rarefied air with cleared vision—conceptual repricing of silence as pressure. No moralizing; resonance via ionospheric map. Theme inextricable from poet’s arc: surviving erasure by seeing it quantified.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at poet’s perceptual edge: “wind read its own unruly poem.” Syntax lengthens then compresses under timer discipline. Free indirect cleanly braided with sensory filter. Distinct diction—“isobars on the soul,” “cartography of scars”—anchors voice without strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rhythm mirrors rarefaction: clauses thin as air pressure drops. Metaphors sustained (storm as poem, bruise as history) without muddle. No scaffold, no synonym loops. Final line delivers charged image without overwriting. High information density: every sentence layers meteorology & metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ionospheric record of censorship as auroral scar is non-obvious synthesis of science & silenced art. Risk: lyric telescope trained on invisible political weather pays off. Cannot swap poet for any exile—only poet’s banned syllables spike detectors. Conceptual integrity sustained; no retreat into generic dystopia.</comment>
