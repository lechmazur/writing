<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s grief-as-tuning-fork is vivid, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the contradictions of “mournfully eager” are lived in each pull-cord gesture. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation (letting the engines die while laughter leaks upstairs) is earned by the prior sonic labor. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; headcount stays coherent. Cap invoked: closure not touched, but 9+ gate requires 8.8+ here, and the slight emotional ventriloquism of “he understands” summary just below final beat keeps it at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf-blower roar → phantom laughter → parental bark/giggle reweights the silence; Lysander’s Charged Poise at “pull cord handle hangs warm” shows cost without tidy resolution. Causal chain holds: because he dials engines to stall, therefore harmonic memory macerates, therefore upstairs laughter cracks open. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“tunnel under the old house” + time marker). No lens ambiguity; accumulation pattern taught early and paid off. Meets 9+ quick test with persistent constraint (the tunnel’s acoustic price) shaping final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo-tunnel as micro-setting constrains every tactic: the roar can only escape via nail holes, vents, mouse runs—this directly enables the laughter resurrection. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lysander’s sound-engineer ear: auditory > tactile > smell (cut-grass/shampoo draft). Spatial choreography is clean—crescent of blowers, snouts toward brick, distance tracked. Tool-as-setting (pull-cord) charges final image. Minor slip: visual overused in “bruised resonance shaking mildew” but image is brief and serves pressure. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—signaled in line 1 and tightens when engines hover on stall edge; one meaningful deepening occurs as phantom laughter threads upstairs, forcing parental rupture. Agency is renunciation/attention: Lysander lets engines die, enduring unknown aftermath; this forecloses his control over what returns. Cost is audible: the house’s silence is irreversibly cracked; parents’ laugh is “rusted but unmistakable.” Under Accumulative lens, density increase (roar → memory → draft → bark) reweights stake. Meets 9+ quick test: price is legible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief’s sound-engineering as tender vandalism of silence. Subtext in the unspoken jokes sliding like dandelion seeds avoids overt thesis. Final image reweights “tending to the unspoken” from caretaking to acoustic break-in. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers—laughter is restored but rusted, not healed. Minor echo: “endings are the only honest beginnings” flirts with aphorism but is filtered through Lysander’s idiosyncratic rationale, so penalty waived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-distance stays stable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is sound-obsessed, metallic, domestic-handyman diction: “plastic casings knock,” “snouts toward the bare brick.” Syntax lengthens under emotional surge then fragments at peak (“He half sings… voice cracking”). Rhythm mirrors motor rev/fall. No filter-verb stacks; “he understands” is sole minor intrusion but occurs post-closure and reads as earned summarization. Meets 9+ quick test: distinct texture taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable: “macerates it against stone and moisture” does two jobs (verb + tactile). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Mixed metaphor check: “bruised resonance” is brief and acoustically coherent. Register remains in groundskeeper lexicon. Final line “air holds the shape of a smile” is precise, not purple. One template cadence (“He pulls each cord in turn…”) is purposeful, taught early, so waived. Meets 9+ quick test: zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—leaf-blower séance to resurrect laughter—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Acoustic haunting via household power-tool is fresh synthesis of grief-tech. Risky second-person-style address to “you” never appears; instead, lyric accumulation makes silence itself a character. Specificity: egg-timer rust cough, dandelion-seed jokes, shampoo-scented draft. Transformation test fails if Lysander renamed—ritual is inseparable from his occupational ear. Bonus +0.3 for risk that heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
