<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “quiet authority of tides” moment crystallizes contradictory impulses—but the crowd remains typed (woman in red = exit-scanner, fisherman = jaw-tight patterner). The bishop transfer is a clean micro-choice, yet no visible cost attaches to him; the risk is off-loaded onto the woman. Earned Stasis is hinted but not dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop’s diagonal cut reconfigures the crowd’s perceived options with undeniable conceptual cost (“new moves became visible”). Causal chain—tide timetable → coin choices → bishop plant—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One persistent constraint (tide’s return) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tidal arcade is not postcard scenery: water depth dictates suitcase placement, moon grids guide footwork, brine mist corrodes neon to flicker-rate the teenagers’ syncopated attention. Micro-setting (bishop’s cold bone) becomes the decision pivot. Only the gull shriek feels surplus; every other sensory pick feeds POV bias or choice constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“serenade monotony into new rhythm”—tightens when the bishop implant forces the crowd to confront slantwise agency. Escalation is accumulative: each micro-read (left-side favor, jaw tighten, beat-lean) increases density until the object transfer detonates the pattern. Cost is legible in the hush that follows, options reweighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: control through surrender—ordering randomness tunes rather than kills chance. No moralizing; the final image of “tilted board” reweights prior coin flips and tide metrics. Ambiguity lingers: is Marcus guru or charlatan? The bishop’s diagonal cut supplies non-literal answer without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Marcus’s perceptual radius: synesthetic (“vending-machine constellations”), probabilistic (“invisible grid”), tidal. Syntax lengthens then fractures—“like tightening strings before music”—mirroring rising stakes. No head-hop; crowd’s interior is inferred solely through micro-movements, keeping distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: tidal clauses swell, then clipped coin beats. Information density high—one sentence often sets scene, reveals tactic, signals metaphor. No loops or scaffold. Only minor purple haze: “seashell pressed to the cosmos” could lose “pressed” without loss. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Magic-realist busker noir feels fresh; the chance-illusion mechanic is grounded in tactile sleight rather than genre hand-wave. Risk: tide-as-metronome could read gimmick, but tide’s physical erosion of circuitry keeps it material. Synthesis—chess geometry + tidal clock—creates non-obvious stakes that survive the swap test.</comment>
