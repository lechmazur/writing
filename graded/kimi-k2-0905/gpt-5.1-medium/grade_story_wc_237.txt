<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lan’s interiority is concrete—“his thoughts…crystallized”—and the birthmark shard shows embodied shame in action. The final rune-acts are micro-choices that visibly cost trembling fingers and a literal scribed scar of light, earning the shift from hiding to bearing marks. Competence is balanced with struggle: he kneels, shakes, exhales. No contradictory impulses play simultaneously on-page, and the master remains a distant cipher, so relationship crucible is unused; hence held sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the platform descends while Lan cradles the cup-inkwell, his luminous scars now story-margins, cost felt in “waiting tempests.” Causal linkage holds—each rune is birthed from a dramatized memory under master’s rule that superstition husks must be shed. No orientation debt; anchoring (who/where) delivered by sentence 3. One lens throughout: Causal, focused because/therefore of memory → rune → visible light scar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating tea-platform, storm below, and flickering talismans constrain every motion; a single gust could doom them, so environment shapes tactics. Steam, rock, and cup recur as handled objects that carry final image. Sensory economy is tight—“saturated hush,” “motes of tea steam”—yet tactile (porcelain chips, tether chains). Detail never stalls beats; it is woven into rune drawing and bodily tension. Micro-setting qualifies and charges closure, but not quite a 9-level indispensable constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into living stories—signals early and tightens through two escalating rune beats that foreclose the option of lifelong shame. Cost is visible: trembling hand, bright scar, and impending storm that will test the new runes. Agency is Lan’s quill-strokes; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices; lacks a second visible price or persistent rule-change, keeping it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: shame-scars become deliberate glyphs, ending image reweights birthmark from curse to compass without moralizing. Subtext in steam-glyphs and storm-circling implies future tests greater than this ceremony. No thematic echo or final statement; ambiguity lingers. Final cup-as-inkwell reprises earlier tea-leaf dragons, shifting meaning from fear to authorship. Complexity accepted; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays firmly inside Lan’s perceptual filter: he notices steam patterns, talisman flicker, thunder proximity, never the master’s thoughts. Syntax warps under stress—compressed clauses, occasional fragment (“Again.”)—mirrors crystalline thought. Diction is poetic yet within apprentice scholar lexicon: “ink dragons,” “glyphs,” “scribe.” No dialogue to distort; crow-quill action replaces speech. Distinct rhythmic signature and consistent psychic distance earn near-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “robes pooled like ink” does triple duty—visual, status, foreshadowing ink function. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (steam ≠ contradictory vehicles). Rhythm modulates—long sentence for kettle arc, fragment for “Again.” Paraphrase absent; each line advances image or pressure. Tiny loop risk: “storm” repeated three times in closing paragraph, but serves looming escalation, not artifact. Read-aloud cadence supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy rune-ceremony trope is refreshed by inversion: power comes not from banishing superstition but from shedding its husk to reveal living core. Image of tea-leaves as ink dragons and floating rock as literal examination room is specific, not generic. Synthesis of shame-scars + calligraphy feels inevitable after first shard. Risk taken—lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist—but coherence holds. No echoes of famous scenes; voice is singular.</comment>
