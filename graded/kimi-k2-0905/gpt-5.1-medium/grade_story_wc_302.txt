<comment>The veiled dreamer’s contradictory hunger for discovery yet fear of finality is embodied in micro-choices—testing coughs, pacing silence, finally dissolving her resignation letter—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“ink felt like dragging chains across the carpet of the air”). The only bar to 9 is that the second-letter reversal is single-sentence shorthand; we feel relief but not the full cost of abandoning her old life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she abandons documentation itself, reweighting the premise that knowledge must be fixed. Causal chain holds—each silence-test → shelf-shift → map of absence → renunciation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The “cyclically reversed” watch and mist-gate rules stay consistent; orientation anchors within 120 words. Cost is legible: her Institute resignation literally evaporates, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>River fog, lantern-books, and the watch’s pale gold are filtered through her cartographer’s eye, constraining her method (she maps silence, not ink). Micro-setting—her inner pocket, the blank card—charges the final act. Spatial choreography is clean: gate, aisles, alcoves track without drift. One hairline slip from 9: the city’s geography beyond the embankment is hazy, though this barely blunts the mist-bound immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she fix or free the unspoken?”—tightens when silence-lag becomes the new metric and documentation is foreclosed. One meaningful deepening: realizing restraint can be mercy, not cowardice. Cost is visible (letter destroyed, career path gone), but the external world offers no tangible backlash yet, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of leaving certain knowledge unmapped. Subtext lives in gesture—dissolving ink mid-air enacts the idea. Final single-sentence card offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, cartographic precision; perceptual signature is strong (“sketching a glowing library in mist along the embankment like a lantern carried by the world”). Syntax breathes longer in wonder, shortens under choice. Velvet-coat man’s diction stays slightly performative, distinct from her restrained cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with discovery vs. decision; sentences carry double duty (description + rule). One paraphrase loop (“nothing spoken may enter, and nothing written may leave” echoed immediately after) and a single mixed metaphor (“carpet of the air”) keep it from 9. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Library of unspoken words” risks trope, but the silence-mapping protocol and reversed-time watch feel fresh. Conceptual pivot—renouncing documentation itself—flips the expected explorer arc. Specificity of cartographic training lends lived authenticity. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
