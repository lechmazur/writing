<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior overflow vs. cataloguing competence is concrete; the mirror-orchard beat forces a micro-choice that accepts nonlinear inheritance with visible cost—his own signature fruit. The blank pistachio cameo acts as an embodied blind spot, tying flaw to action. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent by scope. Endurance of paradox is earned, foreclosing linear safety; cost is felt in the final step through the mirror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s crossing reweights inheritance rules and imposes sideways accountability. Causal linkage holds: annotation-cluster pressure → glowing shell → mirror fruit → step through; each beat narrows option toward acceptance. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“lonely asteroid”), well inside safe window. One shard only, no transition; length fits 600–800 default; cost legible in the final image of carrying future-fruit and bathroom memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Astral orchard functions as micro-setting that actively buds answers and bears fruit-names; it constrains the final choice by offering only sideways trade, not exit. Vacuum, starless dark, and condensation drip provide sensory triangulation without checklist churn. Scale is disciplined: whole museum introduced in one sentence, then zooms to fingernail-sized shell. Spatial choreography clean—mirror stall geography tracks as branches grow from toilet tank.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“who inherits a story?”—signalled early via margin-questions; pressure tightens when Elias’s own signature appears on fruit, forcing either acceptance or erasure of future bargain. Escalation is accumulative: each new annotation adds density, each fruit narrows option until mirror-crossing becomes unavoidable. Price visible on page: he physically carries the future-fruit and bathroom memory, foreclosing linear life. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally from image pattern—blank shell, unsigned fruit, mirror blank-face—posing inheritance as reader-to-character rather than parent-to-child. No final moral stated; last image of carrying future-fruit reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext carried in gesture: shell’s emptiness “louder than emperors” implies value of unmarked potential. Wisdom is earned through specific struggle in orchard-mirror sequence, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person sustained, no head-hopping; perceptual signature is curator-cataloguer (“pressing seeds between transparent plates,” “label floating”). Syntax elongates to mimic shelf-overflow, then fragments under mirror pressure—“cool glass…not air at all.” Diction stays within lexicon of archivist—annotation, catalog, velvet cavity—without academic drift. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone and passes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density: single sentences perform world-build, sensory cue, and metaphor (“apples were miniature suns; from others, closed eyes”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; rhythm accelerates into mirror paragraph without scaffold. Figurative logic consistent—fruit-pages thin as pistachio skins—no mixed-metaphor muddle. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he suspected”) and do not cluster in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: museum = orchard = book, with curator as inheritor而非descendant transforms familiar space-station trope into sideways-time negotiation. Pistachio shell as cameo-blank is idiosyncratic anchor, not quirky ornament—it reweights at closure. Risk of philosophical bathroom epiphany is embraced, justified by recurrent motif and payoff in mirror scene. Concept commits fully: no retreat to linear safety; inheritance law rewritten in-image.</comment>
