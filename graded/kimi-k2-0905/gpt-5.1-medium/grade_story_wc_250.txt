<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dentist’s regret is embodied in the mirror’s trembling light on his certificates; the guardian’s calm is shown through water-circles that re-weight lamplight. Both characters act under pressure: the guardian teaches stars, the dentist dials the woman. Interior contradiction is present—fear vs. need—but the guardian’s “spiralingly calm” is asserted more than dramatized, muting micro-choice visibility. Cost is felt yet not sharpened to tooth-edge; the apology lands but the woman’s response is off-page, softening the bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shutters stay open, the dock keeps its cobalt gleam, and the guardian walks on—earned stasis with visible cost (constellations fade). Causality holds: mirror-beam → water-stars → shutter code → phone call, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation is anchored early (“cobalt dock after rain”), no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-weaving tightens emotional stakes rather than external options; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, bruised-glass canal, and wet-plank constellations are rendered through selective sensory detail that constrains tactics: the guardian must use water-surface as canvas, the dentist must angle mirror off damp wood. Micro-setting (mirror, shutter slats, lamplight on certificates) functions as environment that alters choices. Spatial choreography is clean: guardian’s hand → ripples → plank glints → upward to window. No static postcarding; each descriptor is filtered through POV urgency and returned in the final fade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can regret be spoken before it petrifies? Pressure tightens once: hesitant shutter tics → deliberate mirror signals → phone lifted. Cost is visible—constellations fade, guardian’s knees protest—yet the woman’s off-page voice keeps the price partially abstract. Agency is present but shared across two POVs; escalation is textural (density of light-signals) rather than causal narrowing. Enough for 8-band, but not the sharper foreclosure needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: silence can be broken if darkness is taught to see its own stars. Subtext carries in gesture—shutter rhythms, water-rings—never sermonized. Final image reweights premise: open shutters + fading stars = apology voiced without guarantee. Complexity is honored: guardian keeps walking, night not banished. No moral tag; resonance arises from particulars. Thematic echo “teach darkness the value of stars” is embedded in action, not final-paragraph statement, preserving subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, tidal cadence; perceptual signature leans toward synesthetic light-weaving. Register stays within poetic diction without corporate drift. Filter verbs are minimal; water, mirror, and shutters act. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Psychic distance stable; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“stillwater tension”) and paid off in final fade. One hairline slip: “spiralingly calm” reads coined rather than embodied, a micro-register lift outside canal-idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses with varied rhythm; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—water, teeth, stars—taught by 25% mark and justified at closure. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors absent; bruised glass, half-spoken secret, cobalt dock cohere. One near-overwrite: “trembling constellations that clung to wet boards” pushes toward purple, but the cling is physically true and echoes emotional clinging, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—canal guardian as empathetic listener who literally writes star-lessons on water—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swap guardian for human friend and the light-weave vanishes, breaking the story. Risk taken in lyric accumulation rather than causal duel; payoff is resonant reconfiguration not twist. Avoids quirky ornament: every image (mirror-moons, shutter-codes) is functional. Slight proximity to magical-helper trope is offset by guardian’s own cost (aching knees, fading stars).</comment>
