<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The visionary’s root-bound paralysis is viscerally embodied; the fused scars throb with each choice, and the final shared vision costs blood and agency. Lio’s skeptical curiosity is credibly shaken, but his interior arc is slightly under-drafted—his shift from “show me” to “we cannot cut or keep” feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices. Still, the mutual flaw—neither can act without the other’s wound—creates a crucible that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the joint vision reconfigures options and the refusal to choose is paid for by the glowing scars and the maze’s uncontrollable sprawl. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative density of images culminates in a situational impasse. Orientation is clean by line 5; the glade, dusk, and root-bound ankles anchor instantly. One minor slack: the line “the covenant is thinning” arrives without prior textual seed, but the final image retroactively weights it, so the deduction is minimal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt glade is no backdrop; the dusk light, root harness, and trembling clipping constrict every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—vision narrows to eclipse-lit veins of the maze, tactile pain eclipses sound. The clipping’s single unfurling leaf becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or sever the dreaming maze—tightens once: the shared vision reveals both choices unleash unpayable costs. Agency is split: the visionary cannot walk, the skeptic cannot measure, so their mutual scar-link becomes the decisive yet paralyzing act. Price is legible in glowing blood and the maze’s sea-sized future; escalation is complete at the beat of refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of governing time’s overgrowth; the eclipse-covenant is never exposited, only enacted through fused flesh and branching hedges. Subtextual tension: faith vs. evidence collapse into one shared nightmare whose only moral is continued uncertainty. Final image—two shadows overlapping like an eternal eclipse—reweights every prior mention of light and soil without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “roots braided around my ankles,” “light rushed up through borrowed tomorrows.” Syntax mirrors entanglement—long enjambed sentences tighten into fragment bursts under vision stress. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is root-bound, synesthetic, and unapologetically mythic. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“We cannot cut or keep it” is both surrender and prophecy).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: every image does double duty (setting + body, metaphor + causality). One clause drifts toward purple: “tide of borrowed tomorrows” risks stacking metaphors, but the next sentence grounds it in the shared vision’s physical toll, so momentum recovers. No loops, no scaffold, high density; final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-gothic with chrono-horror; the maze that dreams itself wider feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk—root-bound paralysis as literal travel method—pays off by forcing the climax into shared flesh rather than action. Specificity of the eclipse-clipping that grows only under failed sunlight transforms a gimmick into cosmology. The refusal-ending avoids both triumph and nihilism, achieving rare resonance.</comment>
