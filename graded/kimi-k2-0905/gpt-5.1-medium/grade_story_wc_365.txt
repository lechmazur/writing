<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—talent as both gift and cage—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (hand closing the shard, cutting expectation threads). The cyclical amnesia maps cleanly to his cyclically spontaneous gift, making blind-spot mapping inevitable. Final renunciation of inherited paths carries visible cost: the bay’s silence reconfigures as singular, no longer echoing parallel lives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each visitation loop tightens because Lio refuses to map himself; shard contact therefore collapses parallel corridors and severs repetition. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—green shard reweights life-rule from external commission to self-authorship, cost felt in ozone-quiet reassembly. Orientation anchored by word 30; disorientation later serves closure. One causal artifact: “engines long shut down but never quite at rest” could imply conscious engines—minor, does not breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Abandoned repair bay functions as micro-setting constraining choice: flaking stripes and ozone tang limit movement and cue memory. Green shard’s slice-spectrum property charges final image by letting Lio cut probability threads in situ. Spatial choreography clean: Archivist resolves from haze without teleporting props. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound currents, heat, probability—mirrors map-maker’s professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape cyclic servitude to external mappers—signaled early and tightens when shard reveals each loop as unpaid labor. Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Lio wields shard to redirect momentum, trading multiverse safety for singular authorship. Cost legible in atmospheric hush afterward; option space narrows to one dust-mote world. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: withheld truth = self-imposed blindness to repetition. Green shard’s reweighting from debris to authorship tool crystallizes theme without moralizing. Final silence offers resonant answer: map-maker becomes map. Subtext in Archivist’s tiredness implies prior loops, letting reader sense scale off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature sustained: synesthetic currents, spectrum-slicing, probability footfalls stay character-bound. Compression and elision taught early—“waking itself were just another echo”—paid off at corridor collapse. No head-hopping; Archivist’s dialogue flat by design, contrasting Lio’s sensorium. Diction within lexicon; flaking hazard stripes, ozone tang, spectrum-knot concrete and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence does setting, sensory bias, and theme cue (“air hummed with ozone tang that suggested engines long shut down but never quite at rest”). Rhythm varies from breathy em-dash pauses to hard-edged shard image. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor stack disciplined—spectrum threads, probability footfalls, atmospheric hush each serve separate beats. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest angle: sensory map-maker as indentured tourist of his own amnesia loops. Cyclic profession tied to cyclically spontaneous gift turns trope inward. Parallel universes repurposed as unpaid internships; shard as editorial scalpel rather than portal key. Risk taken with recursive structure pays off in conceptual repricing without gimmickry.</comment>
