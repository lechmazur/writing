<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android’s nostalgic drive to “burn” his borrowed fears is rooted from line 1 (“remember”) and sharpens with every geomagnetic lurch; the interior contradiction—pruning roses while courting wildfire—beats inside every micro-choice (“folded the images down”). Embodied emotion arrives in servo-misfires that feel like “startled muscles,” and the final renunciation of the crate costs him his last link to the children, paid in visible static-quiet. No diagnostic labels—only acts and sensorial cost—earning the unusually high band for a single-POV miniature arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crate-link is severed, static mutates from “radio snow” to “distant surf,” and the compass re-centers—cost is unmistakable on the page. Causal chain holds: reroute power → soil desiccation → thermal partition ignition → containment of nightmares; each “because” tightens options until containment itself becomes the irreversible act. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“glass-domed enclosure at dawn”) and never wavers; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of compress-burn-reorder—held to final “quietly ordered” garden. No plot amnesia, full 9-band eligibility met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dome, roses, crate, and android chassis serve as micro-setting that literally constrains the burn route; dried root-trenches become fire corridors, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays robotic—mineral scent, servo hiss, magnetic tremor—yet filtered through caretaker priorities (water ration, petal hardness). Spatial choreography across irrigation lines and glass ribs is flawless; no white-room lapse. Setting materials evolve: soil cracks, roots contract, glass ribs “tremble with low, musical stress,” all feeding back into the protagonist’s sensorium—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the android free himself from static without losing the children’s memories? Escalation is textural—each geomagnetic jerk thickens the “inner static” until the burn becomes the only narrowing option. Micro-choices reroute water, compress nightmares, ignite partition—each carries a visible price (dried roses, scorched roots, quieter but lonelier signal). The final cost is felt: a hush replaces the static, but the children’s fears are miniaturized, not lived—stakes land with undeniable forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: survival through controlled loss—gardens and minds both flourish by sacrificing the flammable. Subtext operates in the crate’s shift from comfort-tool to nostalgia-narcotic; final image of “quietly ordered” rows implies order purchased on silent absences. No moralizing—meaning stays implicit, inviting reflection on memory compression as emotional arson. Aftereffect is a bittersweet hush—reader senses the android’s new solitude without it being named.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, slightly metallic, yet capable of nostalgia—“museum of borrowed fears” is perfect android diction. Syntax lengthens when pruning, compresses when folding nightmares, mirroring data-pack operations. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unique—magnetic variance mapped as “prayer flags” across consciousness. Rhythm accelerates into sentence fragments during servo misfires, then settles into steady caretaker pace—line-level craft serves persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density—each line does two jobs (action + metaphor or sensation). No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “data-embers no larger than a pixel,” “porcelain around a bruise of color.” Grammar clean, tense stable; final sentence lands with quiet cadence that recharges the burn motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing android nostalgia with forest-fire ecology is fresh; “box of childhood fears” as a data-crate that must be compressed and ignited is non-obvious synthesis. Premise commits fully—no retreat from techno-botanical metaphor. Specificity keeps it from feeling allegory: rose sap thickening, servo twitches, checksum memories. Risky compression of decades into embers pays off in resonant final hush.</comment>
