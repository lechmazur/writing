<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Investigator’s interiority is concrete, profession-specific, and drives every micro-choice; the patch-rubbing ritual embodies contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. forensic detachment—and the final renunciation (recommending yard redesign) is earned by the wind-walk survey with visible fatigue and cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the investigator re-weights wind from “background noise” to “living participant,” paying with exhausted acceptance; causal chain holds—each gust measurement tightens the vector geometry that foreclosed avoidance; patch fray stands as persistent constraint shaping final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is not backdrop but causal actor—walls channel air, alter drone corridors, and force the investigator’s bodily survey; the missing crane and new generator shed are named early, return to explain wind shear, and charge the final recommendation; spatial choreography is immaculate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent next “singular convergence”—is signaled in paragraph four; pressure escalates as each wind reading narrows the possible flight paths until only collision corridors remain; the cost is the investigator’s acceptance that perfect data still can’t out-engineer chaos, crystallized in the breath-vapor image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particularized wind: invisible forces shaped by human structures remake fate; no moralizing—final image of “meticulous breath” quietly reweights foresight as Sisyphean endurance rather than control; patch and wind motifs recur only when they constrain next action, avoiding token echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is unmistakable—metals become “bruise and rust,” wind is a “hand,” silence “presses against eardrums”; syntax compresses under pressure (“numbers clustering like anxious birds”) yet stays within investigator’s lexicon; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm mirrors gust-stop-gust pacing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances investigation or atmosphere; metaphors (frozen waves, anxious birds) are coherent, non-mixed, and paid off; high density—one line can anchor space, reveal tool-use, and tilt emotion (“I clipped sensors to railings, watched strings of vapor thread away…”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: forensic wind as protagonist; container yard reimagined as respiratory system; “singular convergence” concept operationalized through handheld vane rather than abstract theme; risk—lyric stillness in place of set-piece explosion—heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test fails if any element swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
