<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The folklorist’s curiosity and the cost it exacts stay vivid, but the final beat leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“this was simply what happened when habits break”) rather than a dramatized micro-choice that seals the bargain; the interiority is otherwise embodied and the amnesiac grief feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every return of memory is earned by kneeling in the fungal ring, and the tide’s re-entry makes the cost—continuing memory-loss—undeniable. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator climbs out owning an incomplete but authentically his story, with the constraint that curiosity now permanently erodes other facts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The drowned cathedral of glass and salt water is handled as tool, not backdrop: the broken panes literally pattern the star-map that drives the climax. Ship-wreck masts slice “shards of trembling night,” constraining where the narrator can step and where the reflected constellations fall, so environment shapes tactics and charges the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering selfhood—tightens when each mushroom-bead of memory returned costs a fresh fact dissolving. Protagonist agency drives every gain and loss; coincidence merely frames, never resolves. The price is legible on the page: phone numbers slip away before the climb-out, foreclosing the “tidy life” option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: the price of knowing is forgetting, the peril and pulse of a life ordered by story-hunger. Final image—tide creeping over the ring—reweights earlier orchard experiments into a covenant that can’t be renounced, only embraced at perpetual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person texture is consistent: “wind-humming panes,” “rope burn ache,” “needle jumping from a cracked record” are idiosyncratic, not borrowed lyric. Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses when memories lurch back—without filter-verb clutter; voice never spills into meta-explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for tide mirror calm, clipped fragments for each returning bead of memory. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse enough that “drowned cathedral” lands clean. High density—each sentence layers glass, stars, salt, silt—without cluttering the climb-out beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring-as-memory-portal could feel familiar, yet the graft onto folkloric field notes, star maps, and a greenhouse shipwreck creates a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric amnesia structure pays off because causality stays visible; the trope is transformed through specific coastal erosion science and the apple-graft metaphors of hybrid knowledge.</comment>
