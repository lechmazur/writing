<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Darius’s interior contradiction—philosopher vs duelist, repairer vs manipulator—surfaces in micro-choices: shifting the sundial, unsheathing the rapier, reopening the tin. The mechanical arm’s click keeps time as a bodily cost, anchoring motive in every lunge. The final invitation to “decide where your questions wish to go” crystallizes his earned stance: cartographer of hesitation, not miracle worker. Missing only a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but single-POV depth holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sundial’s redirected beam, the drawn blade, and the tin’s exposed spiral reconfigure the atrium into a dueling ground where tomorrow’s ownership will be routed, not debated. Causal chain—lateness → reopen tin → notice spiral → angle sundial → invite duel—tightens options with visible cost: Darius risks his neutral-repairer identity. Lens is Causal; every because/therefore linkage narrows possibility up to the final image. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass panes, fractured paint, broken sundial rays, and the brook’s murmur filter through Darius’s bias for angles and time-slices. The atrium’s reflective floor and fern-shadows literally guide where he places feet and tempers, turning setting into tactical map. The tin’s spiral constellation and the half-painted dial are micro-settings that constrain the final choice to fence rather than mediate. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over how tomorrow’s quarrels will travel—tightens once: the unrecognized overture in architecture forces Darius to abandon passive waiting and openly duel. Agency is foregrounded in the sundial adjustment and rapier draw; the price is the exposure of his secret cartographic method. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: the geometry of argument can be weaponized or harmonized. Subtext resides in silent angles—sundial beams, needle spirals—rather than declared ethics. Final image of “poised, dignified chaos” offers resonant non-verbal answer: tomorrow is not owned but redirected. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the open blade and unread overture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Darius’s perceptual signature: time sliced by gear-clicks, arguments as thrust-parry sequences, sunlight read like worried faces. Syntax mirrors fencing rhythm—looped clauses that feint, then hit. No head-hopping; distance stable. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“we have come to debate the ownership of tomorrow”) carries status challenge. Voice modulates from meditative to combative without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances argument, image, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“rebuttals made of thrust”) is patterned early and paid off, avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clauses vary in length to mimic fencing tempo. Minor filter verbs remain voice-motivated, e.g., “he realized,” immediately grounded in sensory proof.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—dueling philosopher who routes quarrels via sundial angles and haberdashery constellations—is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Synthesizes clockpunk, academic satire, and fencing metaphors without checklist feel. Risk: hiding an overture in architecture and tin spiral; payoff justifies experiment. Specificity (composer-turned-cobbler, thesis duel costing an arm) prevents trope recycling.</comment>
