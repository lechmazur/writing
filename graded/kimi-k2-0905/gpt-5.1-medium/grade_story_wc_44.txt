<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysa’s quiet, obsessive precision—memorized steps, lantern hooded, months clandestine tracing—grounds every beat; the “terrifying freedom” line crystallizes a renunciation whose price is felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, only recalled, so the 9+ gate just fails, but interiority is otherwise concrete, embodied, and stake-scaled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: illicit ascent → key/socket → spoon/loop ritual → aperture opens → shadow origin revealed → scholar altered. Closure is a Charged Poise: “disciplined, terrifying freedom” reweights the world-rule with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; lens (Causal) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating-isle observatory, brass domes, mirrored spoons, and hidden-hour bell are filtered through Lysa’s scholar gaze; the spoons’ straightening/aperture function directly constrains her final choice. Micro-setting (key socket) charges closure; only narrow miss is absence of sensory layering under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—tightens causally with each loop closed; the final spoon-straightening narrows options to irreversible seeing. Cost is conceptual but legible: knowledge that can’t be un-known. One tightening suffices; no escalation slippage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Lysa’s orbit of loops: knowledge demands self-revision. The closing image re-prices noon as “more night than midnight,” a resonant conceptual flip. No sermon; ambiguity lingers in “quiet storm.” Earned, particular, non-generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s perceptual signature—rune-trained, numerically precise, tactile with brass—shapes every clause. Rhythm modulates from measured ascent to clipped ritual diction under pressure. No head-hop; compression is taught early (“hours that did not exist”) and paid off. Filter verbs minimal, voice sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers image, motion, and lore; no paraphrase loops. Mixed-metaphor risk in “quiet banners”/”patient compass” but pattern stays legible. Minor scaffold in “years of fearful, reverent ascent” could trim, yet doesn’t dull closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of clock-punk, rune astronomy, and ontological shadow physics feels fresh yet inevitable. Spoon-bending kitchen event three years prior and non-existent hour bell are specific inventions that couldn’t swap settings. Risky elliptical structure paid off in resonant final inversion.</comment>
