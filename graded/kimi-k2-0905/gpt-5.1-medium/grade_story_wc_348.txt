<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-driven interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., the “cavernous silence” of her promotion—but the brother Leo remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible can’t activate. The pivotal micro-choice (carrying the chrysalis to the ravine) is understated; cost is felt yet not sharpened by on-page opposition. Flaws (avoidance, over-cerebral grief) shape tactics, yet the final stance shift reads more meditative than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: river-braid imagery threads past accident into polymer redesign, landing a Charged Poise at the ravine edge. Closure reweights guilt into “something more spacious,” with conceptual cost (patent interest vs. private grief) legible. One soft spot: the resin breakthrough is summarized, not scene-tested, so the causal link between river insight and lab success is elliptical rather than taut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Braided ravine is a living character—stones slick, channels arguing—constraining Mara's daily movements and mirrored in polymer architecture. The empty chrysalis micro-object charges the final image, tying river biology to lab rebirth. Environmental specificity never stalls momentum; sensory economy favors sound and touch under overcast light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform guilt into safer flow—tightens once: river-foam insight enabling a resin that reroutes disaster. Escalation is accumulative pattern-break rather than external antagonism; visible price is interior (perpetual sabbatical, patent expectations sidestepped). Stakes stay personal; no credible resource loss is dramatized on-page, keeping pressure cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “separation as distance, not absence” emerges organically through braid/foam/unzipping polymer motifs; no sermonizing. Final image of “rough, forgiving chord” offers resonant non-literal payoff. Complexity acknowledged—corporate interest lurks outside frame—but story resists easy moral, holding ambiguity. Insight feels earned from particulars, though river-as-lesson veers close to nature-wisdom trope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person sustains a scientist’s perceptual signature—molecular weight as chorus, resin as bridge—without slipping into jargon for its own sake. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences swell like river braids, then compress into notebook equations. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is internal-only; voice stays coherent under grief pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) fits Mara’s frame yet borders poetic convenience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line craft is dense and propulsive; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “Below, the river braided and unbraided itself, composing a music she could almost understand”). Figurative layering is deliberate, but several metaphors stacked across one paragraph risk purple haze. Minor paraphrase loop near “divergent path” refrain; not fatal. Closing image lands cleanly, no artifact there.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of polymer science, river hydrology, and grief work feels fresh; trope of nature-healing is offset by lab-bench material engineering. Synthesis makes hindsight inevitability: foam patterns → unzip-and-rejoin polymer → safer disaster reroute. Risk is moderate—lyric interiority over scene drama—but stakes stay personal, avoiding TED-talk uplift. Could swap names, yet scientific lens and chrysalis reprise root it uniquely.</comment>
