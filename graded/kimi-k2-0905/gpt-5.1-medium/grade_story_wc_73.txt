<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is textured—his love of the chipped die’s skewed fairness and his refusal to stop walking both feel idiosyncratic and grounded. Yet the “missed doorway” backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that never pricks the present beat; we get no micro-choice that dramatizes what staying would have cost, so the renunciation lands pre-packaged rather than earned in scene. The result is a credible but not wrenching endurance; the emotional price is asserted more than embodied in a present-temperature shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The staircase’s infinite twist is anchored immediately; orientation is clear by line 3. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each landing’s hairline asymmetry and dice roll thickens the pattern until the crack reveals the parallel self. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crack seals, the other Arin vanishes, and the cost is the legible forever-gap; the notebook proofs never need to “work” because the engine he actually builds is the relentless present-tense walk. The only causal fuzz is the off-stage doorway exit, but the lens holds and the final image reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The staircase is rendered through tactile difference—warm railing, darker stone—rather than architectural blueprint, letting the environment mirror Arin’s internal asymmetry. The velvet bag’s nap, die clatter, and notebook margins act as micro-settings that constrain choice: he can’t roll fairness, only continuation. The final crack is a literal rupture in the stone that lets the alternate staircase press against his skin, charging the closing image with spatial cost. Selective sensory hierarchy keeps the blankness from feeling like a white-room; every detail is POV-filtered for motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove arrival unnecessary via perpetual motion—arrives early and tightens when the crack shows the parallel self who did enter a door, making the cost of refusal visible. Escalation is textural: each asymmetric landing layers the pressure of “keep walking” versus “what if.” The dice throws and notebook scrawls are micro-choices that feed the same tactic rather than branching options, so the deepening is atmospheric, not tactical. The price is conceptual but legible: the sealed crack forecloses the only visible off-ramp, leaving the staircase as the sole future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: perpetual motion as existential stance, not engineering feat. The chipped die’s bias toward falling mirrors Arin’s bias toward forward motion; the cracked wall reframes the missed doorway as a sealed asymptote rather than a regret. No character utters a thesis; meaning accrues through the tactile recurrence of stone, dice, and notebook scratches. The final line’s “stubborn circles of meaning” is the closest to commentary, but it is earned by the accumulative image chain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled—long syntactic spirals mimic the staircase without tumbling into monotony. Perceptual signature is precise: Arin notices wear-patterns, thermal ghosts, and the die’s wobble as indices of fairness rather than fate. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within the self-taught mathematician’s lexicon; “beautiful nonsense” is as close to ornament as the diction gets, and it is motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image and abstraction—without scaffold. The only micro-loop is the repeated “no first step and no last” echo, but it is purposeful refrain, not churn. Metaphors (“diagram for perpetual motion sketched by an exhausted god”) are audacious yet internally coherent. Clause length varies to create breath-points on the climbs, and no artifact touches the final crack image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Infinite-stair stories risk Kafka-lite cliché, but here the perpetual-motion engine and chipped-die bias give the conceit a fresh mechanical hinge. The parallel-stair crack is a visual twist not previously overworked. Emotional specificity—refusing to stop as a way to texture loss—prevents abstract allegory. The synthesis feels inevitable only at the end, not derivatively telegraphed.</comment>
