<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is richly concrete—salt-swollen notebook, fingertip dimpling the star—and the final “Let us go inland together” is earned by the slow ache of the pause. Flaw: the “I had built my work…” paragraph drifts into abstract self-diagnosis that momentarily flattens embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision seeps in like groundwater, reconfiguring both futures with felt cost—the sea life he must now seasonally forfeit. Lens holds Accumulative: each tide-mark image layers density until the final line crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“grotto”), well within waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting dominates: the jade cicada functions as both mirror and clock, constraining the final choice by making inland time audible. The grotto’s starlit water pools are not backdrop but instruments—the protagonist tests futures by touching their reflections. One hairline slip: “stone” repeats four times in the last quarter, dulling the sensory rim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—leave or stay—is signaled early and tightens through silence rather than event; the pause itself becomes the pressure. Escalation is the accrual of overlapping future-images, each a tide mark that raises the cost of either path. Cost is legible: the seasonal return promise sacrifices year-round coastal identity.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: time as littoral, not linear—every pause a shoreline that can be chosen. The cicada’s underground patience mirrors the protagonist’s realization that lives need not harden before entry. No thematic echo is spoken; the final image of cyclical return reweights all prior tidal metaphors without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tidal—syntax swells and recedes, mirroring water’s grammar. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: barnacles “like shut eyes,” stars “sharpened.” One register drift: “conceptual repricing” and “texture of time” flirt with academic diction, but the rhythm recovers in the groundwater simile.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, no loops, metaphors mutually coherent (tide-marks, groundwater, shoreline sand). Rhythm breathes with the pause itself—long sentences slow, then break at “Let us go.” Minor purple fleck: “mirrors of water in the stone” is twice used, softening the final shine.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshens the oldest conflict—sea vs. land—by reframing choice as sedimentary, not binary. The “tangential approach” to future-seeing via starlit puddles is a precise, non-obvious device. Risk in quiet ending pays off: no wave-crash decision, only groundwater inevitability.</comment>
