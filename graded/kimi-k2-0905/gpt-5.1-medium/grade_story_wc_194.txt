<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurel’s custodial fatalism is vivid and embodied; interior contradiction crackles as he “presses flat” the lethal ledger. The abdication signature becomes a lived scar, not backstory décor. Yet the queen’s younger voice, though chilling, is received passively—no fresh micro-choice re-opens the wound on the page, so the final cost is felt through sound only, not deed. Still, the refusal to re-write history lands as credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) arrives the instant the needle hovers above bare metal and the queen’s ring-thud reweights Aurel’s identity; the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, the sepia room itself the record. Orientation locks within ~120 words via “sepia reading room,” “first yawn of evening,” and named city heat. Cost is legible in the standing-wave image that forever replays his complicity—no shot fired, but sound never dies. Persistent constraint: the gramophone’s hum now lives in his marrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Palatine Library is no backdrop; dust motes become “mute constellations” that guide Aurel’s attention, the moth-eaten cloth shrouding acoustic evidence. The oak table’s old-tea glow concentrates the dynasty’s genealogy into tactile guilt. Micro-setting triumph: the bare platter and sticky crank transmit literal tremor, allowing the room itself to speak. Setting thus charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Aurel face the pre-abdication silence he signed? Pressure intensifies sonically: each crank rotation tightens the spring of archival guilt until the queen’s recorded surrender slices away any chance to blame others. No external antagonist needed—the standing waves are prosecutor and jury. Cost is visible: the low hum now nests inside him, foreclosing denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges not as “power corrupts” but as resonance outlasting politics—silence is the final monarch. The gramophone, once propaganda machine, becomes truth-teller, repricing Aurel’s label from regicide to archivist of ghosts. No moralizing speech; the theme crystallizes when the ring thuds on wood and sound keeps circulating. Particulars (dust, crank, tea-colored table) carry the abstract into flesh.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains a historian’s melancholy diction—“dynasty ender,” “sepia,” “standing waves”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature: Aurel notices texture (sticky grease, metal flower horn) more than people, aligning with custodial solitude. Rhythm swells with the rising hum, syntax lengthens, then fractures at the queen’s frost-crisp consonants. No head-hop; voice coherence holds through the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors acoustic build: short tactile clauses early, then longer wave-like sentences as hum thickens. No loops or filler; “dust hung like mute constellations” does double sensory job. Figurative language stays physics-true (standing waves, crest of possibility) yet emotionally legible. The final image—“ring placed on wood”—is bare, letting sound carry weight, no metaphor overload in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing archival hauntology with acoustic physics feels fresh; the library becomes an instrument, the abdication a cut groove. Risk: using no actual disc, yet the empty platter still “plays,” is bold and pays off. The trope of fallen dynasties is inverted—collapse is acoustic, not martial. Specificity (tea-oak table, moth-eaten cloth) prevents abstract gimmickry; the concept earns its own after-echo.</comment>
