<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet fearing the cost—surfaces in the tremor he feels under the quartz; the final renunciation of the sanctioned “gratitude” poem is earned by that bodily memory of smoke and the colonnade’s answering hum. Embodied emotion stays specific: smoke “like punctuation stripped of meaning,” the lectern’s “tree rings of sound.” Micro-choice—stepping off the dais empty-handed—carries visible social cost (he forfeits official approval). No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV coherence strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lio refuses the assigned poem and exits the dais, crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the audible hush he steps into—approval forfeited, but voice reclaimed. Causal chain intact: because the colonnade answers his whisper, therefore he dares abandonment of the script. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“town finally unlocks…”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive holds—each footstep adds tonal density until the final chord reweights freedom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting: its vibration literally modulates Lio’s volume and courage, then charges the final image when the hum swells as he falls silent. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—poet notices timbre, color of slate, smoke as punctuation. Spatial choreography clean: path of darker tiles leads dais-ward; exit retraces it. Environment constrains choice—only here can sound become safe again—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim language without being re-devoured by it—signaled in line 3. One meaningful tightening: the colonnade’s rising scale forces the choice—read the safe poem or speak extemporaneously—cost is the hush that greets his refusal. Agency sits with Lio; no coincidence resolves. Escalation is the ascending chord that makes silence unbearable, pushing him off script.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between sanctioned and unsanctioned sound; no explicit thesis stated. Final image—man walking freely among pillars that continue to hum—reweights “boundaries” from political to acoustic, letting reader feel liberty as vibration rather than slogan. Subtext in the lectern’s dustless surface: the room has always expected betrayal of the official script. Complexity preserved—reopening is both gift and trap—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is poet-specific: “cloud-shadow,” “unspent weather,” “smoke like punctuation” all filter through a metaphor-minded lens. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences build, then fracture into the short refusal clause. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression (“lantern-moth hush”) is taught early and paid off in the swaying rafters. POV distance stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: anaphora (“He wrote…”) accelerates, then clipped final sentence lands the exit. Figurative density high but patterned—stone-as-throat, quartz-as-rib—never muddled. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances stakes. Information-dense: one sentence often does setting + emotion + backstory (“He remembers… smoke rose…”). Minor filter verbs appear but serve lyric distance; no scaffolding obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise—resonant architecture that outlaws harmony—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if relocated: the quartz colonnade is irreplaceable. Risk in the unsaid poem pays off; reader must imagine the refused gratitude, intensifying theme. No close echoes of canonical scenes; specificity of “cobalt atrium by frozen lake” anchors uniqueness.</comment>
