<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"weight sharp, like gravel in marrow"—but the lone POV never faces an on-page opposing will, so status/relationship pressure is absent. The final micro-choice—lifting the lamp toward her own fear—earns the shift, yet the cost is more imagistic than viscerally felt. Still, the contradictory impulse (cling to fear vs. release into pattern) is dramatized in the wrist-turn that breaks calcification, satisfying the 9+ test within the single-POV crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the protagonist’s fear is reweighted into the fractal dance, cost legible in “one more note in the shingled hush.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each burden’s translation tightens the pattern until her own dread is assimilated. Orientation is taught early (“bronze grotto under starlight” by line 2) and pays off in the mirrored basin; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the grotto will forget, and she must keep returning—this price shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto’s metallic breath and whalebone lamp ribs are not backdrop but tools that constrain technique—flame must be braided, not scattered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: threshold step, basin kneel, wrist-turn, exit. The lamp’s evolving state (lit, raised, re-interpreted) directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the patterns from calcifying—tightens when her own unnamed fear surfaces. Escalation is textural: each burden’s absorption increases the invisible geometry’s density until her personal dread threatens to lattice her lungs. The decisive turn—orient toward, not away—reconfigures the pull without external coincidence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she leaves carrying the same weight arranged differently, foreclosing the illusion of purgation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “weight can be steered, not shed,” never stated outright but enacted through fractal braiding. The shingled hush reweights from silent roof to participatory chord, a resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing—ambiguity remains: the grotto will still forget. The emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the changed pull, not an aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific—“whalebone reverie,” “thin blue tongue tasting metallic breath”—and rhythmically controlled, accelerating under pressure then exhaling in the final sentence. Perceptual signature is consistent: everything filtered through a craftsperson who sees densities, angles, moons on tide. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens exactly as the flame climbs. The prose itself performs the fractal weave it describes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense yet each metaphor does double duty—“old coins” links value and bruise, economy and pain. One paraphrase loop (“boundary-lessly trapped” echoed twice) is purposeful, teaching the paradox. No mixed vehicles; clarity intact even at peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of harvesting intangible heaviness and braiding it with flame-thread is fresh; the fractal-craft logic is followed to its inexorable conclusion. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. Could not swap setting or tool without collapsing the entire mechanism. Specificity trumps trope: not a generic cave but a bronze grotto that breathes.</comment>
