<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and specific to the narrator’s grief (“small paper rectangle… softer than any relic should be”). The reluctant metamorphosis is dramatized through visceral bodily fusion with the grove, earning the final trans-human union. Motivation stays locked to reforging the bond, and the cost—loss of human form—is legible on the page. Only minor dip: the beasts’ interior stance is ventriloquised rather than revealed through their own choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each spice grain, the fortune slip, and the name spoken are “because” triggers that culminate in the narrator’s arboreal transformation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lovers inhabit death together, moonlight in every petal, cost paid by his unmaking. Orientation anchors arrive by line 4; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip: “three years” dead is stated but not woven into any beat before the summoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard, moon, and cauldron tree are not backdrop but apparatus: the hollow trunk receives spices, the moon nails the sky, petals hum secrets—these constrain ritual steps and final image. Body-as-setting occurs as feet root into listening soil and later as the narrator becomes grove. Spatial choreography stays exact: beasts circle, embers fall, seeds form. The environment literally digests the protagonist, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when spice scent starts irreversible metamorphosis. One meaningful turn: the moment fortune slip lifts and her smoke-hand touches bark-cheek, foreclosing human future. Cost is visible—body becomes tree, beasts dissolve—yet escalation is single-arc rather than layered reversal. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but lacks secondary pressure or unexpected complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of love redefined as shared inhabitation of mortality emerges through image, not thesis: moonlit petals, listening roots, ember-seeds. Final image—two spirits twined inside a grove—reweights the earlier fortune “distance no map shows” as metaphysical, not geographical. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost of unmaking. Minor echo of “cosmic intimacy” drifts toward label, but saved by concrete final fusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is hypnotic, rhythmic, synesthetic: “soil cool and alert beneath my heels, as if listening back.” Syntax lengthens under spell, fragments under transformation, mirroring thawing ice. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays tightly to narrator’s grief-heightened senses. Diction stays within plausible lexicon until arboreal shift, where vegetal metaphors are motivated by literal fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like ritual chant; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high: one line can do scent, myth, and bodily change. Two stacked metaphors (“moon… nailed to the sky,” “distance… width of the moon”) flirt with excess but paid off when moon becomes literal nail for phoenix embers. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing necromancy, arboreal transmutation, and fortune-cookie prophecy feels inevitable, not collage. Phoenix-rising frame and moonlit orchard are familiar myth threads, but the narrator’s self-grooving to inhabit death together is fresh synthesis. Risk—lyric compression, cosmic tone—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Specificity of spice list and paper relic prevents abstract drift.</comment>
