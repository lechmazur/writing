<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—“empathizing with the building,” “small tenderness he hid inside his work.” One micro-choice (taking the broom as staff) crystallizes the arc. Cost is legible: visibility over invisibility. Missing: a second character to test status, but single-POV default met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure: Charged Poise—he reconfigures identity from cleaner to witness, broom becomes staff, cost is lifelong exposure. Accumulative lens: stillness/density build to final image. Lantern glass causally triggers every monitor flicker; no prop teleport. Orientation anchored by line 3. No meaningful escalation flaw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tracking dome functions as micro-setting: console dust “crushed nebulae,” monitors “almost remembered how to listen.” Yellow lantern glass recurs, constrains final stance. Sensory triage—metallic tang, ozone—filters through janitor’s professional eye. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: visibility vs erasure. Tightening occurs when lantern glass forces literal projection of his hidden empathy; option to remain unseen is foreclosed. Cost is on-page: “chest ached,” “hurt felt spacious.” Agency: he lifts glass, steps closer, whispers promise—each act ups exposure. Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: custodial labor transmuted into cosmic witnessing. No moral stated; final image of broom-as-staff reweights prior mopping scenes. “Flourishing stillness” reframed from emptiness to “dense, patient fullness,” anchored in lantern-glass vision. Image-based, not assertive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked to janitor; perceptual signature strong—“dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae.” Diction stays within his lexicon: “mops than mantras,” “pipes breathing.” Syntax breathes with long contemplative runs, then clipped “He watched.” No head-hopping; no dialogue to distort.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: cadence rises/falls with revelation, no template drumbeat. High density—each sentence layers metaphor AND advances image. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor scaffold: “dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae” could trim one modifier, but doesn’t obscure closure. Clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor cosmography—cleaning the sky’s forgotten corners. Lantern glass as projector of human moments, not star data, flips SF trope. Broom=staff transformation feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric accumulation paid off in final image. Avoids sentimentality via concrete specificity.</comment>
