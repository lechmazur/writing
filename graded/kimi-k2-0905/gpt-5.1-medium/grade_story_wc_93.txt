<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—Arin’s foresight collides with his inability to refuse the stillness he dreads. The moment knees scrape stone and pain returns, the cost of witnessing is made flesh. Micro-choices (stone placement, dust release) chart a hierarchy of values without exposition. Precognitive curse never slips into label-speak; it is lived through doubled time and bodily risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: friction’s return reweights the premise—motion is debt, not freedom. Causal linkage holds: each stone sequence is a because/therefore step toward re-imposing tax. The final image—aurora drying like ink on proof—makes the social cost undeniable. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor by line 3 and serve the final lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment (frictionless bluff, glassy sea, aurora) actively constrains tactics: eels can be accompanied, not caught; stones stay where placed because world-rules forbid drift. Micro-object—the vial—charges the final image as its grains align along vectors that re-impose friction. Sensory economy is ruthless: “colors poured like melted compasses” fuses sky, tool, and epistemic collapse in five words. Spatial choreography survives headcount of one; body, stones, eels, and dust track cleanly across the cliff lip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness vs. intervene—tightens when the lens doubles: seeing himself slip forever forces the choice to stay and finish the pattern. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: stillness moves from cosmic to corporeal as knees meet stone. Cost is the returned pain that forecloses the option to retreat. Agency is renunciation—he pays the tax for the world but keeps the equations that let pain mean.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation that separates falling from flight; no character states it—image does. The re-pricing of friction as sacred debt is felt in the slap of the late wave. Ambiguity lingers: is Arin savior or collector? Motifs (painted symbols, collapsed star) recur only to constrain choice, not decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a perceptual signature: maritime fatalism braided with mathematic mysticism. Syntax lengthens and contracts with time-doubles: “he watched himself watch himself” compresses precognition without filter-verb bloat. Diction stays inside Arin’s plausible lexicon—”astronomer-priests” not “astrophysicists.” No head-hopping; aurora shifts are read through his symbol-tuned eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: short percussive clauses at the cliff edge, liquid elongation during eel flight. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphor density peaks only at the closure beat where “ink drying on proof” marries cosmos and ledger. Line-level artifacts zero; no scaffold, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: speculative physics of frictionless Earth fused with numinal mathematics of coastal folklore. Risk—making pain the desired outcome—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of painted prime-lattice and eel-herding lore makes premise unportable. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet un-predicted, the hallmark of authentic originality.</comment>
