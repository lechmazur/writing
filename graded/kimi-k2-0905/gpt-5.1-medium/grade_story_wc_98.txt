<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—guardian of fixed memory who must decide whether to let memory shift—remains concrete and embodied; the seed’s weight against his palm, the ridge flowers closing as he passes, his sideways fall into sleep all externalize the conflict. His micro-choice to “listen” rather than adjudicate immediately crystallizes values under pressure. The dream’s revelation that the island’s story begins elsewhere is earned by prior ritual and omen buildup, and his final luminous doubt carries visible cost: the island may “stretch” beyond the safety of the seed. No therapy-speak or stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through his perceptual lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream reweights the seed from sacred anchor to possible relic of exile, forcing Kael to accept a vaster, less certain memory. Cost is legible in the final image—“luminous doubt pool[ing] in his chest”—and the monsoon’s early arrival externalizes the irreversible shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated omens, dialects, spiral shells, and goat stares tighten the pattern until the dream reframes the whole texture. One minor scaffold: “simple in words and complicated in practice” is abstract paraphrase, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge, seed, lagoon, meeting-house ceiling poles, and dream-tree are all specific, sensory, and POV-filtered; flowers closing “as if unwilling to overhear” turns environment into moral witness. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, set seed on stone, sideways fall. Weather (early thunderheads) is causal, not backdrop—it forces the council’s summons and Kael’s night vigil. The seed functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; without it the dream’s revelation would lose its pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect vs. expand collective memory—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the island itself “reaches backward.” The meaningful deepening is the dream’s showing an earlier homeland, which reframes every prior omen as possible truth rather than aberration. Agency is Kael’s decision to listen rather than suppress, a renunciation that forecloses the safety of fixed memory; the price is the luminous doubt he must now carry. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each omen adds density until the dream reweights the whole pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular contradiction of a seed that never sprouts yet anchors memory; the final image reconfigures that seed as potential evidence of exile rather than origin. Subtext operates through silence: the island “would not name” its dream, forcing the people to half-believe together—democracy of memory rather than fiat. No explicit moral; the closing “luminous doubt” is a felt re-pricing, not a lesson. The tension between safety and accuracy is left legibly unresolved, inviting reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught early (“empirically whimsical, disciplined as tidal charts”) so the reader accepts elisions like “sideways into the island’s dreaming.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices light, sea-breath, seed-weight, never abstracts beyond his craft. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for dream descent, clipped fragments for council tension. No head-hopping; dream voices are framed as external perception, not interior intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “reefs would forget where to grow, turtles where to crawl ashore, lovers whom to wait for” compresses ecological, zoological, and emotional stakes in one line. Metaphors are coherent—luminous doubt, storm-river wrinkles—and avoid purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “simple in words and complicated in practice” echoes later “simple yet complicated” but occurs early and is brief. Final image is uncluttered, letting “luminous doubt pool in his chest” carry the reweighting without additional figurative scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fantasy-island memory-checker premise is fresh, yet grounded in anthropological reality—oral cultures do debate dream-omens. The seed that never sprouts but must be carried is a concrete inversion of the usual fertile MacGuffin. Risky lyric structure (oneiric climax) is taught early and pays off by reframing every prior omen. The synthesis feels inevitable: an island that dreams itself must also dream its own exile.</comment>
