<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor’s grief-soaked reticence is palpable; every micro-choice (tracing lace, breathing with the tide) externalizes guilt. The final non-verbal apology is earned because the text has tethered his silence to Mira’s absence from line 1. Interior contradiction—hope vs. disbelief in the tides—stays active in scene, not summary. Just shy of 9 because the cost is felt but not yet enacted; he still waits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, compass click, violet light) tightens the same stake—can regret reach across severance? Closure is a Charged Poise: the lace flag lifts, ghost ships coalesce, options reconfigure without guaranteeing reunion, cost paid in lifelong uncertainty. Orientation anchored by 50 words; no teleporting props. One causal micro-turn—compass locking on grove—propels the final beat. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The islet’s wet stones, warped box, and salt-sweet air are not backdrop but instruments: the grove’s scent of “opened books and seaweed” cues memory retrieval; the compass warms only when soil is touched. Micro-setting (lace between fingers) literally translates apology into color, constraining the final gesture. Weather shifts coincide with emotional inflections without overt symbolism. Environment charges the closing image—ships materialize because place allows tides of remembrance to intrude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the unsent apology—remains singular and gains density as each object (compass, lace) amplifies the risk of permanent silence. Mid-story pattern break—compass abandons north—forces tactical pivot into grove, escalating stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: he accepts that forgiveness may never return, only the possibility of it. Could edge higher if a concrete forfeiture (time, tool, limb) were dramatized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “regret is a tide that returns what we finally learn to release.” No thesis stated; violet light, salt-stained lace, and ghost ships carry the abstraction. Final image reweights the premise: apology exists as color, not speech—conceptual repricing with undeniable social cost. Subtext in the tutor’s slowed breath and needle’s jerk shows that silence itself is a violent act. Complexity preserved: reunion left uncertain, moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to tutor’s perceptual filter: “slow-spoken,” “stiff fingers,” “aging jaw.” Syntax elongates and contracts with his breath, mirroring bonsai patience. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through weighted nouns and maritime verbs. Register never drifts into writerly purple; every metaphor is sea-bound and character-true. One clause—“rinsed ink” sky—edges poetic but earns its place as his professional color vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses like surf: long sentences for mist, fragments for compass click. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interior). No loops or synonym churn; “rhythmically placid” returns twice but each time retooled (breeze, then lungs). Minor scaffold: “the severance had taken…” paragraph summarizes off-stage events; however, it lands early and primes present stakes without stalling momentum. Closure line breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing bonsai discipline with maritime ghost lore feels inevitable here, not grafted. Lace-as-navigational-code transforms a domestic textile into an apotropaic device—fresh, specific, irreversible. Risk taken: no on-page Mira, no spoken words, yet emotional charge spikes. Conceptual risk—apology rendered as sea-stained violet—pays off under Accumulative lens. Could nudge 9+ with slightly more concrete world rule anchoring of how lace stores memory.</comment>
