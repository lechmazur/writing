<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory impulses—yearning to vanish yet compelled to restore communal joy—surface in the single present-tense beat of mounting the projectors; the final renunciation of protest for quiet gifting is earned by the prior city ban and his own exile, costing him permanence. Interiority stays concrete (“laugh caught between pensive mirth and relief”), never drifting into label-speak. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; micro-choice hierarchy is visible when he opts for light over pigment. Flaw: we never feel the mistake or genuine struggle—setup to payoff is almost too smooth, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wall becomes “exposed film developing,” reweighting the premise—light murals can repossess public joy without ownership—at undeniable conceptual cost (power dies, image vanishes). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of color/fog images tightens toward the charged poise final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One reflective block obeys BRR. Eligible for 9+ but final sentence is slightly cushioned; cost is felt but not given a sharper physical constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fog and crumbling plaster constrain projector placement and motivate the light tactic; the orchard’s dead branches turned “crooked chandeliers” charge the final image. Sensory selection skews to taste and sight, matching an artist POV. Spatial choreography is clean—projectors circle the clearing, wall remains fixed. Micro-setting (hacked projectors) functions as setting and tool. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image; only a hair’s-breadth short of 9.0 due to slight over-reliance on visual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy without arrest—signaled early; pressure escalates as each projector hums awake, narrowing options from permanent paint to ephemeral light. One meaningful tightening: he abandons protest for quiet gifting, foreclosing legal conflict but accepting impermanence. Accumulative lens: density of communal memories projected heightens cost of power-loss. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a concrete external risk (battery drain, drone cop) had materialized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—art’s right to ephemeral joy versus control—emerges through image, not statement; final “city secretly recalling laughter” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in “someone long ago had painted an orchard” quietly links past and present refusal to forget. No motif checklist; fog recurs because it literally interferes with projection. Insight earned: communal memory can outrun commodification even if only for a breath. Stops just shy of 9.0 because thematic turn is more delicate than devastating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Lio’s shoulder, perceptual signature in synesthetic “taste color,” rhythmic anaphora “He had painted… He had wandered.” No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under projector glow. Compression and elision (“No cans rattled inside”) taught early and paid off. Syntax mirrors painter’s mind: stacked color clauses, then short release “He laughed now, softly.” Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct and controlled under pressure. Borderline 9.0, capped at 8.9 only because one clause drifts toward editorial summary (“People said he paints with light”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—metaphors of film, lungs, chandeliers—each serving beat’s emotional temperature. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, backstory, and tactic. One mixed metaphor (“knowledge network of color”) is minor; no artifacts near closure. Meets 9+ quick test; prose propels without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresco-plus-projection synthesis feels fresh; reverses usual street-art trope by making impermanence the solution, not the problem. Knowledge-network of scraped birthday photos is specific tech repurposing, not gimmick. Risk—abandoning spray cans for drones—heightens stakes and coherence. Transformation evident: swap any element (city, medium, memory source) and the emotional calculus collapses. Earns within-band bonus for bold yet coherent experimentation.</comment>
