<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ela’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices (folding ash birds, stitching herself into the dome); the shift from “closed-eye” rings to “shaky arcs” shows earned, visible change. Interiority avoids label-speak—grief refracts through light and metalwork. The final stance—sketching pieces for the almost-living—pays the cost of abandoning pure mourning. Riv remains a functional catalyst rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is off-page; head-count does not harm clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Riv offers the impossible loom, therefore Ela accepts; because she plants each bird, the dome reconfigures light and self. The meteor shower ignition is the decisive change that makes her “ruins glow,” paying an undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no teleporting props. Closure lands in the final sketch—it forecloses disappearance and re-opens bloom with felt opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s ribbed metal, catwalks, and central shaft act as micro-setting that literally constrains her path; each coordinate is a rivet she must touch. Sensory hierarchy favors starlight, ash, and fractured halos—details that charge the final image. The dome’s slow turning and “luminous rain” of curtains integrate mood with mechanics, no exposition dump. Spatial choreography stays clean as she climbs and scatters birds; environment evolves causally with each circuit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be taught to bloom?—is signaled in Riv’s offer. Escalation is accumulative: each origami bird incrementally reweights the light until the meteor shower ignites coordinates, tightening options from mourning to almost-living. No reversals, but one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is visible—ash capsules burn into brief stars, proving the path cannot be walked twice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the refracted light motif rather than thesis: mourning jewelry that learns to unfold. Subtext lives in silence—Riv never claims to heal, only to cut. The final image of sketching for the almost-living offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier closed-eye rings. No moralizing; complexity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Ela’s perceptual signature—starlight as grief, silver thorns as ribs. Syntax tilts into jeweler’s diction: “tiny glass seeds,” “shaky arcs.” No head-hopping; Riv’s interior is unknowable, as it should be. Rhythm accelerates during meteor ignition via breathless clause stacking, then exhales into the quiet sketch morning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Density is high—“curtains of intention,” “chandelier of ghosts” compress world and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances loom, light, or body. Figurative language is patterned early and paid off at ignition. A single mixed risk—“vacuum wind” is impossible but motivated by the spectrometer metaphor—does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief as an astronomical instrument, intention as diffraction grating. The ash origami coordinate system is specific enough to feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—sentient AI astronomer and photon-sorting by desire—never retreats into gimmick; it serves the emotional arc. Transformation test fails if names/places swap, proving organic integration.</comment>
