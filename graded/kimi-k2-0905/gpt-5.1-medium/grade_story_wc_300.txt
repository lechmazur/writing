<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise—her fear of “certifying tombs” versus her hunger to reopen hearts—embodied in the way the clipboard drops useless at her side. Contradictory impulses (professional verdict vs. spiritual confession) act simultaneously in the decisive beat, and her micro-choice to speak aloud costs her the detachment she prizes. The only bar to 9.0: Rafi remains a silent echo rather than a second pressure crucible, so status dynamics stay one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored facet, shell, and pearl layer thickens the same question—what survives, the body or the heart—until the final image reweights “safety.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the provisional “safe” tick-box is dwarfed by the felt reopening aboveground. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early (“layer upon quiet layer”) and paid off when the pearl crowns their hesitation with undeniable light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystalline walls, pedestal, and etched shells are not backdrop but tools that solicit her confession; the pearl’s glow literally paints her hands, constraining her ability to leave unchanged. Spatial choreography is flawless—pedestal, shelf, exit route remain tracked. Micro-setting (the clipboard she forgets) mirrors internal shift. Missing 0.1: no non-visual sense activated under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep sealing tombs or risk reopening hearts—tightens the instant the pearl brightens at her hesitation. Escalation is textural: each shell-filled spiral adds moral weight until speech becomes the only remaining move. The cost is visible: her detachment forfeited as the ghost-light stains her skin. Could edge higher if Rafi had forced an explicit trade-off, but the solitary pressure still forecloses her old stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reverb between “abandoned hopes” and “abandoned shelters,” crystallized in the final image of an aboveground heart quietly reopening. No moral is stated; the pearl’s crown reconfigures survival itself as relational rather than atomic. Subtext hums in Rafi’s silence and the darkening spirals. The insight is earned through sensory particulars, not abstract sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: light “waiting to remember itself,” clipboard “forgotten at her side.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with her breath—long cadences in hesitation, fragmentary shards when the pearl flares. No head-hopping; Rafi remains opaque, as seen from her professional wariness. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon until the final crown-image, where elevated metaphor is justified by the transcendent beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—mirrored facets, latent radiance, crown of light—forming one sustained conceit. Information density is high: “canned food or guns” in the same breath as “abandoned hopes” performs world and theme work simultaneously. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the cavern’s hush, climaxing in the single-sentence confession that pulses the pearl.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of bunker inspection with cave-grown bio-spiritual pearl is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric escalation could have collapsed into preciousness, yet it achieves conceptual integrity: shelter evaluation converted into heart evaluation. The pearl-as-crown image is inevitable in hindsight yet surprising on arrival. Derivative-free; no trope checklist, only specific cosmology grown from local particulars.</comment>
