<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s “sandstorm calm” and curatorial gaze are vivid, but her interior contradiction—listening as resistance—stays largely asserted; the final act of listening-through-lock-picking is earned yet the cost (risk of eviction, bodily danger) is only ambient, not embodied. Micro-choices (pressing locket to cement, refusing center stage) align with trait, but we never see her fatigue, doubt, or sore knees—so the endurance feels slightly heroic rather than humanly strained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The causal chain (locket → mailbox → sealed agreement → developers retreat) is tight and legible; the cement surrender beat supplies a sensory micro-turn that pays off the setup. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard’s legal status is rewoven in a single image—signature pages curled like dried bougainvillea—so the “before” (imminent demolition) and “after” (protected commons) are unmistakable. Cost is felt in the collective hush and the crumbling mortar, though Mara’s personal price stays oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The courtyard is not backdrop; its brass mailbox wall, cement dust, and laundry lines constrain tactics (how to open, who can witness) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows Mara’s curator gaze—colors first, sirens last—so every detail is filtered through her stake. The micro-setting (mailbox #9) functions as both lock and key, literally determining legal fate; no swap-in prop would serve the same mechanical role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the courtyard—surfaces by word 120 and tightens when the locket mailbox number is revealed. One meaningful deepening occurs: stories reconstruct the sealed-agreement morning, shifting the conflict from nostalgia to legal survival. Agency is collective rather than solo; Mara’s listening stance enables others to supply the decisive knowledge, so the price is social risk (standing up to developers) rather than individual bodily cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “listening as archival resistance”—never sermonized, only dramatized through the dawn circles and the cement-ears metaphor. The final image of curled signatures reweights the locket from kitsch relic to juridical key, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral tag. Subtext in neighbors’ silences after the reveal carries residual guilt over the woman’s death, allowing complexity rather than tidy victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays close to Mara’s curator sensorium—brass gone “almost black,” hinge “rigid as if it had clenched”—a perceptual signature that fuses metal and breath. Rhythm clusters stressed monosyllables under pressure (“brass kissed what lay buried”) then relaxes into longer cadence at closure, mirroring the cement’s surrender. No head-hopping; every metaphor is filtered through her gaze, achieving lyric coherence without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “steam lifting from cups into the pale air” advances both atmosphere and collective breath that will later “lean through her.” One mixed-metor slip—”open veins along the walls” beside “forgotten organ”—but the body-building motif sustains. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines bookend the listening motif, achieving ear-test resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The thrift-store-as-museum + locked-postbox + oral-archive synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable; the mailbox deed twist grows logically from gentrification stakes rather than gimmick. Risk is taken by making protagonist a listener-facilitator instead of a solo hero, yet the collective agency payoff justifies the choice. Specificity of brass #9 and cement dust could not be swapped without breaking causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s curatorial eye initiates the locket’s journey and her listening method enables the document’s discovery; without her refusal to pry the locket open alone, the communal reconstruction never occurs. Cost appears in her public vulnerability—she stakes her shop’s credibility on folklore. Irreplaceable: any substitute profession would lack the object-reading authority that legitimizes the quest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Locket appears first beat, mediates every hand-off, and its brass tangent physically crushes the cement plug—mechanical payoff unmatched by generic key. Its number and refusal to open act as micro-turns that redirect investigation. Final reprise reweights it from trinket to legal key; removal would collapse the causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Locked mailbox mystery is the entire escalatory engine: it names the stake (legal document), provides the obstacle (cement), and delivers the twist (surviving signatures). Each micro-beat (hearing stories, cement crumble) is filtered through unlocking logic. Without sealed #9, developers have no barrier and story has no pivot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Leads through following” constrains Mara to never seize the spotlight, forcing neighbors to supply the decisive memory—without this self-effacement, the collective testimony collapses. The tactic costs her individual heroism, creating indirect but visible social risk. Swapping the trait would violate her established quiet-storm persona.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Hearing is the method of agency: every testimony is literally heard into existence, and the final cement break is triggered by listening, not prying. The postman’s auditory memory and girl’s imagined pen-scrape are pivotal turns. Remove “hear” and the communal archive never materializes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (“spread the word”), structures the middle beats (door-knocking, dawn circle), and pays off when collective memory supplies the legal truth. Mechanics matter: who tells whom determines which signatures are recalled. Eliminate the chain and the document stays rumor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vibrant courtyard supplies both physical resources (chairs, mailboxes, laundry-line sightlines) and social density for rapid rumor spread. Dawn light provides temporal deadline—developers arrive by daylight—and color palette that mirrors the brass locket. While another communal space could host, the mailbox wall is architecturally unique to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><question>I</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Intrusion timeframe is tracked through rising siren frequency and the ticking approach of surveyors; the dawn circle must finish before full daylight legitimizes demolition crews. The locket arrival on “donation day” plus next-dawn resolution keeps clock legible. Time pressure sharpens the need for overnight storytelling.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><question>J</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Mara’s desire to “prove listening heals” is dramatized in her refusal to force the locket or dominate the circle; the tangible healing is the courtyard’s legal salvation. Conflict emerges when listening risks seeming passive against bulldozers. Final cement crumble externalizes the proof, bonding moral and plot stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Sandstorm calm” tone is established in the opening metaphor and modulates—tightening under cement crunch, expanding at the final hush when signatures are revealed. The calm is threatened but never breaks, charging the last image with poised quiet rather than triumphal noise. Remove the tone and the ending becomes sentimental victory rather than earned stillness.</comment>
