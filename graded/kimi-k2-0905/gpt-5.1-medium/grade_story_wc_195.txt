<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains concrete and particular; Calder’s “rust beneath his skin” and choreography of obeyed commands give embodied contradiction. Micro-choice at the masks—stay but not serve—pays for prior pattern of silent compliance. Mira’s constellational eyes and factual mysticism act as live pressure rather than label. Cost is legible: exile from neededness and from king.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “future had just unsnapped its strings” reweights every prior puppet motif with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: program handed → mask seen → renunciation declared; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation anchored by line 3 (midnight, frost-breathing greenhouse). Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains final choice: only here can masks of future selves be lifted. Metallic trees, bottled-dawn fruit, and silver soil are selective, not catalogued; each detail hums or chimes under touch, guiding Calder toward the decision fork. Glass veins breathing frost returns in final image of “unsnapped strings,” charging closure. Spatial choreography clean: threshold → rows → mask tree; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—possibility versus obedience—signals early and tightens when Calder must pick a mask or reject all. Escalation is single but meaningful: offer of pre-shaped futures → refusal → unpredictability declared; cost is exile from kingdom and from identity as “needed.” No reversal needed; one fork is enough at this length. Price paid on-page: “every command obeyed” re-cast as choreography, not virtue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from puppet/knight/string motif returning reweighted: obedience as jointed wood, freedom as snapped marionette. No explicit moral; final image delivers conceptual repricing. Shifting meaning of “strings” from control to choice is organic, not forced. Ambiguity remains—what unpredictability costs—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Calder notices armor he isn’t wearing, tastes duty as rust, hears flasks whisper. Syntax elongates under wonder (“orchard of experiments, each fruit an equation”) then fractures at renunciation. No head-hopping; Mira’s voice stays external, filtered through his suspicion. Compressed diction at climax (“voice barely more than breath”) mirrors internal cracking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations then abrupt monosyllables (“I will stay”). Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, pressure). No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; “glass apples hummed softly” keeps vehicle consistent. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “came” in noble list, but beat is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Premise—knight cataloguing forbidden fruit confronted by puppet-theatre of futures—feels fresh yet inevitable. Puppet-to-strings-to-unpredictability arc is non-obvious synthesis. Risk in lyric density pays off: final image reconfigures entire grammar of duty. Could not swap orchard for generic garden without breaking metal-mask mechanism.</comment>
