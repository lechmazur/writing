<comment>Mara’s translator’s patience and haunted ambition coexist in every beat; her decision to “reestablish what you have already taken” grows directly from the guide’s vanish and her own craving for knowledge, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete—teeth aching, seed rolling between fingers—without therapy-speak. The only flaw: “kindly methodical” is declared more than dramatized in micro-choices, a −0.4 dent.</comment>

<guide>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s final sentence renegotiates the arbor’s bargain, accepting unwritten cost. Causal chain holds—because the guide vanishes, therefore Mara questions, therefore she offers herself. Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the box/seed appears from a hand that is already wave, a micro continuity glitch −0.2.</comment>

<comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active antagonist—its hum aches teeth, its field smokes a man into pattern. Sky-rooted lattice, pressure-membrane, and trembling air evolve across beats, forcing Mara’s final offer. Selective sensory triangulation (sound→bone→vision) keeps economy. Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes the final image and tactic.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand transition”—is signaled early and tightened when the guide’s vanish makes the abstract lethal. Escalation is situational pressure: each arbor pulse narrows Mara’s options from study → survival → surrender. Cost is legible in her forfeited escape ladder and the unspoken price of her final consent. One beat short of 9+ only because the tightening is atmospheric more than causal.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the Sumerian root “to cross = to ask,” reframed into “transition is relationship.” No overt thesis; the final image of membrane pressed to skin reweights all prior tablets, seeds, and vanishings. Subtext of academic ambition versus mortality is carried in gesture (palm flat to trembling air). Earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, scholarly, yet tactile—syntax lengthens like tablet lines, then cracks into single-word beats under arbor pressure. Perceptual signature is translatorly: every phenomenon is gloss, marginalia, root comparison. No head-hop; distance stays tight third. Experimental compression (“physics of transition,” “knowledge fruit seed”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long cuneiform clauses calm the camp, staccato fragments surface as air thickens. Mixed metaphors (lattice trees / luminous vines) stay coherent within arbor physics. Only hairline loop: “pattern that became winds” echoed twice inside 30 words −0.1. Information density high; every sentence at least doubles (setting + interior or metaphor + stake).</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cuneiform scholarship with magnetic after-life arbor is novel synthesis; transition-as-translation is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in second-person-ish membrane intimacy pays off by making abstract physics visceral. No inherited tropes borrowed without inversion. Specific detail—seed carved with curling script, Sumerian root shared with “ask”—anchors originality in lived discipline.</comment>
