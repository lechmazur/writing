<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio’s levitation as an embodied metaphor for dissociation from his own branching lives is vivid; the micro-choice to step “sideways” rather than up/down crystallizes his values. Interiority stays sensory—“gravity returned in increments”—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of the tablet carries visible cost (loss of map, return to gravity), earned by the corridor walk-through. Flaw: the other selves are glimpsed only as tableaux; we never feel one branch resist or tempt him, so the crucible never quite bites.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the tablet’s drop reweights the premise—algorithmic multiplicity is rejected for singular embodiment. Causal lattice holds: each revisited room seals a fracture, narrated as “because” links (“Each choice he remade bled…”). The mosaic structure is taught by the third paragraph (“rooms bloomed and collapsed…”), transitions legible via corridor/step-through logic. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secured by line 4; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wet-stone reflections and drain-whispers are filtered through Lio’s hyper-attention to gravity and surface; every sensory pick is purposive. Micro-setting bonus: the clay tablet’s refusal to absorb water becomes a tactile rule that foreshadows its later rejection of “rain”/possibility. Spatial choreography is flawless—hover, fall, sideways step—bodies track. The final image of the tablet sliding into black water recharges the earlier “darkening brightness” motif, earning high-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—singular self vs. infinite branching—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens exactly once: when Lio realizes witness, not erasure, is the price (“conquering… meant bearing witness”). Agency drives escalation: each re-entry into a room forecloses that timeline for others. Cost is visible—gravity returns, tablet relinquished—though the tightening beat is solitary narration rather than dramatized resistance from a branch-self, keeping it just sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: multiplicity is unbearable without witness, and singularity demands the surrender of omniscience. Subtext lives in gesture—the tablet slides away wordlessly, no moral stated. The “darkening brightness” refrain reweights from neon spectacle to existential relinquishment. Complexity is honored: no branch is judged better, only owned, resisting tidy profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is gravity-obsessed—“drop and ripple,” “soles never quite touching.” Rhythm modulates: long hypoxic sentences for suspension, then staccato visions under the tablet. No head-hopping; ellipses (“…procedural generation…”) are pattern-taught early and paid off in corridor collapse. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated. Final sentence’s quiet cadence lands as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense: “water beaded… refused to remember the rain” does image + world-rule in one stroke. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. One mixed-metor risk—“shattering” vs “glass”—is minor and doesn’t cloud causality. Momentum never stalls; every paragraph advances either maze logic or bodily cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum-self fantasy filtered through archaic clay tech + urban-noir viaduct. Procedural generation is not gimmick but lived metaphor for regret. Risk—sideways step into non-space—pays off by making gravity’s return legible. Not 9+ only because the branch-selves remain spectatorial; one resisting avatar could have sharpened inevitability.</comment>
