<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s compulsion to “borrow” faces is anchored in concrete, embodied beats (finger on shutter, jar trembling with breath). Interior contradictions—superstition vs. hunger for destiny—play out in real time as the stranger forces the jar opening. The final recognition that the stolen gazes are now “burning reflections” inside the jar lands as earned renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (angle the lens, twist the lid) reveal a hierarchy of values: light > ethics > self; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the jar refills with miniature burning faces, reweighting every prior theft under a moral price the narrator can no longer externalize. Causal lattice holds throughout—because the stranger arrives, therefore the jar must be opened, therefore the archive of gazes is returned as irrefutable evidence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the “aquarium of light” image crystallizes meaning without breaking pattern. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“Emerald Station”) and paid off when the platform reverts to “ordinary night,” satisfying the waiver test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool triangulate to force each beat: the brass camera’s weight against the spine, the tiled archways funneling the last stripe of sun, the jar’s quiver threads that climb pillars once uncapped. Sensory hierarchy is photographer-narrow: vision first, then haptic (brass chill, glass warmth), finally smell of damp marigolds. The station clock “shrugging into twilight” is not postcard colour but a live dial that pressures the shutter press. Final image of the “cool, unspectacular moon” externalizes the narrator’s stripped lens after the conceptual price is paid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator keep stealing light or face what he harvests—tightens when the stranger demands the jar be opened before the portrait. One meaningful intensification: moonbeam spill turns platform into “impossible aquarium,” forcing either complicity or refusal in front of mirrored evidence. Agency remains with protagonist; the shutter click is the decisive act that ignites the cost. Cost is legible: the jar refills with flaming faces, foreclosing the alibi of “borrowing.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: appropriation of others’ radiance eventually exposes the thief to his own accumulated gaze. The illuminated-moment concept shifts from trophy to indictment via the burning reflections, reweighting the premise. No moral is spoken; the final line’s “unsure whether I had stolen or been stolen” invites sustained ambiguity. Resonance is particular, not abstract—faces inside glass, not “we must respect privacy.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person photographer POV sustains a perceptual signature of f-stops, light angles, and metallic chill. Syntax alternates between long liquid sentences (light behaviour) and fragmentary shutter-clicks (“pressed the shutter, cracked the air”) that mimic diaphragm snaps. No head-hopping; stranger’s interior is accessed only through specular flashes the narrator can see. Register stays within photographer lexicon without academic drift; diction like “glass-patient moon” feels idiosyncratic yet legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—single sentences split light, theft, and moral disbelief. No synonym loops; “sun caught their cheek” and “striping our faces gold and shadows” use distinct verbs for visual precision. Mixed-metaphor guardrails respected: moonbeams behave like liquid silver but never contradict prior optic rules. Rhythm accelerates into the shutter-crack clause, then exhales into the cool moon walk-home, matching emotional cadence. Zero line-level artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of photography magic-realism with station-botanical code system feels fresh yet inevitable. The stolen-gaze-as-moonlight concept synthesizes familiar tropes (photographer vampire, coded flowers) into a new moral instrument. Risk: letting lyric imagery carry plot logic pays off because the final reprice is grounded in a concrete visual burn. Transformation test fails if faces are swapped for voices—specificity is tethered to optic theft. Bold reversal of camera as mirror completed without gimmickry.</comment>
