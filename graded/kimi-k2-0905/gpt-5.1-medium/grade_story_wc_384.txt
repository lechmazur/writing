<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Irian’s interior contradiction—perfectionist forger who fears unfinished good-byes—drives every stroke; the final decision to sign in his own hand is pre-saged by the thorn prick and mother-letter memory, so the renunciation feels earned. Micro-choices (hovering nib, brushing thorn) keep guilt embodied. Sevran functions mainly as permission device rather than crucible, preventing 9+. No knowledge leaks or label-speak; emotions stay sensory (pulse in throat, ink warm as blood).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: every altered decree tightens tonight’s risk; the heritage thorn anchors back-story to present choice within 120 words. Key-without-lock taught as symbolic release, pays off when pressed into palm just before the decisive signature—visible cost is exile from anonymity. Closure is clean Charged Poise: “within the wisely enduring sanctuary a different script… had begun” reconfigures all prior forgeries. No orientation debt; transitions tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora light, and stalactite drip act as live clock and moral witness; crystalline apertures soften edges, literally letting Irian see his work anew. Ink, vellum, and observant stone constrain how quietly the pen can move—environment shapes tactics. Rose thorn handled twice, key once—objects qualify as micro-setting. Descriptive load stays selective; no static catalogue. Spatial choreography clean across lectern, floor, columns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save scholars—signalled in first third; each drip = ticking clock that narrows forgery window. Tightening arrives when Sevran appears: exposure forecloses further anonymous sabotage. Agency: Irian decides to claim authorship, paying with lifelong vulnerability. Cost visible on page—“risk exposing every forgery he had ever penned.” Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of authorship vs authorship-for-others emerges through action: forged mercy decree > personal signature = conceptual re-pricing. Language-as-power motif stays implicit; no thesis statements. Mother’s unfinished letter and heritage thorn quietly echo “completion” obsession; final signature reframes that obsession as choice, not pathology. Ambiguity preserved: reader must decide if new history justifies past forgeries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric, elevated register is consistent with sanctuary aurora and calligrapher’s precision; metaphor density taught in opener and sustained. Perceptual signature sharp—“ink bled like confession,” “guilt curled in chest.” Syntax modulates: longer cadences mirror slow drip, then shorten at Sevran’s entrance. No dialogue clutter; single line of speech carries subtext. Pronoun discipline perfect; no filter-verb sludge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tension; no algorithmic patterns. Figurative language dense but patterned from first paragraph, justified by POV. High info density: single sentence often layers ink, guilt, and political stakes. Minor scaffold: three “he had” anaphoras mid-story (−0.2). No contradictory metaphors, no paraphrase loops, no closure artifacts. Clean copy; aurora/stalactite spelling stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Forged-revocation twist feels inevitable yet fresh; calligraphy-as-resistance trope elevated by personal signature pivot. Aurora sanctuary marries ice-beauty with political dread, not mere postcard. Heritage thorn + key-without-lock combo supplies specific symbolic economy. Risk: lyric density could alienate some readers, but payoff at closure justifies gamble. No recognizable pop-culture echoes.</comment>
