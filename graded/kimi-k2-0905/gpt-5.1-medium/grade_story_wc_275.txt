<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mara’s pacifism is dramatized through micro-choices—tea for bounty hunters, pruning shears over knives—so the “senselessly perceptive” trait feels earned rather than labeled. The engraved-quite practice externalizes her internal conflict and produces a visible, continual cost (time, solitude, risk of ridicule) that compounds across the piece; the ending’s “another pulse” crystallizes the renunciation and its price. Interiority stays specific—airship sandbag smells of “rust and faraway storms,” never abstract therapy-speak. Only the father’s “Unerring” label and one or two adjective stacks flirt with cliché, keeping it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: rose-rows accrue meaning until the final cadence reweights the premise under a cracked dome. Anchor beats (who/where/when) land by line 4, transitions are legible, closure arrives as Charged Poise (“another pulse”) with undeniable cost—her body now ventriloquized by the archive she cultivated. No meaningful causality lapses, though the tower event itself is off-stage and could feel like convenient backdrop; the dome’s fracture and hesitating raiders keep pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory layering—ballast scent, petal thickness, dusk-pink opening times—feels purposeful and biases attention botanically. The dome crack and sandbag scrap constrain later choices (hesitation at threshold, seed-weighting), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean across terraces; geography stable. A half-sentence lapse into “color so pale it trembled on the edge of visibility” edges toward purple but stops short of muddling logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes (continuity vs. local warlord entropy) are signaled in paragraph 1 and tighten through repetitive visitor tests: hunters expect vengeance, raiders expect fortress—both confront engraved quiet instead. Each interaction strips Mara’s options (no hired guns, no fortification) while raising reputational risk; cost is visible in her shoulders’ ache and the dome’s fracture. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal, coherent under chosen lens; one meaningful intensification suffices.</answer>

<question>5</question><<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from plant-taught values rather than assertion; the final charged image answers the chaos-vs-continuity question without moralizing. Subtext operates in thorn-angle reading and scent-memory, inviting reflection on non-violent inheritance. No late symbolic grafts; “engraved quiet” is seeded early, paid off in last line. Complexity acknowledged—some hunters laugh, some listen—avoiding false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Vocal texture is botanically cadenced, rhythm modulates between luxuriant rose lists and clipped report (“she walked them along the rows”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara tastes fear in soil, notices bud timing, never drifts into generic bounty-hunter argot. No dialogue, so no register-mismatch risk; narrative diction stays within botanist-pacifist lexicon. Sentence variety and fragment control heighten pressure in visitor encounters without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers scent, memory, and politics; minimal scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“dust did not settle… over the glass-domed desert rose farm”) is forgiven as atmospheric hyperbole. No paraphrase loops; “engraved quiet” returns as purposeful refrain. Near-perfect copy-editing; one comma splice in “Instead, she greeted them…” could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The pacifist-botanist inheriting bounty-territory via roses is non-obvious and specific; transformation test fails if names change because botanical engraving is premise-locked. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulative vs. causal thriller—paid off in coherent closure. No close echoes of famous scenes; scent-memory archive feels fresh. Conceptual integrity: commits fully to plant-mediated ethics without softening raider conversion into tidy victory.</comment>
