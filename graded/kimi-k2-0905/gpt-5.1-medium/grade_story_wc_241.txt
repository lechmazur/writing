<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s double identity—probability professor daughter of a compulsive gambler—drives every micro-choice: refusing to answer texts, pocketing the contradictions note, writing the counter-line on its reverse. Her “theoretically rebellious” label is embodied when she lets subway graffiti reroute her mood and trajectory, a visible cost paid in delayed hospital arrival. Interiority stays concrete, never therapeutic; her father’s twitching “slot-machine fingers” in sedation crystallize inherited risk without exposition. The final co-written note shows mutual re-stateing of their shared language, earned by prior pattern, with felt cost in her staying despite terrible odds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the daughter’s handwritten reversal (“we stay anyway because staying changes them”) reweights both stakes and the father’s smile of loss-into-richer—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mosaic structure (library → subway → hospital) is taught by 25% and coheres; transitions are legible via rain motif and mirrored note handling. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the inherited gamble-language now applies to cardiac odds, shaping tactics inside the hospital room.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rainwashed library functions as micro-setting ship: wet-wool scent, clover-green tint, and the antique lantern’s mica pane directly constrain the daughter’s decision to linger rather than race to ICU. Subway car interior becomes second micro-setting; etched plastic philosophy literally reroutes her emotional vector, fulfilling 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean—note, phone, cup, plastic line tracked without drift. Weather never decorative: rain streaks windows, turns tunnel lights into “smeared comets,” mirroring internal blur but guiding final forward motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she widen both their perspectives without enabling fresh risk? Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: each found note (library, subway, father’s bedside) tightens the contradiction motif and narrows her option to stay detached. Agency visible when she pens the counter-statement, trading delay for dialogue. Cost legible: she forecloses the safe academic perch and steps into the gamble of caregiving. Coincidence (graffiti “arranged for me”) complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of contradictory messages that secretly coordinate: “lucid contradictions are the only honest ones” vs. “DO NOT DOUBLE DOWN ON SORROW.” No explicit thesis; idea stays implicit in father’s city-wide note experiment and daughter’s counter-inscription. Final image reweights premise: probability language moves from casino tables to cardiac monitors to emotional commitment—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Ambiguity preserved: reader cannot tell if staying will heal or bankrupt them, only that the odds are now shared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice carries academic precision without losing sensorial immediacy: “printer ink, and something sweetly green, like crushed clover.” Perceptual signature sharp—she reads urban space as data set, counts ceiling panels like cards, interprets graffiti p-values. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in library tighten into staccato transit impressions. No head-hopping; unreliability hinted (“I told them I was only theoretically rebellious”) is later tested and paid off when she acts. Compression and elision taught early (“time had split”) and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences perform mood, world, and character (“The library smelled of wet wool, printer ink, and something sweetly green, like crushed clover”). Figurative language selectively deployed; no metaphor piled in high-pressure beats. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous despite multiple “he” figures. Vivid nouns and strong verbs over modifiers. Minor scaffold: “the day… the rain… the sky…” opener trio is purposeful pattern-teaching, not template churn. Closure line “scrubbed but not renewed, a little sad, clover bright” lands crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: casino probability jargon applied to hospital survival curves and graffiti ethnography, making inherited risk feel newly urgent. Subway messages as stochastic street-oracle twist the familiar “city speaks” trope into data-driven superstition. Transformation test pass: swap clover scent or mica lantern and the emotional algebra collapses. Risk—mosaic structure, abstract stake—pays off by crystallizing final image. No close echoes of famous scenes; father-daughter gambling stories exist, but this note-for-note city experiment feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: first sentence identifies her profession and paternity. Development: grading refusal, graffiti translation, counter-note composition—all hinge on her hybrid lens. Closure: her own probability aphorism alters their mutual odds. Cost: professional caution forfeited for emotional stake. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Candle lantern appears first third, facilitates discovery of note, reprises symbolically when she “blows it out” to accept contradiction. Does not return in final image, so caps below 8.5; still shapes middle beat decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Concept anchors every note found and written; changes tactical options (she chooses to write back rather than walk away). Final reprise reweights gamble into shared contradiction. Setup–development–closure all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Trait appears early self-label; tested when she obeys graffiti advice instead of medical duty, proving rebellion is real not theoretical. Cost paid in time and emotional exposure. Swappable wording but function is causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Traverse library→subway→hospital enables each beat; without spatial traverse the notes couldn’t accumulate or pressure mount. However, any city journey could serve, so irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Method introduced early, used twice (reads two messages), shapes emotional route and delays ICU arrival. Mechanics explicit: she treats graffiti as data set. Closure participation implicit in final worldview shift.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Rainwashed library creates unique scent and lantern opportunity, prompting note discovery; no other setting supplies identical sensory overlap. Mid-scene development strong; does not reappear in closure so capped.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><question>6.5</question>
<comment>Timeframe referenced repeatedly, tightening decision urgency (brother’s texts, surgeon timeline). However, no specific countdown alters tactics; functions more as emotional backdrop than clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Motivation stated early, conflicted mid-scene (delay vs. duty), enacted in writing the counter-note. Embodied cost: she sacrifices scholarly detachment. Closure linkage clear in final shared line.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Clover melancholy seeded in first paragraph’s “sweetly green, like crushed clover,” modulates through rainy transit sadness, charges final line “a little sad, clover bright.” Tone shift visible and felt.</comment>
