<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied labor and barbed tenderness are vivid; the final beat—pressing whalebone to ear—crystallizes her contradictory impulses. The old pirate’s status as secondary pressure is clear, but the interior cost of “refusing herself” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the final turn’s ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the island’s reappearance is withheld, yet the harbor’s held breath inside Mara reweights her future options with felt cost. Causal linkage holds under Hybrid lens; the scrimshaw’s transfer and instruction sequence drives the final image without teleporting information.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Harbor pilings, barnacled hulls, and the sublittoral fringe are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; the whalebone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final action. Purple light on sweating pilings mirrors internal twilight without overt symbolism, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s access to her own “true strain”—is signaled early; the pirate’s offer tightens it into a single irrevocable choice at low tide. Escalation is textural: density of myth and bodily memory increases until the bone’s cool weight externalizes the cost, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of finding freedom through embracing repressed violence/strain emerges via tactile particulars rather than statement. Final image of the harbor rising inside her reconfigures the earlier belief that islands don’t vanish—now the self is the movable island—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinctive lyric compression—“each step measured as a tide”—and dock-worker perceptual signature remain stable. Pirate’s gravel-under-waves diction contrasts cleanly; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from harsh surf laugh to hushed listening without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer labor, myth, and body—“carry crates with her hips and shoulders, letting the weight roll through.” One mixed metaphor cluster around “lattices in the sky to swallow every bullet” slightly strains physical logic but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-violence world where softness is mandated yet sharpness migrates into objects and listening is freshly angled. Whalebone-as-key and vanishing island synthesize into a tactile fable without precedent; risk lies in trusting lyric listening as climax, paid off by embodied resonance.</comment>
