<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s “reckless idealist” tag is shown, not told, via the orchard ritual that costs him vitality; the narrator’s guilt is embodied in the hand-on-cloth beat. Both characters evolve—Lio dims, narrator steadies—via causally linked micro-choices. Interiority stays sensory (“air tasted like rust and pomegranates”) rather than diagnostic. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-labeling in “my own soul felt like moth-eaten cloth,” −0.2.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the altar-mouth drinks Lio’s blood and spits out a rearranged narrator; cost is visible in Lio’s aging and the river-wool smell. Causal lens holds: because narrator places hand → therefore orchard re-stitches identity; because Lio bleeds → therefore he pays. Orientation anchors within 120 words (catacomb orchard, Lio, night). No telegraphing or soft resets.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: root-tangled skulls constrain footing, candle-shadow doubles branches to create watchful pressure. Basalt altar with silver-dust runes later revealed as literal feeding mouth reweights the entire space. Sensory economy—taste of rust/pomegranate, candle hiccup—mirrors emotional corrosion. Environment forces the final sacrifice; without it the bargain fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“become someone who would have watched the water”—is signaled early and tightened when the altar literally drinks the narrator’s guilt. One meaningful escalation: hand-on-card → blood drop → root shiver → identity sift. Price is legible: Lio ages, narrator’s memory rearranges. No reversal overload; single turn sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of witnessing vs. looking away emerges through the riverbank memory and the orchard’s demand for visceral attention; no final moralizing. Subtext resides in the altar’s carved channels—inlaying meaning everywhere—echoing the human urge to pattern guilt into beauty. Final image of Lio “older” and narrator “steadier” reweights the premise without abstract statement. Complexity remains: compassion is both救赎 and predation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a metallurgical edge—verbs like “trammel,” nouns like “basalt,” rhythms that bite—matching subterranean tension. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly with narrator. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“I felt something sift”). Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“Not a fool… a beginning”). Psychic distance compresses under altar flare without syntactic collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and ingress, avoiding template cadence; information density high—one line often does scent, metaphor, and plot (“candles hiccuped wax down their sides”). Metaphors stay physically coherent (roots “trammeling” bones like rocks). One mixed image—“dusk of wax and stone”—abstracts slightly, −0.2. No loops or scaffold; opening and final lines are stark and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underground Pomona feeding on regret via tarot-infused orchard is new. Ritual mechanics grow from character need rather than lore dump. Transformation test fails if relocated—setting is inseparable from stakes. Risk in lyric compression pays off: single scorched tarot card becomes soul conduit. No derivative premise penalty; mythic horticulture feels inevitable, not gimmicked.</comment>
