<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tomas’s quietly missionary empathy is shown through tactile micro-choices: retrieving the charred letter, offering it, translating vineyard lore into marital metaphor. Interiority stays concrete—“clothes seem too thin for the rising chill” carries her state without label-speak. The final “rhyme vs. overlap” insight is earned because the letter fragment and her lateness have already tested the idea onstage. Cost is visible: he acknowledges he will keep guarding strangers, forfeiting his own bus-ready escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the station’s held breath after the woman decides to stay and try again; the cost is Tomas’s renewed solitude, felt as he “keeps watch” while she walks back toward the road. Causal lens holds throughout: the letter fragment triggers the parallel he draws, which reframes her lateness from failure to poetic rhyme. Orientation is clean inside 120 words: “vacant station,” “vineyard sentinel,” “autumn,” “last bus gone.” No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise without explanatory speech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, rusting railings, and hillside mist constrain movement and mood; the bench becomes a confession box. Vineyard rows supply the central metaphor that crystallizes the closure. Sensory triage is POV-driven: he smells “crushed thyme and old perfume” on ash, not a generic fall checklist. The autumn light physically bisects Tomas’s face, externalizing his mediator role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—missed departure as emblem of relational mismatch—is signaled in the title-grade opening. One meaningful tightening: the burning letter under the bench turns abstract regret into a tactile test; when she smears soot, the option to dismiss the moment forecloses. Cost is legible: she decides to return, accepting future lateness risk; he accepts renewed exile. Agency is mutual, not solved by luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through recurring transport and ripening metaphors rather than thesis lines. The bus timetable vs. grape harvest reframes romantic timing as agricultural, not moral. Subtext sits in gesture—Tomas never says “go back,” only offers the letter and metaphor, letting her conclusion feel self-owned. Final image reweights “destined mismatches” into “rhyming lives,” resisting moral while retaining sting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Tomas’s perceptual filter: “taillights fade into the hill mist” is painterly yet rural-worker specific. Syntax lengthens and softens to match persuasive gentleness, then contracts at the laugh “bitter and warm,” mirroring emotional toggle. No head-hop; woman’s interior is inferred solely through sleeve-wiping and suitcase clicks. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with emotional beats; sentence variety avoids template churn. Figurative language is selective—four well-spaced metaphors across 700+ words—each extending vineyard/transport overlap. No mixed metaphors; “wine remembers both” keeps oenological logic. Scaffolding almost absent; only minor near-repeat “almost stayed / almost left” is purposeful echo, not loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rural station agent as lay therapist of romantic timing, using viticulture parables. Premise is familiar—missed bus, burnt love letter—but vineyard ripening as answer to marital timing feels non-obvious. Risk in quiet stakes is rewarded because pressure stays coherent. Could swap names with minor edits, but vineyard-specific knowledge and “rhyme vs. unison” insight anchor it.</comment>
