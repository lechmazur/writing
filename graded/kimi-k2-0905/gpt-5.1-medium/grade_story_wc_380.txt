<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern-lighter’s interiority is concrete and haunting—his father’s coffee-ground auguries feel inherited in his bones. His micro-choice to pour coffee onto the salt tray is a visible wager that re-configures his stance. Embodied emotion (“my chest had been filled with wet sand”) sustains pressure. The final endurance—watching stunned-fish memories circle—accepts cost without softening his flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cup-to-crystal transfer reweights the entire memory-drain premise with undeniable cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each extinguished lantern and salt blur thickens the same atmospheric rule. Pattern taught by 25% (lantern/snuff ⇄ gravity trough) holds cleanly. Final image crystallizes options: he can now “exhume” memories, but only at the price of drowning in their gravity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor’s moon-slivered whale, the warehouse’s glass trays, and the father’s cracked cup are not backdrop—they are gravity wells that constrain every beat. The salt chamber’s “clean sting of mineral air” is felt in lungs before it’s seen. Micro-setting (the cup’s porcelain edge, the crystal’s crooked tide-marks) charges the final transfer. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock to tray to spiral vision—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memories—tightens when each failed lantern marks another lost day. Escalation is textural: density of forgetting increases until the protagonist risks his own mind to brew the coffee reading. Cost is visible: slowed breath, wet-sand chest, stunned-fish memories that could swallow him. The final spiral forecloses easy recovery; the price of seeing is becoming part of the drain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific images: extinguished lanterns = private nights, salt crystals = memory sediments, coffee grounds = tide marks of forgetting. No moral is stated; the final spiral of half-lived days is the non-literal answer. Subtext resides in silence—neighbors’ stalled conversations, the whale’s blind watch. The reconfiguration makes remembering as lethal as forgetting, refusing tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: light “folded inward,” darkness “blooming,” memory “tugged by hidden tides.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure—single-clause sentences when breath slows. Compression (“I had no shovel for the mind”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; diction stays within the dock-worker’s plausible lexicon while reaching for cosmic metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lyrical spiral clauses to staccato gasps, mirroring tightening air. Metaphors remain physically coherent—light swallowed by gravity pockets, salt climbing itself. No synonym loops; each noun is specific (taper, slurry, prisms). Only hairline slip: “gleaming silence” is repeated twice; the echo is purposeful but fractionally dulls the final line’s freshness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The whale-as-memory-plug and salt-crystal-exhumement synthesize maritime fabulism with cognitive noir—fresh without gimmickry. Inherited coffee-ground divination becomes a scientific instrument for memory archaeology, transforming folk trope into cosmic stakes. Specificity grounds risk: the father’s cracked cup, the cod-warehouse-turned-lab. Without these exact items the repricing collapses; their irreplacability makes the concept feel inevitable.</comment>
