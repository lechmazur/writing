<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s serial self-reinvention is dramatized through micro-choices (slipping on “the weary archivist” under flashlight beams) and embodied cost (Lio’s trembling fingers, the floorboard that “swells slightly as if breathing”). Interior contradiction is vivid—“I tell him the coffee tin will stop me” while already half-shedding the prophet skin. The ledger of past selves in Lio’s head externalizes memory, anchoring motivation without exposition. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling—“Tonight I am mostly made of splintered hope and cigarette paper”—that momentarily abstracts the fracture instead of enacting it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the patrol withdraws, the tin is lifted, the fracture reopens toward light—cost felt in the swallowed breath under the officer’s boot. Causal chain holds: because they archive poems, because the roof is gone, because the city wants silence, they hide the tin; therefore the night can resume. The orientation gate is waived: disorientation (who, where, when withheld until paragraph 3) is taught early and paid off when the same rusted stacks become the site of risk. One ellipsis: how the tin’s manifestos actually reach sleepless citizens is implied not shown, but the gap is compressed by lyric pattern, not causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is no backdrop; its missing roof funnels moonlight and rain onto the page-press, forcing the candle-stub workaround and the hiding of the tin under a swollen floorboard. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: starlight silvers the rafters, boots crunch glass, the metal lid remembers letters—each detail either enables tactics or tightens risk. Spatial choreography is clean: patrol beams cut between stacks, Lio crouches left, narrator right, floorboard center. One micro-drag: “contraband birds” metaphor is vivid but slightly recycled from earlier “contraband secrets,” blunting freshness by a hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the words alive—tightens when boots enter the courtyard; the tin’s concealment becomes a live fork: surrender the archive or risk arrest. Escalation is situational: external pressure crystallizes internal stance; coincidence (patrol route) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visceral: Lio’s shaky hands, the officer’s casual verdict—“this place should be bulldozed”—make loss legible. One missed beat: we never see a runner actually plaster a poem, so the “blooming resistance” is more asserted than tested; still, the tin’s survival re-weights options under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific object: a coffee tin that counterfeits loose change while smuggling language—beauty minted from worthlessness. No moral is stated; instead the image of the floorboard “breathing” under the officer’s boot reprises the idea that texts can be living contraband. The refusal to ossify identity—“I molt monthly”—mirrors the city’s refusal to let any official story harden, keeping ambiguity alive without false equivalence. Final resonance: the fracture toward light is both personal (next self) and civic (next poem), answering the core question without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinctive perceptual signature: counting “borrowed names on ink-stained fingers,” sensing the library as “a skeleton of shelves and wind.” Syntax flexes with risk—“a luminous fracture walking”—without abandoning clarity. Compression is taught early and paid off: “penny poet” is re-priced in the final line when the metal lid is lifted toward starlight. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal lexicon stays inside the narrator’s plausible register of salvage and splinter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the drip of rain through the open roof” does triple duty—setting, stakes, metronome. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“molts personalities monthly like a snake abandons skins”—and never cluster in a single beat. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric runs (“Back then… Now…”) collapse into staccato under flashlight beams. One paraphrase ripple: “beauty did not have to be gentle to be holy; it could snarl” borders thematic assertion, but the next sentence re-embodies it through action, neutralizing the slip before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses familiar tropes—post-riot archive, outlaw poets—into a fresh angle: the printing press is a disguised coin tin, resistance is measured in illegible cents. Specificity carries originality: coffee tin false-bottom mechanics, ledger of selves kept by a friend, poems pressed “hard enough that the metal remembers them.” Transformation test fails if relocated: only this half-roof prison library lets rain smear ink into contraband birds. Risk—lyric montage over plot—is rewarded because the final image of reopened fracture cannot happen without the exact tin, roof, moonlight triad.</comment>
