<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iri’s quietly subversive mechanic-mind is vivid—her gaze “wandered like a calmly inventive mechanic appraising a broken engine” shows embodied, character-specific perception. Interior contradiction is active: loyalty to post vs. resolve to rewrite the fort’s story. The micro-choice to slot copper rods into hidden sockets converts bureaucratic props into lock-picking teeth, enacting her “silent revolution” with tactile risk. Cost is visible: the fort’s locks “forgot which side was inside,” foreclosing her old identity without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambiguous-at-start blackout is taught as opportunity by line 6; orientation anchors (who=Iri, where=western gate tower, when=twilight blackout) land by ~80 words, well inside limit. Causal chain holds: flickering beacon → unguarded moment → sundial cipher → rod insertion → lock amnesia; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s security logic flips, felt cost in the final image—“locks forgot which side was inside.” No teleporting props or causality breaks; sundial cipher payoff justifies early elision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous fort with “bottled daylight” walls is sketched in two swift strokes yet continuously pressures choice—darkness grants Iri her window. Micro-setting objects—bronze quill holder, copper rods, half-painted sundial—function as terrain: rods re-wire gatework, sundial delivers cipher. Sensory selection is POV-driven: Iri notices “winking hush,” “smoky bruise” tint, the hum of gears “clearing their throats.” Final image of disoriented locks is charged by these prior environmental specifics, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seize the blackout to rewrite the fort’s story—signalled in first third. Escalation is one tightening: blackout → cipher → rod act → lock amnesia; each step raises exposure and irreversibility. Cost is legible: her identity as loyal sentinel is forfeited when locks forget inside/outside. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (blackout) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of institutional control vs. quiet subversion emerges through circuitry imagery and lock reversals, never stated. Subtext resides in objects: quill holder meant for ink becomes socket for rods; sundial meant for time becomes cipher channel. Final image reweights premise—security apparatus turned ambiguous—without moralizing. Particulars (copper teeth, coded rays) carry universal resonance on power and narrative revision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays strictly inside Iri’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Voice texture is mechanically poetic—“bottled daylight,” “step spool,” “frightened compass”—matching her inventor lens. Rhythm compresses under pressure: short clauses during rod insertion heighten immediacy. Dialogue (only Trann) carries indirection and subtext, distinct from narrative syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does description, character, and foreshadowing—“Its outer walls shimmered with bottled daylight, yet the corridors inside kept a winking hush.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (engine=fort, compass=sundial) and do not collide. Variation in sentence length and paragraphing mirrors tension; final line lands with ominous cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortress-as-light-source + mechanic-sentinel + lock-picking poetry feels inevitable yet unseen. Resistance method via half-painted sundial angles is a deliciously specific espionage device. Risk taken—compressed lyric narration—pays off in closure clarity. Conceptual integrity sustained; world rules never softened for convenience.</comment>
