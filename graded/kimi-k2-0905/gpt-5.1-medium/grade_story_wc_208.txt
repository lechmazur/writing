<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—wind “yanking,” sand “stinging like reprimands”—and her driftwood sculptor identity filters every perception. The slide-triggered self-cameo gives a hair-raising jolt of earned irony, yet her decision to “invite strangers” is announced, not dramatized, so the hinge feels slightly under-costed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch becomes map-center, engine hum turns mantra, cost felt in “no blue line to follow.” Causal chain holds: dead GPS → stop → find slide → see self → reorient life. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by line 5; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but navigation instrument: its throat shapes her new cartography. Driftwood tangle altar, salt-and-burned-sugar smell, lantern slide crusted with barnacles—tactile specificity every paragraph. Micro-setting (the slide glass) literally refracts her future, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—artist’s search for meaning after tech failure—tightens when slide shows her among time-braided strangers, foreclosing passive driftwood hunt. Escalation is situational: weather worsens, but internal pressure (seen-self paradox) drives the turn. Cost legible: she forfeits passive scavenging for active stewardship of alliances.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as collaboration across time—emerges from image, not lecture: driftwood ribs crossing seaweed mirrors generations’ hands almost touching. Final image of engine hum repeating “she could be lost and learning” reweights earlier failure into purpose, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic, turbine-thick, with percussive verbs (“hurled,” “punched,” “yanking”). Perceptual signature consistent—Mara notices textures, joints, weathered curves. Syntax breathes with weather: long clauses swell, then cut to fragments under shock of self-sighting. No head-hopping; lyric elision taught early (“slipping into…reverie”) and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “tide had thrown up a tangled altar” does three jobs in nine words. Only micro-loop: “blue line ran out of map and into blank gray sea” echoes the same idea twice; single −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>New angle: GPS apocalypse births analog time-map. Slide-as-portal trope is refreshed by driftwood sculptor’s material lens and self-insertion. Risk—lyric accumulation over plot—mostly succeeds because closure re-anchors abstraction to engine sound.</comment>
