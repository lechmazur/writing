<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lark’s interior contradiction—whimsical sidewalk artist thrust into sacred duty—peaks when she presses the shard into sand and trades her “harmless” art for a tool that steals whispers; the cost (her former artistic innocence) is felt but not yet embodied in a single body cue. The boy’s grief supplies external pressure, yet his function is more catalyst than crucible; we never see his sketchbook again, so the relationship’s state-change is implied not dramatized. Micro-choice sequence—finger-smudge, kneel, draw—tracks values cleanly, earning the renunciation. Still, the chalk tin “sweating” never recurs as sensory anchor, missing a chance to embody fear under escalation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lark realizes the grotto’s mess demands outline, not erasure; the tile flake pressed into mandala sand makes the cost visible and irreversible. Causal chain holds—because she lifts the shard, the hush re-flavors and she re-sees her art as weapon/tool; therefore she kneels and draws. Orientation is taught early (mist, pit, pilgrims) and anchors by word 80, waiving any penalty. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no seams or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s lilac mist and dripping ceiling constrain acoustics and sightlines, forcing Lark to move “as if adjusting her satchel” to approach the boy—setting actively shapes stealth tactics. The tile flake itself functions as micro-setting: its grit against thumb, its ceramic cool, its later burial in sand all alter her next physical choice. Sensory hierarchy favors hush-over-visual, matching the emergent rule; no static postcard catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across 360° pilgrims and pit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lark use her art to weaponize/listen or preserve innocence—tightens once: shard in hand → draw in sand, foreclosing option to stay merely a sidewalk decorator. Cost is conceptual (innocence lost) rather than visceral; absence of bodily price keeps score sub-8.8. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word window; coincidence never rescues. Agency is decision, not antagonist battle, fitting situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as framing rather than erasing trauma—emerges through the mandala’s smear-and-outline duality, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: chalk smudge on finger = complicity, shard buried = listener’s burden. Final image of “every stolen whisper pick[ing] a color” reweights earlier “whimsical dragons” without moral tag. Resists tidy uplift; ambiguity lingers about cost to pilgrims.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays inside Lark’s perceptual filter—“chalks sweated,” “spirals of arguments”—syntax mirrors artist who sees patterns everywhere. No head-hopping; boy’s grief is externally observed. Rhythm accelerates into fragment “Losing my brother” to match breath-catch moment. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Compression like “lilac unease” is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences deliver sensory data, metaphor, and causality—“shard cool and gritty against her thumb” anchors object + physiology + next steal. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphor vehicles (oxidize, gnaw) stay coherent within corrosive motif. Final line “every stolen whisper pick a color” propels outward without overwriting. Minor near-slip: “emergent hush changed flavor” repeats noun/verb pairing but pattern is purposeful, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk graffiti meets Tibetan sand-mandala demolition in underground whisper-gallery—specific, non-obvious, yet inevitable once plated. Risk of “artist listens cave to therapy” is overcome by theft of sacred shard and repurposing of mandala as canvas for others’ secrets. Pilgrims as half-erased profiles turns crowd into literal sketchpad. Transformation test passes: swap artist medium or ritual and whole frame collapses.</comment>
