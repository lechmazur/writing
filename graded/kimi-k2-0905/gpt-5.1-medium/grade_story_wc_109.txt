<comment>The oracle’s quiet-mapping obsession is dramatized through tactile beats—gold flakes on fingers, palm-pressed booklet—so her interior contradiction (duty vs. dread of voiceless dark) lives in gesture, not label. The captain’s etched face and shadow-counting habit crystallize a man converting fear into inventory, giving the relationship a status tilt that flips when he accepts her silent chart. Micro-choices (opening the booklet under leaking rain, lifting the finished map toward blackness) cost them the last visual tether, so the renunciation feels earned. Only the captain’s late emotional ventriloquism (“What will your map show us…”) drifts into explanatory speech, keeping the score just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the starless moment reconfigures navigation from celestial to auricular, and the cost—total relinquishment of external light—hits on the final line. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added silence (storm, gate creak, dying star) layers density until the map becomes shelter, a pattern taught early and paid off when the hall stays dry. Causality is intact—oracle summoned because charts will fail, map drawn because silence accumulated, captain yields because map offers dark grammar. No lens ambiguity, no orientation debt; the hinge of infinite night is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<comment>The ridge fort’s broken hinges and rain-slick drum-table constrain posture and tool use; bodies must tilt, pages must be flattened, so setting actively shapes the only possible choreography. The flaking gold booklet evolves from cargo to lamp to compass, its material fragility dictating why the map must be finished now—flakes lost cannot be reclaimed. One-star clock and marbled hush function as micro-settings that compress scale and force interior attention, charging the final image when darkness swallows walls yet leaves gilt outlines. Environmental mirroring (storm = internal dread) is present but subordinated to utilitarian pressure, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—how to navigate existence once celestial reference dies—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the last star gutters. Escalation is textural: each added silence thickens the air until refusal to listen becomes impossible; the decisive deepening is the captain’s acceptance of dark grammar, cost paid by surrendering every visual certainty. No external reversals are needed; the pressure coil is the accumulating quiet itself. The price (perpetual night, voice as only compass) is legible and shapes the closing stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without announcement: knowledge migrates from eye to ear, from chart to hush, from empire to individual body. The map’s silence-grammar reframes loss as methodology, culminating in the non-literal answer that darkness is traversable if one learns its syntax. No final-paragraph thesis states this; the image of two silhouettes limned by their own broken gold suffices. Counter-reading remains open—is the map salvation or delusion?—yet the emotional aftereffect (dread tempered by companionship) lands cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through the oracle’s perceptual filter—sound weights, silence has direction—so diction stays within her plausible lexicon of acoustic cartography. Syntax lengthens and relaxes during map-creation, then fractures into staccato when the star dies, mirroring attention collapse without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors (rain “gnaw,” star “snuffed like a candle”) are sparse, purposeful, and consistent with maritime fort idiom. Voice distinction is less sharp in the captain’s single speech block, but interior access never wavers.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries oral rhythm—variation in sentence openers, purposeful enjambment, no template cadence—while information density remains high: one sentence often delivers sensory detail, emotional tilt, and world rule. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; “marbled hush,” “ambered hush” reuse is pattern-taught and paid off. Minor scaffold appears only in the echo of “nothing left to…” twice in quick succession, but the second instance is reframed by the oracle’s reply, so momentum sustains. Closure beat is free of figurative muddle, letting the final line resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of cartographing silence as a mariner’s tool after astral collapse feels non-obvious yet inevitable under Accumulative logic. Risk is taken by centering a static scene inside an oncoming void rather than external action, and it pays off through lyric intensity. Familiar tropes (storm-battered fort, last star) are re-animate via acoustic navigation and gold-leaf fragility, so they read specific, not recycled. The synthesis of sea-myth and sensory inversion offers fresh inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
