<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s obsession with 713 and the archive’s ghosts is anchored in concrete micro-choices—spoofing an audit, pinning the patch, writing the illegal query. Interiority is consistent and character-specific; the final renunciation (closing the interface) costs him certainty and safety, earned by the trail of small rebellions. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate is barely missed.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s “buried subnet” reweights the meaning of deletion and of Ora’s vanishing. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each 713 echo tightens the pattern until silence itself becomes a coordinate. Cost is legible in the final line: “I closed the interface, knowing…”—knowledge that bars him from innocence. The inferred lens is taught early and paid off without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The chilled racks, black-square time-gap, and 7:01:03 silences are specific, sensory, and filtered through the POV’s tech-ritual gaze. The archive’s humming choir and “commercial jingles” tether mood to theme. Environment directly constrains the final move—only the archive’s paradox-loving logic allows silence-as-content to yield coordinates. One notch off only because spatial choreography of the Deep Cold gateway is implied rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find Ora/find where deleted files go—tightens when 713 graduates from glitch to map. Each recurrence is an Accumulative beat that raises conceptual cost: the system itself may be complicit. The final silence-tag forces the protagonist’s illegal query; agency is continuous. Cost is unmistakable on the page: eternal exile from comfortable ignorance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: digital afterlife as forced choir, deletion as colonial disappearance. The patch’s “deliberate silence” and Ora’s humane-design obsession reweight the moral calculus—some crashes are escapes. Final image of chosen exile reframes the archive from cathedral to prison. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance is carried by the silenced playlist and the narrator’s acceptance of complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct—tech-poet hybrid with lexicon of “checksum tails,” “cold vault,” “social credit.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for archive grandeur, staccato for glitch sightings. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Corporate diction is motivated and consistent, never drifts into brochure-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new info or image. Metaphors are controlled—“choir forced to sing commercial jingles”—and never mixed. High density: “black square of time across the echo of forgotten songs” does three jobs. No artifact touches closure; final line is crisp, propulsive, unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: haunted data-center + missing-person noir + humane-interface ethics. 713 pattern turns a tech-superstition into navigational star map. Risky choice to make silence the clickable link is fully grounded in earlier design philosophy. Could not swap patch, subnet, or jingle-choir for generics without collapse.</comment>
