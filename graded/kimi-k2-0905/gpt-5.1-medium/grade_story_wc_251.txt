<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Daniel’s quiet, chess-logic obsession feels lived-in; his “forests of second thoughts” motivation is stated early and re-iterated in embodied action (mapping town to board, phoning shops). Interiority stays sparse but specific—he “hears” unspoken words as rustling leaves—never slipping into therapy-speak. The micro-choice to cradle the leaf crystallizes his hierarchy of values and previews the later window-gambit; the renunciation of overt protest carries visible social cost in the muted ending. Milo remains a functional echo rather than a second full character, so relationship crucible pressure is light; head-count stays within bounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the council balcony glimpse of the “vast forest” of windows re-weights the town’s perceived options, and two anonymous votes flip—cost is felt in the hush that follows. Causal chain holds: leaf-crade → map-as-chessboard → window-campaign → vote shift; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who=coach, where=school→library, when=after buses leave). One minor scaffold: “unspoken words” motif is stated more than demonstrated in early beats, but pattern pays off at climax and lens (Situational/Accumulative hybrid) stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective, not touristic: cobalt library mist, magnetic grotto iron-veins, low-hovering dusk fog—each returns to constrain or charge action (compass tug, window light sharpness). Spatial choreography is crisp across the single evening campaign. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-true: Daniel notices angles, windows, chessboard symmetries; bakery= c4 anchors the scheme. The “forests of second thoughts” image re-weights the final balcony view, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor tick: “Maple Street” named once and never re-used, but it never matters to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the hillside woods—signalled by paragraph 4 and tightened exactly once: the synchronized window display gambit forecloses the easier path of overt protest. Cost is legible: shop-owners risk civic disapproval, Daniel risks failure in front of his students. Agency stays internal but active—every phone call and map annotation advances the window plot. Coincidence (early fog) complicates rather than resolves. The vote flip is partial, leaving the town in “different future” tension—enough for 600-word scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet, almost invisible resistance can reroute public choice. No character sermonizes; the final image of “leaflike” unspoken words breathing beyond hearing re-prices the premise. Motif of hearing silence threads through library hush, magnetic grotto fog, and the amplified quiet after the vote—each recurrence accrues rather than decorates. Ambiguity is preserved: two council members “without quite knowing why” keeps moral calculus open.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Daniel’s perceptual signature: compass tugs, chessboard sight-lines, auditory metaphor of rustling lockers. Syntax lengthens and breathes with dusk mist, then shortens during phone-call sprint—rhythm serves pressure. No head-hop; Milo’s thoughts are inferred only through Daniel’s ears. Diction stays within a mild-mannered coach’s lexicon; “amplified quiet” refrain is purposeful pattern, not monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: “bakery c4, post office e5” compresses campaign logistics into a single clause. Mixed metaphors avoided; “forests of second thoughts” is extended, not swapped. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph’s “leaflike” reprise is crisp, propulsive, and charges closure. One minor scaffold: “unspoken words” phrase appears four times—acceptable under pattern-teach rule.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The chess-board-as-city-grid conceit freshens the eco-protest trope; window-display “broadcast” is a non-obvious, gentle escalation that feels inevitable after the leaf-cradle moment. Magnetic grotto under starlight gives the town a singular fingerprint. Risk-taking (quiet而非横幅 rebellion) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. All elements synthesize into one stance: refusal to shout can still checkmate.</comment>
