<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s collector-archivist identity is vivid and embodied—salt sleeves, labeled satchel, walking “staggered intervals” as ritual. Her interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the moment she pockets the valve, the chill on her wrist shows internal contradiction between duty and fear of false hope. Caven’s step-forward is credible because his exile was dramatized earlier; the throat-scar detail pays off when the first tentative note is thin. Cost is present but slight: the city’s absences “begin to navigate themselves,” a conceptual rather than viscerally felt price, keeping the renunciation just shy of full 8-band punch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Charged Poise: Caven’s tremulous note reconfigures the harbor’s silence into an unsure question, reweighting every prior gap. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marae’s fragment-compiling ritual cumulatively summons the crowd and Caven; no single cause but pattern density tightens. Orientation is clean by line 6; the ivory/missing-teeth metaphors teach the bruised-retreat disorientation that later pays off. Cost is conceptual—music now dare exist again—but felt in the collective wince of that “unsure music”; sufficient for 8-band, though not the visceral forfeiture that would push 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Harbor as micro-setting is relentless: damp boards soak Mara’s skirt, salt spray lines her satchel, the brass valve’s chill brands her wrist. Weather shift from “post-storm sharpness” to “expectant muddle” tracks the crowd’s emotional barometer, constraining when hope can surface. The ivory/rain/bone imagistic set recurs and finally recharges when the trumpet’s tarnished brass becomes a “small sun” exactly where bone-white light hits. Spatial choreography is clean: ten-pace intervals, bollard placement, crowd drift—no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake = can the exile’s silence be turned back into shared music? Pressure escalates through pattern, not plot reversal: each unclaimed object Mara presents enlarges the collective risk of permanent absence. The single tightening arrives when Caven lifts the valve—if the note fails, the silence calcifies. Agency is mostly Mara’s curatorial patience; Caven’s final breath supplies the decisive micro-turn whose failure would cost the city its last herald. Cost is legible but conceptual; lacks a tangible loss (object, relationship, flesh) that would punch into 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme—absence as necessary precursor to reassembled meaning—emerges purely through Mara’s map of blank rectangles and the crowd’s slow straightening, never sermonized. Subtext hums in object silences: valve that once blasted refusal now quivers at welcome. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: the unsure note is not victory but permission for future song. Complexity lingers: no guarantee the music will take, only that silence has been conceptually repriced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Mara’s perceptual biases—she reads the harbor between heartbeats, notices salt-damp before color. Psychic distance modulates: compresses to tool-in-hand chill, widens to crowd-as-organism without head-hop. Rhythm scales with tension: longer clauses during catalog, fragment sentences when valve is lifted. No dialogue, so voice carries through diction like “herald’s trumpet valve” that feels technical yet archaic, fitting Mara’s archivist ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Ear-test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Density high—single sentences layer image, stakes, and sensory anchor (“brass tube no longer than her palm, its fittings blackened but its shape unmistakable”). One mixed metaphor bruised sky / polished bone is allowed because it recurs and pays off. No scaffold loops; “staggered intervals” repeats deliberately to teach ritual cadence. Register stable—no drift into academic abstraction. The final “unsure music” line is crisp, propulsive closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Premise—post-exile archivist who maps negative space—feels fresh against flooded return narratives. Synthesis of maritime detritus catalog with musical silence avoids quirky ornament; each fragment is social evidence. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure is rewarded when the first tentative note becomes the loudest possible event. Transformation test fails if swapped: only this harbor’s specific history of Caven’s banishment makes the valve politically volatile.</question>
