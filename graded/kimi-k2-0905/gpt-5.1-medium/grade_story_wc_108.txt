<comment>The stunt-double’s terror is lived-in: her breath kinks, her hands won’t steady, she names each fear like a wound she’s memorized. The child’s cipher-cast gives her a micro-choice—write TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS—that externalizes the contradiction between flight and fight. Interiority toggles between visceral symptom and reflective map without slipping into therapy-speak. The ending stance is earned: she weaponizes trembling itself, a renunciation of studio invincibility that costs her borrowed identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she will walk into the office shaking, holding her bruised résumé like a protest sign. The before/after is legible—studio erasure → self-authored visibility—and the cost is felt in the same breath that names it. Causal chain holds: erased file → library exile → cipher decryption → stance crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rusted library under stars we used for night shoots”); no ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rusted library is no postcard: metal ribs orange with decay, plastic-wrapped books like cadavers, a seashell wired to hiss when wind slips through girder holes—every detail is tactile and stakes-contingent. The body-as-micro-setting appears when her “body kinks around fear like a wire around a magnet,” a literal constraint that later enables her to weaponize the same tremor. Spatial choreography is clean: boy limps in, nurse exits, table becomes shared altar; no impossible positions. Final image recharges the shell’s fake tide as synchronized breath, environment forcing stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—existential visibility—tightens when the cast list rewrites her name. The boy’s cipher provides the single deepening: each crossed-out fear (FALL, FIRE, ALONE) paired with a self-gifted answer reweights her option set. Agency is visible: she writes the final trust-couplet, then chooses to carry her shaking body into the office as ratings leverage. Cost is on-page: forfeiture of manufactured invincibility, embrace of trembling as commodity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: vulnerability as renewable power source, not moral. The shell’s fake tide and the child’s plaster loops are particulars that accumulate into a conceptual repricing—studio illusionism vs. corporeal authenticity. No abstract declaration; final image is protest sign made of bruised skin. Ambiguity lingers: will ratings greed validate or devour her? That uncertainty is thematic engine, not flaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is stunt-double specific: cinematic jargon fused with phobia cartography—“kinked wire,” “stunt mark on the floor.” Rhythm mirrors breath: long, image-crammed sentences collapse into fragment blocks as panic spikes. No head-hop; perceptual signature stable—she hears ocean noise in a shell she knows is patched to a speaker. Child’s dialogue credibly terse, scribbled cast as proxy voice; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence does three jobs—e.g., “plastic sealed like organs in jars” fuses setting, metaphor, POV bias. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor is single, coherent, paid off. Peak beat—“I would walk into the production office shaking”—is plain diction, no purple override. Read-aloud ear varies cadence; paragraph cuts are surgical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double identity horror cross-bred with children’s injury-cipher as code-breaking manual for self-reinvention. Studio-as-panopticon trope is re-grounded in call-sheet bureaucracy and burned-file erasure. Risk taken: lyric escalation inside a decaying soundstage library; coherence retained. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious—vulnerability monetized as audience mirror, not hero armor.</comment>
