<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iren’s “serene anger” is embodied, contradictory, and anchors every beat; the memory of his frozen mother inside the ink vision converts backstory to present cost. Micro-choice—fingertips on cooling ink while “sense of self loosens”—earns the vanishing act. No status crucible (elders observe, don’t oppose), so relationship bullet not triggered. Interiority avoids diagnostic speak; “time does not slow; consciousness widens its eye” is perception, not TED talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Iren’s decision to let self “loosen” reweights the world’s editorial cuts and costs him coherent identity. Causal chain holds: eclipse→ink demo→epiphany→voluntary vanishing; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern of “skipped frames” taught early and paid at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment, bone-hole tents, boiled-cactus smell, and Painted Table are selective, tactile, and steer action (ink spilled on stained history). Micro-setting qualifies: the table’s surface literally channels the demonstration and final choice. Hummingbird drone doubles as both tool and atmospheric mirror, charging the final image. No 9-band gate failure; environment constrains the vanishing method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the pattern of the cuts”—signaled early; tightening occurs when ink vision proves world edits itself, forcing Iren to accept vanishing as tactic. Cost visible: surrender of stable identity on the page (“let his sense of self loosen”). No external antagonist, but internal want-vs-fear (track truth vs. erase self) supplies coherent pressure. Meets 8.8+ gate for visible price that charges final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: consciousness as editorial sieve that deletes boredom but also erases people. Final image reframes earlier eclipse and mother’s death as same cosmic cut. Subtext in Kesh’s frantic loops and elders’ still hands implies complicity without sermon. No moralizing line; resonance carried by ink hoofprint and Iren’s vanishing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually distinct: “whining in the bone-holes,” “tasted of oil,” “bruised memory of the eclipse” are idiosyncratic, not generically poetic. Syntax mirrors tracker mindset—clausal, observational, then compresses at vanish beat. No dialogue to distort. Register stable; no corporate or academic drift. Pattern of metaphor (ink=editorial cuts) taught and paid off without muddle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density lines carry triple duty: “ink shivered, reflecting not the tent roof but the bruised memory of the eclipse outside.” Rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop mild: “time does not slow…consciousness widens…” echoing elder, but serves thematic clarity. No artifact touches closure; final sentence propels without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Treats time-dilation trope as cosmic film-editing; disappearance via ink patterns is fresh synthesis. Albino tracker born “half-vanished” literalizes marginal identity into plot function. Risky second-person invitation to reader at end (“you are here”) avoided, keeping stance consistent. Specifics (prayer-bell drone, cactus steam) could not swap into another story without collapse.</comment>
