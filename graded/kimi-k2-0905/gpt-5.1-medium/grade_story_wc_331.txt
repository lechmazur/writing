<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mariel’s “sanely eccentric” label is shown through concrete ritual (receipt-maps, star-marked pauses) and a quiet hierarchy of values—cataloging hesitation matters more than sleep or safety. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens; no therapy-speak. The final stance—renouncing the need for a physical locus—carries cost (her diagrams collapse into “a posture of attention”), satisfying earned stasis. Yet the flaw is passivity: she observes, maps, follows, but never risks altering the library in a way that could fail; the climax is recognition, not choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hyperbolic search folds into the simple image of a human body waiting to speak—cost is the obsolescence of her cartographic obsession. Causality holds: every receipt-path leads to the poet’s pause, and that pause is shown, not explained. Orientation is swift: dusk opening, scarf anchor, single POV. One minor loop: “analog memories” is twice defined in adjacent sentences; trim for 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is not backdrop but instrument: aisle names (“planetary sonnets”) steer Mariel’s paths, carpet grain signals memory density, fluorescent hum sets the key of “observed solitude.” The scarf’s fray stands in for years of night shifts, a micro-setting object that returns at closure trailing “like a comet tail,” re-weighted from tool to relic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: left at fiction/fluid-dynamics, right through neutron haiku, stop at unmarked junction—every move legible. Environment constrains the final insight: only that junction’s air-fold yields the collapse of infinite map into single stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the pre-ink origin of story—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens through each star-marked hesitation. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of paused pens increases, air thickens to “cool and grainy,” until the poet’s motionless body collapses the hyperbolic spread into one depth. The price is conceptual—the map’s redundancy—rather than visceral, but it is on-page and felt. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture (job risk, physical drain) sharpens the final cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stories are not containers but events of attention; the library is an amplifier, not a vault. Subtext lives in gesture—poet’s blank notebook, physicist’s integrals—silence as generative friction. Final image reweights earlier motifs: the scarf’s fray now echoes the frayed edge of language itself, a non-literal answer that invites re-reading. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a calibrated distance—close enough to taste “grainy air,” distant enough to note “fond distance of a keeper.” Syntax lengthens during mapping, shortens at the collapse, mirroring hyperbolic expansion/contraction. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Mariel’s cataloguing gaze. Diction stays within her lexicon (“catalog numbers, circulation policies”) without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats: long clause piles for coral-like spread, then a clipped “Here, she realized.” Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One mixed metaphor cluster—“air fold inward, like a fabric pinched... every aisle tugged”—slightly strains physical logic, but the image is brief and closure-clear. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses Borges with topology: a librarian uses hyperbolic geometry to triangulate the ontic birthplace of narrative. Risk is high—abstraction could have collapsed into gimmick—but the piece grounds it in receipt-scribbles, star-marks, and the final human stance. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no swap possible without gutting the arc. Fresh inflection: the library as differential manifold where silence curves toward utterance.</comment>
