<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“my nerves into film… relentless projectors” shows trauma physically. Drumming tic evolves into intentional signal, giving visible agency. Quiet rebellion stays consistent, culminating in perch choice with cost felt in “auroral sorrow.” Could use one more contradictory impulse mid-scene to hit 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open sky where lagoon was crystallizes new collective agency with undeniable cost—population-scale strings cut. Causal chain intact: drumming → mirrored pulses → others’ tide of attention → shared dream pressed outward. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; pattern of entanglement taught early and reweighted at end. Orientation anchored by word 80; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden, auric lagoon, and railing converge to constrain the perch decision; environment literally trembles under choice. Selective sensory layering—subsonic chords translated into gold light—keeps texture without overload. Space stays coherent: pillar → gravel → rail → lagoon → sky replacement. Final image of sky-in-place-of-water reuses prior concrete to reconfigure meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will collective memory break its cage—signals early and tightens when reflection shows overlapped stranger. Drumming escalation turns personal tic into tactical signal, foreclosing passive compliance; cost legible in shared terror that floods back. One deepening suffices for length; could use a sharper tangible loss (e.g., physical bleed or facility alarm) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of engineered collective dreams emerges through concrete beats—tray constellations, dirt circles—never abstract lecture. Final sky-lagoon inversion offers non-literal answer: shared imagination can overwrite imposed reality. Subtext of “quiet rebellions” accrues via drumming code and off-loop walk, paying off in group lean. No moralizing; resonance stays imagistic and open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains perceptual signature—knuckle clicks, gown crack, star-needles—without filter-verb clutter. Compression like “time jittered like bad reception” teaches elision early and stays legible. Rhythm accelerates under stress: short pulses mirror speaker bassline. No head-hopping; lyric slides into shared faces remain anchored to narrator’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—almost every sentence couples image with stakes advancement. Figurative language disciplined: “knot of headphone wires” is exact, not purple. One scaffold spot: “beautiful in the way distant disasters can be” abstracts a beat already shown; minor. No loops, no mixed metaphors, grammar clean. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes memory-merging trope but grounds it in bass-line garden and drumming code, making tech feel organic. Risk of lyric collective POV paid off by holding single-focalizer sensorium until final tide. “Auric lagoon” and “auroral sorrow” reframed from ornamental to tactical—water becomes sky through group refusal. Transformation inevitable in hindsight; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
