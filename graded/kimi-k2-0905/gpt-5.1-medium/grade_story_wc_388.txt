<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theo’s interior contradiction—fame from exposing lies, now hired to certify them—drives every beat; his micro-choices (spade vs. diamond, respirator fog vs. lens clarity) embody the cost of refusing delivery. The final refusal is earned because the shredded-letter reassembly sequence dramatizes his epistemic addiction; the orchard’s starving survivors are the visible price. No head-hop or stock phrasing; only flaw is slight under-embodiment of radioactive fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s template function is revealed, Theo’s refusal reweights the Committee’s governance model, and the orchard’s continued life becomes the cost he accepts. Causal chain intact: letters → diamond → stillpoint protocol → refusal. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: respirator, poisoned roots, and the diamond itself shape tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: radioactive dust narrows perception to “faint geometric scars,” the fused chain physically tethers the dig site, and the diamond’s ice-glass touch crystallizes the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Theo’s investigator bias—UV lamp, notebook, spade—each tool later weaponized. Micro-setting (diamond as portable stillpoint) constrains the closing choice. No exposition dump; world rules discovered through shovel and ultraviolet glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control of the resilience protocol—tightens once: the reconstructed letters convert abstract rumor into actionable blackmail leverage. Escalation is causal: each strip of paper shrinks Theo’s options until only complicity or sabotage remains. Visible price: the orchard will starve survivors if he destroys the diamond; moral arithmetic is legible. Agency drives the turn: his refusal is not nihilistic but data-derived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “truth” as commodity: the same epistemic tools that once dismantled conspiracies now manufacture them. Subtext lives in object handling—diamond scar mirrors fruit scar, template imprint literalizes engineered consensus. Final image of radioactive hush listening refuses to moralize; ambiguity lingers about whether silence is complicity or mercy. No thematic echo spoken aloud; resonance arises from the crystalline stillpoint’s redefinition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is forensic: “notebook in hand, eyes sharply observant behind fogged lenses”—syntax mirrors clipped, evidence-first cognition. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“spade finally struck something that rang like glass”) then widens for the rainbow fracture. No filter-verb stacks; UV lamp does not “seem” to glow, it glows. Diction stays inside Theo’s lexicon—no academic register drift. Voice remains singular even during lyric pause of “radioactive hush.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and propulsion high; information density doubles duty (“gray, irradiated fruit” = color + peril). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Metaphor disciplined—vehicle “veil” for dust stays optical, never drifts. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “listening” motif. Minor −0.1 for two adjective clusters (“crushed, fractured halo”) adjacent; does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: post-apocalyptic orchard as biotech key, conspiracy debunker turned ethical saboteur, diamond as literal firmware. Conceptual integrity commits fully—no retreat to mysticism; cursed rumor is engineering myth. Risk of quiet refusal in wasteland pays off by reweighting governance stakes. Specificity of “geometric scars” on fruit and diamond ridges makes template imprint unforgettable. Transformation test: swap any element and the whole fractures.</comment>
