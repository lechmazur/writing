<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting transparency yet protecting the covenant—drives every beat; her micro-choice to ring the bell rather than expose names crystallizes hierarchy of values. Kito’s embodied fear (sagging box, rice crumbs) and his line “Sleep is for people who are not hungry” compress an entire adolescent biography. The bell’s reappearance as a non-verbal covenant, not exposé, shows earned change with visible cost: the community will keep living the secrecy she once wanted to unravel. Minor slack: Kito’s motivation is stated more than dramatized before the ridge scene.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s bell-ring reweights the anonymous covenant into audible mutual debt—felt cost is the future silence she now protects. Causal lens holds: because donations stayed secret, therefore Mara must protect the secrecy with ritual, narrowing her own options. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”), transitions clean, no prop teleport. One persistent constraint—sanctions-thinned food—shapes every tactic and charges the final image.</comment>

<comment>Terra-cotta tiles become micro-setting: hollow chambers amplify quiet and physically cue the covenant’s secrecy; the arbor’s central post acts as altar for the box and bell. Wind-shift silence at the end recharges earlier tile chime, turning environment into verdict. Sensory selection follows urgency—only moonlit shawl, ink smudges, clinking ceramics survive the night. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving communal survival without fracturing trust—tightens when Mara realizes exposing donors would collapse the food pipeline. One meaningful escalation: her pivot from investigative exposure to ceremonial protection; cost is her relinquished authority over full transparency. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates (wind masking steps). Price is legible: she must live inside the secrecy she despises.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: anonymity not as charity but as intergenerational covenant—old give from memory, young from impatience. Subtext in gesture: bell’s cracked tone = fractured yet persistent peoplehood; silence after wind-shift = unspoken contract sealed. Final image reweights earlier mysteries into communal debt without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers—Mara now co-owns the silence.</comment>

<comment>Distinct lyric compression: “wind threaded through the hollow tiles…turning the quiet into something sharp” teaches pattern early; payoff when wind drop cues covenant seal. Perceptual signature—Mara notices ceremonial potential in moonlit shawl, hears future in almost-audible clapper—stays consistent. Dialogue minimal, indirect, age-appropriate: Kito’s shrug and proverb-like line reveal worldview. No filter-verb stacks; syntax mirrors held breath of clandestine labor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentence delivers sanction context, donor mystery, and Mara's emotional stance. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Metaphors are spare, precise—“box sagging…like it suddenly weighed more than he did.” Final line achieves rhythmic lift without purple inflation. One near-loop: “kept asking, kept organizing, kept hope” tolerated because it accumulates her stubbornness and leads directly to bell action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: sanctions-era food scarcity + anonymous mutual aid as anti-heroic resistance, not NGO charity. Bell repurposed from school summoner to covenant seal—object re-inflection feels inevitable. Risk of quiet ending without physical showdown paid off by conceptual reweighting. Could swap sanctions for other siege, but midnight food runs + cracked bell + terra-cotta acoustics are idiosyncratic enough to resist generic transplant.</comment>
