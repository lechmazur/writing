<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is dense, specific, and embodied (“shard lodged under tongue”); the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort drives every beat and forecloses his old life with felt cost. Working-memory training is dramatized through tactile ritual rather than label-speak. The only minor drag is the off-stage townspeople whose verdict is inferred rather than pressured in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bottle warms only when the alchemist’s reimagined town pattern seals against despair, making the cost conceptual yet undeniable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—lantern reflections, salt, bottle hexagons accumulate until pattern crystallizes; no causal turns required. Orientation is taught by second sentence; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is lived-in through alchemist-perceptual filters: “hulls knocking softly like teeth,” salt-flaking skins, workshop amber catching fractured light. The bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains his final choice—its refusal to open forces the reimagining experiment. Sensory economy is strict; every visual or haptic detail mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—can a town be reimagined without repeating ruin—signals early and tightens when the bottle’s warming makes the cost of failure conceptual. One meaningful deepening: shift from “how to open” to “how to let the town enter” reweights options under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lantern light fracturing into hexagons becomes metaphor for society refracted through new patterns. No moralizing; the final warmth of the bottle is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful—will anyone return?—but undeniably reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close voice is stable, alchemist-bound, with syntax that mimics alchemical precision (“he overlaid other possibilities atop that map”). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices rust, salt, lattice-arranged light. No dialogue required; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Metaphors are internally coherent (lantern/bottle/teeth). Minor template cadence in “not to force, not to flame, not even to thought” is purposeful triad, not artifact. No loops or register drift; final line lands with rhythmic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-wish ghost town + alchemical working memory + unopenable bottle as societal crucible. Risky quiet ending earns Charged Poise rather than spectacle. Transformation test passes—story collapses without alchemist-specific intellect and bottle constraint. No derivative echoes.</comment>
