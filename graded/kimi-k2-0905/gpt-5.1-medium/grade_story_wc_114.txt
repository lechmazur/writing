<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory need to exhume yet fear the swallowed truth is dramatized in her pacing, splintered palms, and final whispered acceptance; the oracle’s refusal to forget externalizes her own fault-tolerance flaw. Cost is visceral in the swallowed weight settling “low in her chest.” Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-labeling. Minor: we never see her act on the revelation, only accept its burden—slightly lowers agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s admission “the weight is mine to carry” crystallizes options—she must descend with the truth—while the green dawn reweights every prior image under conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: oracle’s memory (because) forces the confession (therefore) that forecloses erasure. Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mountain station, iced railings, and auroral glow constrain escape routes and supply the oracle’s wind power; the Feverwhisper illustration is handled twice—first as relic, finally as extinct casualty—charging the closing image. Micro-setting (clipboard, monitor glass) doubles as emotional mirror without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment meaningfully shapes the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mara reclaim or re-bury the truth—tightens once when the oracle refuses erasure; cost is the irreversible ownership of dangerous knowledge. No reversals needed under causal lens; one meaningful narrowing qualifies. Pressure coherent, no coincidence. Could use slightly more visible tactical consequence (e.g., immediate physical risk) to reach top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of complicity versus witness emerges through the oracle’s memory ethic and the extinct plant, never sermonized. Final green dawn reweights “auroral sorrow” without moral tag. Subtext in clipped dialogue (“your temperature has stabilized”) carries institutional menace. Avoids tidy binary; reader left to weigh cost of knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual tilt: “certainties sway like the needle of an old barometer.” Oracle’s voice is mechanically distinct—static hiss, data syntax—without stealing focalization. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Prose rhythm mirrors barometric pressure: long inhalations, short clipped exhalations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and precise—“rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry”—never clots the fever-beat. Information density high; each line advances memory, weather, or stake. One participle opener flagged but temporal order remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-fiction thriller and introspective lyric feels fresh; steering storms via jet-stream leash is specific rather than abstract eco-menace. Feverwhisper plant links personal grief to geo-engineering crime, transforming familiar eco-loss into conspiratorial stakes. Voice and image set are memorable; removal would collapse the piece. Minor: premise nods to familiar geo-engineering tropes, slightly capping novelty.</comment>
