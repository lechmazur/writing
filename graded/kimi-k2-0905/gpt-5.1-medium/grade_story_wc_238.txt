<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirabel’s contradictory need to salvage both ego and friendship is embodied in every micro-choice (handing over the perfume, surrendering her column). The apology is dramatized, not labelled; her trembling thumb on “send” externalises the cost. Interiority stays specific to a journalist who thinks in headlines yet now drowns in metaphor. One slip: “thought…apology” flirts with summary; keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook CR: the column’s transmission re-weights the entire premise—public confession as imperfect miracle—felt on line “a small electric offering.” Causal lens holds: each surge is because/therefore feedback. Orienting props (conservatory, duffel, reel-to-reel) appear by 70 words; spatial debt is waived because disorientation charges the final glow. No plot amnesia; perfume and sheet-music are tracked to the last spark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper-veined floor, reel-to-reel spinning without tape, and the perfume bottle as micro-setting constrain every spiritual move; their final alignment ignites the closing image. Selective sensory triage—ozone, toner, citrus—mirrors Mirabel’s pulse. Exterior orchard waits like held breath, but spatial choreography keeps interior geography clear. Enough specificity for 9-band; one extra exterior anchor would lock it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she publish the apology?—tightens once: decision to hit “send” forecloses easy fame, visible in the orchard-green exit sign hum. Agency is internal yet narrows external options; price is her public reputation. Escalation is one meaningful crescendo under the causal lens; no static loops. Cost is legible; could edge 9.0 with a sharper prior temptation beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>“Imperfect miracle” moves from marketing catch-phrase to lived cost without ever being named in scene. Theme emerges through charged objects: perfume → friendship, reel-to-reel → echo, manuscript smoke → erased legacy. Final column-release offers Conceptual Repricing: grace via self-exposure. No moral patter—just the silent spark as answer. Subtext carries in flicker, scent, hand-steadying-hand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Compressed lyric diction (“gossip-column exorcist,” “sold thunder as jewellery”) is taught early and paid off at climax. Perceptual signature—metaphors-as-sight—remains coherent under fluorescent stutter. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens to skin-level tremor. Rhythm modulates from litany of headlines to single-line confession. One filter-verb clump (“she felt another hand”) barely dents clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High metaphor density is patterned and paid off, not ornamental. Sentence rhythm accelerates from catalog to one-sentence release. No synonym loops; copper, spark, echo recur with escalating charge. Peak beat (“a small electric offering”) is clean and pivotal. Two near-clichés (“hush lay like held breath,” “called collect”) minor nicks at 9-border.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of celebrity-ghosting with fading sheet-music archive offers fresh social angle; trope transformed through music manuscript literally erasing itself. Perfume-as-archive-key feels inevitable yet unexpected. Structure risk—lyric columnar confession—heightens rather than obscures meaning. Could hit 9+ with more idiosyncratic occupational detail (newspaper newsroom scent, ink-type, etc.).</comment>
