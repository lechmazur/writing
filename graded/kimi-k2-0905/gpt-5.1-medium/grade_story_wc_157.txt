<comment>Arlen’s ironic, archivist-smuggler voice is vivid, but his interior contradiction—why risk so much for a garden graffito—never sharpens into a single on-page micro-choice that costs him. The entomologist’s pivot supplies the only visible beat of pressure, not his own stakes. A stronger visceral crunch (tax audit fear, seed-packet forgery slip) would earn the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city sleeps above a subterranean sentence whose political cost is felt in the Ministry’s future audits. Causal chain holds—each forged permit leads to gourd-seed grammar—though the final beat is collective, not personal. One tightening beat where Arlen’s forged signature almost fails would push this to 9+.</comment>

<comment>Beetle-click typewriter acoustics, bottled-moon terrariums, and Ministry seed receipts form an irreplaceable toolkit that literally seeds the rebellion. The greenhouse constrains every tactical choice—lights-off, pest-control cover story—while insect density becomes alphabet. Environment shapes tactics and charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—curiosity as contraband—tightens when flower=word jeopardy faces seed-purchase audits. Escalation is textural: each new garden plot thickens the surveillance risk, felt cost legible in forged-grant jeopardy. More individual jeopardy (Arlen’s name on a docket) would sharpen the screw another turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of linguistic wildlife under surveillance blooms without sermon. Final image of “quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams” reweights earlier beetle-clicks as insurgent syntax, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral, only the cost of cultivating illegible meaning inside a ledgered world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person flaneur diction—“smuggling questions for a living”—maintains consistent perceptual signature; compressed syntax mimics smuggler caution. Insect acoustics replace exposition. No head-hop, no register drift; lyric ellipsis taught early (“candidly cryptic”) and paid off in final garden sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm clicks like beetle exoskeletons; sentence lengths vary to mimic wing-beat cadence. Two adjacent “like” similes (“like bottled moons / like impatient typewriters”) verge on pattern overload but serve sonic world-building. Zero scaffold, high lexical specificity—no synonym churn. Closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Horticulture-as-encryption feels inevitable yet fresh; taxonomic insurgency fuses cli-fi with libre-poetics. Risk—turning community gardens into protest billboards—amplifies stakes without gimmickry, butterfly-migration cost for students is heartbreaking micro-detail. Transformation passes proximity test: swap beetles for birds and entire metaphor collapses.</comment>
