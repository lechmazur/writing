<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Etta’s warmly inquisitive nature is shown through embodied micro-choices—timing the theft, rehearsing lies, pressing the door with apologies—so the trait drives the plot. The diary reading reframes her own past injuries into annotated joy, a credible internal change that costs her the safety of ignorance. The “ascending servant” descriptor is repeated but never dramatized as status threat; hence not quite 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Etta decides to carry the captain’s “method” back down, a renunciation that re-weights how she will read future suffering. Causal chain holds—goggles reveal seams, script is decrypted by kindness not force, diary reconfigures her perception—cost is the cold corridor and the now-undeniable responsibility to see joy beneath anguish. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-scatter decryption tightens meaning once; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire is more than backdrop: frost locks the corridor, metal warms under compassionate touch, prism light is the literal key—environment constrains every beat. Goggles act as micro-setting/tool hybrid, their cracked tint teaching the decryption rule early and charging the final image. Selective sensory economy—silver ferns of frost, amber-green tint—anchors without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“seek out the joy beneath anguish”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the diary method is distilled into a single transferable rule. One meaningful deepening: the encryption is revealed not as secrecy but as enforced annotation of joy, which re-prices the cost of empathy. No visible resource loss beyond cold breath, but the conceptual price (she can no longer unread suffering) is felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the decryption metaphor: suffering must be read in parallel with its own counter-margins of joy. Subtext is carried by gesture—pressing apology to metal, murmuring to a door—rather than thesis statement. Final image of descent as “ascending servant” offers quiet conceptual re-pricing; no moralizing sentence spells it out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Etta’s perceptual filter: cracked goggles tint the world amber-green, script loops “like polite suffering.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure (“metal warmed…rotated”). No head-hop; POV stays strictly servant-bound. Pattern of scattered-light reading is taught in first third and repaid at closure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with elevator ascent—long sentences climb, then fragment in cold air. Mixed metaphors (“sunlit daggers”, “sealed eyes”) remain consistent within frozen-optic motif; no clarity loss. One paraphrase loop: “affectionate detachment she hardly understood” echoed two sentences later; minor −0.2. Otherwise high density: each sentence advances goal or prism-light imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Freshest turn: empathy as literal decryption key—door opens to consolation, not lock-pick. Goggles-as-cipher-lens repurposes steampunk prop into emotional tool. “Ascending servant” concept risks cliché but is salvaged by final inversion—descent that redefines ascent. Palace-above-clouds is familiar venue, but encrypted-joy annotation rule feels non-obvious and inevitable after closure.</comment>
