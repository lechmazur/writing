<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic— “I sighed, because the quarry never sent me into town for nothing” shows embodied reluctance under pressure. The refusal to offer hard proof keeps the flaw alive: the narrator clings to a private ontology that costs social ease. Micro-choices (telling Mrs Harper, touching frost) foreclose anonymity and escalate exposure; the final “truthful lies” stance is earned. No contradictory impulses inside any single beat keep it from the 8-band.

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the town re-tunes its attention to its own echo, the narrator accepts perpetual disbelief as price—felt in “disbelief feels impolite.” Causal chain: frost image → quarry command →挨家“reading” → communal hush → renunciation of proof. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “I knew that kind of silence” repeats prior diction without new pressure, −0.1.

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost-latticed windshield function as micro-settings that dictate next move; both are tactile, rendered through bone and grammar metaphors. Mist thickness carries prior night’s exhalations—weather as emotional archive. Spatial choreography clean: downhill walk, sedan outside post office, prism angled. Final image of people “meeting abandoned relatives” reweights everyday props—earned 9-band gate.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: vindicating emotional-object theory; pressure tightens from private quest to public confession. Escalation: each house-call risks ridicule; townsfolk’s growing attentive hush narrows narrator’s options—retreat or keep speaking. Cost legible: loss of anonymity, acceptance of “polite disbelief.” No coincidence; all tension born from narrator’s elected disclosures.

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges—objects archive unprocessed feeling—via frost patterns and doorknob confessions, never sermonizes. Subtext in gesture: mechanic setting wrench down “as though it were listening” shows tool-as-witness without exposition. Final “truthful lies” crystallizes paradox of unverifiable truth—resonant reconfiguration. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; image of coffee cooling on porches supplies after-echo.

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric diction sustains perceptual signature—“bones the mountain had decided to wear outside its skin.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long sentence for hush descent, fragments for frost veins. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly narrator-bound. Metaphor density taught early and paid off in final “abandoned relatives” line—controls ear without clutter.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver place, metaphor, emotional temperature. Rhythm modulates—spondaic clusters under pressure, then breathable caesuras. No synonym loops; “frost” returns only with new semantic charge. Minor filter verb “seemed” in “furniture seemed to clear its throat” forgiven for voice; does not recur in climax.

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—town mystic reading emotion-ice on windshields—is fresh, avoids haunted-object cliché. Frost as palimpsest reconfigures familiar winter trope. Narrator’s “responsible curiosity” reframes pseudoscience as moral stance—non-obvious angle. Risky second-person door-to-door sequence paid off by communal hush magnification—bold yet coherent.
