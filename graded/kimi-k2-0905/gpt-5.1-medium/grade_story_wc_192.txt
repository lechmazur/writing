<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“the breath you held back… pooled in this hollow”—and her contradictory impulse to vanish yet still be witnessed drives every beat. The scar-linked memory transfer externalizes her lifelong pattern of self-erasing exits, making the final inhale a credible, earned pivot. Cost is visible: she has nothing left to burn. Minor hedge: “tired of hovering” edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the next sentence grounds it in concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last line reweights every prior bridge-burning into a new bridge igniting “in a different direction,” fulfilling the fading-threshold concept. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each exit has deposited breathable air in the sanctuary until Mara can finally inhale it. Causality is intact: the doorknocker’s warmth, the starlit dust, the scar map all pay off in the final breath. Felt cost is inescapable—“every shore behind her was blackened.”</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s roofless charcoal bowl and starlit dust are not backdrop but breathable medium—“the air… drag through her lungs like a river changing direction.” Spatial choreography is clean: single path, benches, center circle, all constrain movement toward the keeper. The eye-shaped doorknocker reappears as tactile warmth, anchoring threshold logic. Without this specific hollow, the final inhale would lose its environmental viscerality.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mara ever let herself be seen?—tightens when the keeper reveals she has been arriving here all along. Agency stays hers: she lifts the ring, offers her palm, chooses to inhale. One meaningful deepening—shared scars as memory archive—narrows escape options to a single breath. Cost is palpable: the blackened shores cannot be uncooked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the only way out of self-erasure is to inhabit the very hollow one’s exits carved. Subtext lives in gesture—scar against scar—never thesis. Final image of a bridge burning inward reconfigures abandonment as potential return, refusing moral symmetry. Ambiguity lingers: saved or still drowning?—yet the reader feels the re-priced air.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</degree>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias—“starlight gnawed quietly at its own reflection.” Syntax grows breath-short under pressure—“the breath you held back… pooled”—mirroring suffocation. No head-hopping; keeper’s voice is heard in bone, not quoted, preserving distance. Register stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon even at philosophical edge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long, river-like sentences outside to staccato inhale at close. Figurative language is dense but patterned—bridges, shores, rivers, thresholds—paid off in final re-casting. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances stakes or air. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—“shadow keeper teaches outcast to breathe”—is re-cast via scar-archived memory and inverted bridge combustion. Specificity of charcoal dust as breathable medium freshens the conceit. Risk taken: quiet, lyric escalation instead of showdown, yet coherence holds. Threshold as tangible particulate air feels novel and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
