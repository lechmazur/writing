<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s synesthetic, guilt-driven obsession is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (rewiring prototypes, feeding absences) flows from the wound of self-betrayal. Interior contradiction is alive: the need to “stop” trust-breaking collides with the knowledge that he caused his own. The final renunciation—no device can rewind his silence—carries visible cost under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prototype’s dual-note reweights the kitchen memory, showing the narrator’s complicity. Causal chain holds: because he harvested absences, he can hear both betrayals; therefore he accepts the device cannot erase guilt. Cost is palpable in the lacquer image—new memory layered over cracked wood. Accumulation pattern taught early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drowned greenhouse constrains every move: skeletal branches snag gear, chemical aurora powers the forge, water pressure shapes sound传导. The ashen forge recurs as charged object—stone once drank fire, now drinks absence—its cooled surface pressed in the climax, grounding the lacquer image. Environment directly enables the synesthetic science and mirrors internal fracture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—signaled in line one. Escalation via each dive’s harvested absence tightening the sonic net until the prototype releases the dual betrayal note; price is the narrator’s confrontation with his own silence. Agency is continuous (design, test, adjust) under causal lens. Cost legible: acceptance of irreversible self-betrayal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trust is a lacquered instrument—repaired, never pristine. Subtext resides in synesthetic palette shifts (mute green, breathing blue) rather than exposition. Final repricing: betrayal is bilateral, device can only warn, not redeem. Complexity preserved; no moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person synesthetic voice remains distinct: compressed metaphor (“glass breathing out”), technical diction (“timbre,” “filament”) filtered through grief. Rhythm accelerates with breathless anaphora during forge scene, then quietens into lacquer image. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data without scaffold. Metaphors disciplined to synesthetic logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “hull split by…” lines but does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic undersea sound-archaeologist crafting anti-betrayal ear orchards. Premise inseparable from setting and character wound. Risk taken with lyrico-technical diction pays off in charged closure. No familiar template echoed; transformation test passed.</comment>
