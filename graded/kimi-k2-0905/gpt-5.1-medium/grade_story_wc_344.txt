<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority glimmers—his nostalgia “like old driftwood” is specific—but he never faces a hard choice that costs him anything. The mirrors ask for repair, yet he stays a cipher: no contradiction, no visible flaw, no moment where he might fail or refuse. The “rhythm of repair” remains an abstract want; it never rubs against a counter-desire or stakes his body or reputation. Closure is gentle thaw, not earned renunciation, so the arc feels observed, not lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is declared early (“I had come to learn the rhythm of repair”) and holds: each mirror beat thickens the texture of release until the library itself thaws. Causality is poetic, not mechanical—gears become keys by sympathetic magic—yet the pattern is legible and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost: the building breathes, the locksmith is spent. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt applies. The only slack is that the prophecy scraps act as a soft permission rather than a tightening constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s protagonist: frost-feathered atlases, mirrors that swallow lives, a bottle of melted centuries—each detail is tactile, selective, and charged. The “crystal vertebra” metaphor risks excess but is earned by internal consistency. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the bottle’s lead cap and the gear teeth constrain the final acts. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never float. The environment literally softens as emotional pressure rises, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are atmospheric, not personal: the library’s silence must be un-layered, but the locksmith risks no loss other than fatigue. Pressure deepens by accretion—each mirror releases a stranger’s breath—yet the protagonist’s options never narrow, only multiply in gentle success. The cost is off-loaded onto anonymous mirror-victims; the locksmith pays nothing visible. The final thaw is beautiful but not a trade-off, so escalation stays lyrical rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair emerges through concrete images—gears, frost, mirrors—never thesis statements. The idea that “unfinished sentences” can be re-assembled into audible ticking is elegantly non-verbal. Final image of the library listening while it thaws offers a resonant, non-moral answer: repair is contagious, not possessive. No drift into moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whose memory is truly mended.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-essayistic, yet every metaphor is filtered through a clockmaker’s perceptual signature: time is tasted, frost is heard, mirrors tick. Syntax modulates from elongated hypnotic cadences to staccato gear-clicks under pressure. No POV drift; the “I” stays strictly limited to what a lone visitor can know. The slightly archaic diction (“rime,” “atlases of extinct rivers”) feels vocationally earned, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense but never congested: “each spine a frozen current of some forgotten sea” does triple sensory work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or motion. Metaphors stay internally coherent—frost, glass, driftwood, tide—forming a private lexicon. Only the phrase “soft hush of a distant morning” flirts with cliché, but it is isolated and immediately particularized by the sky “forgetting to turn the light all the way on.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “lunar-eclipse locksmith” who owns no keys is a fresh conceit; the library that thaws only when strangers’ throats unlock is a quiet reversal of architectural agency. Gears as sympathetic keys, mirrors as memory latches—the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in near-static lyric mode, yet coherence never wavers. Minor deduction for echoing the familiar “frozen library in the sky” trope; rescue comes from the physiological thaw tied to anonymous exhalations.</comment>
