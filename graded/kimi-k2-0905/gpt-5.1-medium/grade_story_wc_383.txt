<comment>Neris’s “charmed skeptic” contradiction is dramatized in the moment she presses the shell to her ear despite fear; her embodied tremor and micro-choice to keep listening give interiority bite. The caretaker’s single speech act (“You change the purpose of the cage”) catalyzes her shift from avoidance to archivist, so renunciation is earned. Interior contradiction is sustained throughout—physics perfume, archive-as-file-label—without lapsing into diagnostic self-talk. Guilt quarantine is shown via sensory flashback, not labeled, so the flaw complicates rather than explains.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Neris re-weights her lifelong guilt-quarantine into an archive she can study; the caretaker’s lantern paling to morning light delivers visible cost—night of exposure, no absolution yet. Causal linkage holds: shell → memory → caretaker revelation → stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (velvet garden, twilight, stone bench) arrive by line 6; no debt. One shard only; default scope met.</comment>

<comment>Garden functions as micro-setting: shelved roses become literal shelves for quarantined sorrow, constraining Neris’s choice to listen rather than flee. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—sound of salt-laced hush, visual of lantern-shadowed cheeks—guiding attention to shell and bench. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: shell found on bench, caretaker emerges from hedges, lantern placed beside them. No tourist catalog; every detail is filtered through her skeptical, physics-leaning bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she confront the quarantined guilt or keep it sealed?—is signaled at shell pick-up. One meaningful tightening: caretaker’s question (“what are you quarantining…”) collapses her avoidance, forcing the decision to learn listening. Cost is legible—night-long exposure, dawn arrival without emotional release—under causal lens. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her consent to keep the shell at ear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: quarantine as mercy vs. laziness, isolation vs. archive. Shell, garden, lantern re-weight at closure without moralizing. Subtext in caretaker’s flat tone and lantern shadow keeps exposition off-stage. Final image of paling flame answers the thematic question—confinement can be repurposed, not erased—through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third limited stays tightly bound to Neris’s skeptical perceptual signature—“unreliable physics wearing too much perfume.” No head-hop; caretaker’s interior is only inferred. Syntax mirrors mental state—long sentences for avoidance, fragments under shell vision. Register stable; no filter-verb stacks. Lantern, shell, salt-hush serve as rhythmic refrains rather than repetitive stems.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High density: “archive for resting sorrows” compresses world-rule and metaphor in four words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“bell of a hospital isolation ward” is precise. No synonym loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm accelerates during shell vision, then exhales with dawn. Read-aloud ear varies naturally; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory quarantine via sound-resonance in a twilight garden is novel yet inevitable. Trope of magical object is re-cast as clinical archive with a broken shell half. Conceptual risk—quiet ending without forgiveness—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail (“washed-out ink” eyes, lantern of blue glass) prevents swap into generic fantasy.</comment>
