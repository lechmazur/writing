<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Eren’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“counted who was missing”); his micro-choices under checkpoint rifles show a hierarchy of values. The mail-drop ritual and bottled-storm trust display internal contradiction—respectful bow vs. secret rebellion—acted in-scene. A visible cost is implied: if the storm fails, the fragile neutrality he ferries collapses. The only minor drag is the late, slightly abstract phrasing of “broken promises heal” that edges toward label-speak, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Situational lens holds: escalating border tension funnels into the arcade’s neutral hour; coincidence (drones ignore the corridor) complicates rather than rescues. Orientation anchors within 120 words: bruised-cobalt sky, empty arcade, twilight, mailman in disputed corridor. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara weighing rebellion vs. storm-risk while the cork trembles—cost is the town’s potential drowning or healing, felt in the final image “thin as smoke.” Persistent constraint: every crack could be claimed by two flags, shaping every cautious step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment (failing fluorescents, cracked roof, drone blink) constrains choices—drones overlook the arcade, enabling hand trade. Micro-setting of Mara’s ex-token stall—circuit boards in brine—supplies unique resource for healing. Cobalt light motif recurs in floor reflections and bottle glass, charging final image. Selective sensory economy (hum, violet flash) keeps density high without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keeping the mail-drop hour alive—tightens when the thunderstorm bottle raises stakes from letters to weather itself. One meaningful deepening: storm shifts from curiosity to potential roof-ripping reckoning. Agency resides in Eren’s decision to deliver without questions and Mara’s poised choice to uncork or not; both foreclose paths with visible risk of drowning the town. Cost is legible: the cork’s tremor literalizes the danger of mis-timed rain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: continuity across engineered absences; storms as collective memory of missing water. No stated moral—final line “thin as smoke” invites ambiguous reading of needed reckoning. Subtext in gesture: ritual nod-substitute for dangerous gratitude; envelopes pinned but never claimed embody lost promises. Conceptual re-pricing: bottled storm reframes prior “linked absences” into potential destructive repayment, reweighting the entire map of gaps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Eren’s selective attention—he counts missing people, notices drone blink, feels bag weight. Syntax mirrors cautious tread: long cadenced sentences that pause at semicolons, matching checkpoint wariness. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Mara’s terse “You are late, mailman” vs. Eren’s courteous ellipsis. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer reflective sentences in corridor, clipped fragments at cork moment. Figurative language is patterned (bruised cobalt, storm-lick) rather than sprawl; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory detail, political context, character motive. Minor scaffold: two “as if” clauses in close succession; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: postal neutrality + weather-smuggling in a derelict arcade. Trope of courier flipped—he traffics meteorology, not guns. Bottle storm feels inevitable product of sky-absence logic seeded early. Risky lyrical compression paid off in resonant final image rather than plot twist.</comment>
