<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s reticence and scholar’s solitude are embodied in every micro-gesture; the interior contradiction—needing silence yet chasing outlawed growth—drives every beat. His decision to embrace fractured testimony is earned via the crystal’s voices and carries visible cost: he must step from index-cards into performative risk. The “weathered innocence” motif is lived, not labeled. Single-POV default; no relationship crucible on stage, so bullets waived cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: courier note → crystal listening → tactical decision to testify in fractured sequences. Orientation locked by line 5; no disorientation penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias descends wearing “barely audible armor,” options reweighted, cost felt. Minor slip: “the council will erase three verbs” is off-stage fiat; still, it triggers all action and is paid for by his public risk, so causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Library, chandelier, cracked crystal, and sonic hush are not backdrop but equipment: the crack enables replay, the hush shapes how he listens, the glass orbs focus sound that will later expose him. Spatial choreography clean across ladder climb and fingertip placement. Dawn light and dust are filtered through Elias’s reticent attention. Final image of hush-as-armor recharges setting; meets 9+ gate via crystal reprise at exit.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can language keep growing—signaled in para 3 and tightened when “grow” is targeted. One meaningful escalation: Elias shifts from passive cataloging to active, performative testimony, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is social exposure and loss of neutral cover; visible in final “barely audible armor.” Agency propels the turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: growth = linguistic + personal, both outlawed yet irrepressible. Subtext in crystal voices shows language adapting via broken syntax; theme crystallizes when Elias chooses to embody that fracture rather than prescribe it. No moralizing; final image invites reflection on silence as both shelter and weapon. Emotional after-effect concrete: reader feels the hush settle like coat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is scholar-poet: precise yet timid, diction “sonically reflective,” syntax lengthens under contemplation then shortens at decision. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled. Rhythm mirrors pressure—long cadences for listening, staccato for courier note. Free-indirect clean; no filter-verb stacks. Distinct perceptual signature: Elias hears dust, sees words as organisms. Elision of council scene taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “words themselves were watching” sets tone + character paranoia. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (sound = light). Information density high: one line delivers rule of silent presses, emotional rationale, and world status. Read-aloud ear excellent; paragraph lengths breathe with ladder ascent / descent. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-dictionary world where verbs can be erased—feels fresh yet inevitable. Crystal-orbs that replay intentioned sound transform familiar library into sonic panopticon. Fractured-testimony tactic grows organically from world rule and character flaw. Risk taken: lyric essayistic drift, but payoff is resonant reconfiguration. Specificity throughout: “softest swallowed like stolen sweets” could only live here.</comment>
