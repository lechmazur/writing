<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to fashion a usable relic—play out in scene, not summary; her decision to cut the first line is earned by the tactile memory of Luca’s “hauntingly practical” love and carries visible cost in the moment she risks fixing him as object. Interiority is concrete and particular (rain-beaded glass as crowd noise, ash as mute animal). No label-speak; even the abstract “harvest lessons from loss” is immediately grounded in micro-choice: the kettle ticks, she sets blank beside cup, breathes the held breath. The flaw: we get no secondary pressure from another live character; at this length acceptable, but keeps it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat = because/therefore (because the lion refused, Luca died; therefore she fled; because the blank is “forgiving,” she dares to cut). Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the first carve opens the wood, foreclosing the safer eternity of the uncarved pause—this is the “something useful” that will now sit beside her “like a tool, not a wound.” Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Accumulated rain/ash/skylight motifs reweight at the exact beat the knife scores, making the cost legible and persistent.</comment>

<comment>Rain-beaded skylight is not backdrop but pressure plate: it softens crowd memory into survivable sound and later beads again the instant she decides—environment directly charging the final image. Ash blank functions as micro-setting; its grain “catches like small hesitations in speech,” constraining whether she dares cut. Spatial choreography is immaculate (loft, kettle, table, palm). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: widow notices sawdust scent evaporating, not circus trivia. Slight slip: “emptied fairgrounds” is the vaguest coordinate—one sentence only, so −0.2, still well above cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake = can she convert static grief into a living, useful object without betraying Luca’s wild seconds. Tightening occurs once but decisively: the blank’s silent weight v. the kettle’s cooling tick narrows options to act now or lose the moment—this is the meaningful escalation required at this length. Cost is visible: the first cut irreversibly ends the era of the uncarved pause, a price she feels in whitening knuckles. Agency is hers; no outside coincidence. Keeps 0.1 shy of 9.0 because the external world offers no additional complicating pressure—escalation is purely internal, sufficient but not multi-layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the only way to keep the dead from becoming a wound is to make them a tool—utility as haunted love letter. Subtext lives in gesture (tracing invisible arcs, closing fingers around空白) rather than declaration. Final image of the first careful line “opening the wood so something useful can stay” reweights every prior mention of ash, pause, and practicality—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Avoids moralizing; reader left to feel the betrayal/usefulness paradox rather than be told its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual grammar: rain “whispered,” wood “did not argue,” time “spilled away like sawdust.” Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—longer, clause-rich sentences during memory, then short staccato (“She sets the blank on the table”) at the decision beat. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are physically coherent (beads on string, weathered metal). Distinct idiom: “lion tamer’s widow, no forwarding address” reads as her self-labeling voice bleeding into narrative. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and ear-tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: single sentences do triple duty (“ash was forgiving, that it bent toward purpose instead of splintering” = theme seed, character memory, foreshadowing of cut). Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are purposeful and internally consistent (circus time = beads on string; kettle = brief permission of heat). Variation in sentence length creates breathing without algorithmic feel. Opening and closing lines are propulsive and Image-charged. Minor alliteration over-indulgence (“rust-hued peace”) is earned by context, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-art trope is refreshed by specific circus residue (pauses where lions remember wildness) and the inversion that utility, not sculpture, is the hoped-for haunting. Risk taken: entire story is static—woman at table with block of wood—yet tension is generated via recalled predator and the irreversibility of first cut. Synthesis feels inevitable: only a tamer of seconds would measure love in bolts and nails; only such widow would trade wound for tool. No close echoes of famous lines; voice is singular.</comment>
