<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ariel’s embodied tasting of memories, the seed lodged behind her sternum, and her “informally wise” snorts all individuate her; the apprentice is thinner. The kernel-swallow moment is a decisive, costly micro-choice that re-configures her perception and launches the pruning. Interior contradiction—hope versus salt decay—stays active in-scene. The apprentice’s late arrival adds mild status pressure, but relationship-as-crucible is under-exploited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse breathes again, the city still drowned, cost felt in the lingering glow of stubborn refusal. Causal chain—seed → synaptic re-wiring → pruning → emergent light—tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rusted greenhouse itself—ribs, missing teeth-glass, salt-stung air—functions as micro-setting that constrains every action; pruning shears, cracked planter, and condensation bottle are tactile tools. Sensory hierarchy obeys a chef’s tongue-first filter. Spatial choreography is clean through aisle, bed, roof cracks. Final glow through broken panes recharges the opening “old lung” image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“wake the greenhouse tonight”—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each clipped dead vine narrows the option to surrender; celestial alignment provides live clock. Cost is visible in soot under nails, sweat, and the seed’s irreversible internal graft. No coincidence; the moons simply heighten texture rather than solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of gentle rebellion emerges through pruning as love-not-war against decay; no explicit thesis. Final image—glow inside ruin—reconfigures meaning without moral. Subtext in shears-as-argument, soup-as-memory keeps reflection rooted in concrete action. Ambiguity is purposeful: will stories feed?—remains charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Ariel’s tongue-brain; no head-hop. Diction—“informally wise sound, unadorned with doctrine yet dense with lived days”—is chef-specific, not generic. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentence for memory-rush, then clipped pruning commands. Dialogue sparse, carries subtext (“time bends… rude to hurry”). No register drift; metaphors remain gustatory or vegetal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: “salt, rust, mildew, and beneath it all the thin citrus sting of old hope” does four jobs in nine words. No scaffold loops; occasional adjectival richness is pattern-taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“synaptic plasticity”) is brief and motivated by seed mechanic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef reviving a drowned greenhouse via palate-planted seed is a fresh synthesis. Gentle rebellion via pruning而非battle avoids post-apocalypse cliché. Specificity—“veined with faint silver, no larger than a fingernail”—anchors concept. Final glow recharges opening lung metaphor, feeling inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
