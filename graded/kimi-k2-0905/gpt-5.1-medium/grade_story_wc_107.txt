<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corin’s contradictory impulses—ex-targeting-lens craftsman now forging vessels for “unfinished thoughts”—are dramatized in the kiln gesture; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the invitation crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete, embodied in frost-numbed fingers and thawing ribs, never sliding into label-speak. The final cost is felt: returning will mean stepping into “a question that warms itself,” foreclosing the safety of detachment. The single on-page relationship (visitor/glassblower) functions as crucible, status shift legible in the sideways “crown” placement and the deferred apology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the console-cradled glass vessel reconfigures the abandoned control room from command node to invitation zone, cost paid by the narrator’s “cautious heart shift.” Accumulative lens holds: thawing ice, dripping panels, and amber glass tighten the stake—containment becomes porous inquiry—without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and stay stable; no penalty. One meaningful deepening at the bookmark burial suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost-dust-light, frozen cables, and the kiln’s ember constrain movement and metaphor: ice melt dictates timeline, console surface supplies the literal pedestal for the final image. Micro-setting (cracked bookmark transformed into glass spine) charges closure by anchoring the “safe zone” concept. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but is filtered through POV’s wonder, never touristic. Spatial choreography clean: Corin’s boots among cables, narrator tracing erased labels—bodies track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the room’s thaw be weaponized or hospitable—tightens when the bookmark is entombed in glass, foreclosing its archival past. Pressure accrues via melting ice and amber hardening; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Corin’s former precision skill is repurposed, narrator’s detachment forfeited. One credible loss—abandoned certainty—alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: control’s illusion vs. containment’s reality reshaped into invitation. Subtext lives in gesture—sideways crown, bookmark spine—never sermon. Final image reweights prior targeting imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the “question that warms itself” invites counter-readings of danger and care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: “undecided sentences” for icicles, “stubborn ember” for kiln. Syntax lengthens under awe, compresses at exit—“slightly, within its ribs.” No head-hopping; POV modesty intact—narrator infers Corin’s interior only through observed ritual. Dialogue sparse, stylized, but differentiated: Corin’s oratory vs. narrator’s hesitant queries.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long frost-images, staccato drip-sentences during pour. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—ice as breath, glass as memory—without muddle. One scaffold risk: “dramatically narrating mundane tasks” is repeated, but pattern is taught early and justifies voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise flips Cold-War control room into artisanal sanctuary; ex-weaponsmith blows glass for doubt, not destruction. Transformation is specific: targeting lenses → conversation vessels, bookmark → translucent spine. Risk—lyric essay within fiction—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Detail is irreplaceable: obsolete switch labels half-erased, kiln beside dead panel.</comment>
