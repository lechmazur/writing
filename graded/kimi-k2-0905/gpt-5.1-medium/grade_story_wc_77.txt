<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory fear of living-light vs. dying-dark is embodied in freeze-dried saliva, bloated Polaroids, and the kneel on the pier planks; the final confession to his child-fear literally shifts the clasp and warms the photo, paying the cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the advisor’s damp fingertip metaphor repeats once too often. The earned stasis—still haunted yet breathing—lands because the prior beats have tied the clasp/photo to his stalled resurrection. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each mirror corridor beat is a because/therefore consequence of touching the clasp, culminating in the decisive change on the pier where confession reclaims his heartbeat and reconfigures the photo. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are retaught at every mirror shard; disorientation is intentional and paid off when the pier loop shatters. Closure carries visible cost: the clasp leaves the boy’s hands, the photo warms, and “darkness waits patient without hunger”—a conceptual repricing that forecloses easy resurrection. Minor loop: “lingering luminance” phrase repeats four times in 700 words without escalation of meaning, a hairline drag.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors, rotting bulbs, and river-pier planks are tactile, smell of wet velvet/formaldehyde, and constrain every step Elias takes; the clasp operates as micro-setting that literally locks him to the drowning moment. Spatial choreography is flawless—ticket-booth ledge to corridor to mirror to pier and back—each transition taught through the mirrors’ inward twist. The Polaroid’s temperature shift (cold→warm) functions as a charged object that anchors the final image. No credibility errors; carnival decay and resuscitation details read accurate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish returning from death or stay photographically cursed—is signaled in line 3 and tightens exactly once when Elias realizes he must unbosom to the boy-fear holding the clasp. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens: each mirror deepens the cost of denial until the pier confrontation forces the trade-off. The price is visible—the clasp transfers, the photo warms—but the option space does not narrow further, keeping it shy of 8.8. No off-stage coincidence; the advisor’s whisper always precedes action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—fear of being seen alive after trauma—emerges through the photo’s refusal to show living color and the mirrors that replay death until Elias names the dread. The opera-clasp-as-rosary reweights at closure: from shackles to forfeited token, embodying the conceptual shift without moralizing. Final image (“darkness waits patient without hunger”) offers resonant ambiguity: survival is not victory but ongoing haunting. No platitudes; insight grows from specific pier confession and photo warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Second-person whisper inside the skull sustains a damp, spoiled-fruit diction that compresses under pressure (“thick saliva of hospital tubes”). Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices reflections as “badly developed photographs” and smells “wet velvet,” never drifting into generic carnival shorthand. Rhythm modulates—long clauses in corridors, staccato confession on pier. No head-hopping; advisor remains disembodied voice. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and mostly propulsive; sentences open varied and carry double duty (image + stakes). Two micro-loops: “lingering luminance” repeated four times; “repulsive allure” twice without new nuance—minor scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (mirrors as curtains, crowd as negatives). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final line “darkness waits patient without hunger” is crisp, high-information closure. Typos absent; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: photo-as-unreliable-resurrection-device welded to funhouse mirrors that literally develop his death loop. The boy-fear clutching an opera-clasp-rosary is a non-obvious externalization of survivor’s guilt. Risky lyric compression (“single wound” mouths) pays off when the pier shatters like glass. Could not swap carnival or photo for generic horror props without breaking causality. Minor echo of “fear finished the drowning” feels inevitable, not borrowed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Whispering advisor’s damp fingertip cues every forward move; refusal to obey would return him to watery stillness. Voice vanishes at pier climax—pleasure-gasp becomes silence—marking Elias’s reclaimed agency. Early signal, mid-scene pressure, closure absence is purposeful forfeiture, not omission.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clasp appears at ticket booth, transferred to boy-fear, then reclaimed—three distinct beats that lock Elias to the drowning frame. Its twin-mask “single wound” motif reweights at confession from shackle to surrendered token. Without it, photo stays cold and return fails.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is the spatial path he follows, the photo’s sickly tint, and the un-dimming brightness in his skull that he finally admits terrorizes him. Early signal, middle mirror corridor, final image of darkness now “patient” because the light has been faced.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Photographic curse prevents any new Polaroid from showing him alive, driving him to the funhouse; only there does tint warm after clasp transfer. Constraint visible in every mirror version and in the pocketed photo’s temperature shift. Story logic collapses without this rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Confession “I am more afraid of living than of dying” is the single pivot that loosens the boy-fear’s grip and shatters the drowning loop. No synonym swap possible; the specific admission redefines both stakes and photo outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dream-dictionary instructions appear as mirror-floor book with his own prior handwriting; mechanics matter—he reads “Unbosom yourself” and obeys. Late first appearance final-third, but it directly scripts the climactic action, earning high development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned funhouse provides mirror corridors that literally ingest him into the pier memory; rotting bulbs cough alive when clasp touched. Setting alters tactics—he cannot reach the boy-fear without entering the mirror maze—and supplies the final image of warm photo in rusted skeleton.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><question>6.4</grade><comment>“After the resuscitation” anchors present narrative to prior clinical death, but no ticking clock or deadline tightens choices; time is psychological, not tracked. Functions as backstory cue rather than live countdown, capping score below 7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Goal to “trick fear into revealing its weakness” is voiced by advisor and achieved when Elias confesses weakness first, turning trick inward. Desire conflicts with terror of perpetual brightness; friction resolved on pier with visible cost—clasp surrendered, photo warms.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repulsive allure saturates every image: yellow halos over cobwebs, bloated blue face, wet velvet stench. Tone modulates from seductive dread to almost human tenderness when boy-fear’s grin slackens, then crystallizes in final haunted-yet-alive breathing. Charges closure image indelibly.</comment>
