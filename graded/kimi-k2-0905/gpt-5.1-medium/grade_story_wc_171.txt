<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator’s exhausted discipline and the insurgent’s barefoot knots give embodied contradiction; both men’s micro-choices (clutching the clipboard, touching ash) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth”—and the final signature is earned by prior causality with visible cost: accepting “survivable disappointment” to stop the burning. The general’s scarred yet “operatively gentle” eyes show status dynamics without head-count clutter. Only the mayor remains a cipher, preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signed page reweights the premise—peace is not justice but “interruption of killing”—and the cost is legible in the negotiator’s self-disgust. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ritual element (salt, ash, water) intensifies the density of remembered loss, crystallizing in the final moon-lit signature. Causality is intact because the envoy’s earlier arithmetic of knots makes his eventual concession inevitable. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient terrace at midsummer”) and never breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked terrace stones, torch rows, and moon-caught bowl of water function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual sequence and charge the final image. Crushed mint, dust, and distant thunder are filtered through the negotiator’s war-dulled senses, mirroring his internal stalemate. Spatial choreography is clean: clipboard laid on stone, barefoot envoy crossing threshold, general’s boots clicking. The environment never stalls momentum; every detail is woven through action and thought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop future villages burning—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy must choose between amnesty for killers or continued war. The negotiator’s single micro-turn—offering compromise he “was embarrassed to write”—narrows options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is visible: both leaders sign while touching ash, accepting moral stain. No coincidence resolves; the signature is forced by prior ritual and arithmetic of dead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: redemption is purchasable only through contaminated compromise. Subtext lives in gesture—touching knots, dipping fingers—rather than declaration. The final image of an “unimpressed yet slightly less condemned” sky offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. Ambiguity is purposeful: the negotiator’s self-loathing lingers, refusing tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to the negotiator’s perceptual signature—clipboard as “fragile armor,” silence as “wounded animal resting”—with rhythmic, controlled syntax that breathes under pressure. No head-hopping; the general’s and envoy’s interiorities surface only through external cues. Diction stays within the negotiator’s worn, professional lexicon; elevated phrases (“celestial bodies,” “conceptual repricing”) are filtered via his strategic mind. Voice modulation under stress is evident in clipped final exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“artillery muttered like old gods”—never clogging high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one line can anchor setting, metaphor, and emotional state. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ritual-peace-talk frame feels fresh: war pauses because stars align, not because generals grow conscience. Specific detail—bellmetal staff, thread-counting barefoot envoy—transforms familiar trope of cease-fire into lived rite. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals, yet coherence holds. The synthesis of cosmic clock and moral grime is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
