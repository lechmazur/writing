<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia, painter’s eye, and need to wring meaning from detritus are concrete and embodied; the amber pocketing and decision to trade it crystallize her hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids label-speak—“sleep had been a rumor” is character-particular. The brooch’s weight recasting the day is a palpable micro-choice. Flaw: we don’t see her genuinely stumble; the guard’s nod feels slightly convenient, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (vanished tide, insect in amber, rain trails) layers density until the final exchange reweights survival itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara walks toward city lights carrying both canvases and the cost of trading time-fossil for water; options narrow to that bleak trade. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final “exchange of hungers.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal island, wet vertebrae-stones, and gravid bruise-colored sky are selective, sense-crossed, and choreographed; the exposed seabed and fossilized forest insect directly constrain Mara’s choice to leave. The body-as-setting appears in sleepless tremor and boot-squelch. Micro-objects—brooch, paints, cracked canteen—carry history and future. Final image of rain-slick road as “vertebrae” recharges earlier motif and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: secure water for the island. Pressure tightens when tide fails and Eron jokes the brooch might buy rain; Mara’s decision to cross literalizes that desperate leap. Escalation is situational—environmental betrayal forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible—she forfeits the preserved past and embraces uncertain barter—but off-island resolution is partly off-stage, slightly softening final punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme: the compulsion to convert relics into salvation when natural cycles collapse. Emerges through amber→water trade, not statement. Subtext lives in guard’s silent “recognition” and fossil insect’s prayer. Final image reframes prior paintings as failed prayers, now exchanged for one last bet, offering resonant ambiguity without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is painterly—color, texture, composition metaphors—yet syntactically controlled; “sleep smudged it away” is perceptually specific. Compression (“gravid with more promises than rain”) is taught early and sustained. No head-hop; distance stable. Dialogue sparse but differentiated: Eron’s pragmatism vs. Naida’s acid prophecy. Rhythm modulates with sleepless fragmentation yet stays lucid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density—sentences perform double duty: “clouds hung low, gravid with more promises than rain” fuses metaphor, mood, and world logic. Varied rhythm; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Fresh figurative choices (“thought she could almost think before exhaustion smudged it away”) avoid purple. Minor lapse: “the idea…landed in her chest with the weight of intention” is a touch familiar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cli-fi, insomnia noir, and fossil amber as currency feels non-obvious and specific; tidal road as breathing thought is memorable. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule bending. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at closure. Slight echo of “water wars” trope but localized through painter’s gaze and insect relic.</comment>
