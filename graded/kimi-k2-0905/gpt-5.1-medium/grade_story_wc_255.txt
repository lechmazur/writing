<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Micro-choices are vivid: Mira barters "awakenings," palms a warped reed, and refuses coin. The innocently-cunning trait shows in the instant she agrees to paint the unpaintable. Closure lands in earned stasis—she finishes the canvas and the plant blooms—cost paid in sleepless ash under her nails. Flaws are legible yet never diagnosed; interiority stays specific to her color-blind perception of "textures and temperatures of light."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new pot, reed, and ash fleck thickens the symbolic density until the final canvas crystallizes. Closure is the Charged Poise of the silent reed + blooming conspirator-plant; cost is the stranger’s transferred insomnia and Mira’s stained hands. Spatial choreography is clean; orientation anchored by line 3. No telegraphing of rules; the plant-alphabet is shown before it is needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Courtyard is lived-in: Mira’s bare feet test heat in cobblestone seams, kiln air shimmers against the blank canvas, reed’s metallic scent lingers. Ash, glass shards, and leaning shoots all constrain her palette and ritual. Final image reuses the same ash-flecked light that opened the piece, now re-weighted by silence. Micro-setting (reed-as-throat) directly shapes the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mira "paint something that cannot be forgiven into something that can be borne?" Pressure escalates as each pot questions her and the reed’s metallic scream refuses to quiet until canvas is complete. Agency is decision-to-paint + refusal of coin; visible price is the transferred insomnia/stranger’s buzzing teeth. One tightening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: imperfection as survival—phoenix cracks, warped reed, color-blind sight—all converge on the final silent bloom. No moralizing; final image reprices "awakening" as endurance beside the wound. Subtext lives in gesture: stranger’s blank eyes, plant shoots "conspirators afraid of the dark." Avoids binaries: forgiveness is not promised, only the ability to stay awake.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder; perceptual signature filters world through texture & temperature, never color names. Rhythm breathes with kiln air; compression in "paint dreams for anyone willing to trade one" is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within artist-and-glassblower lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical—"embers across the dawn," "conspirators afraid of the dark"—yet every sentence advances image or cost. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors stay concrete and consistent (reed = sleeping insect = throat = bruise). Opening and closing lines frame and resolve by image. Minor elevated diction ("constellations," "trembling") fits lyric mode and is pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of color-blind painter + phoenix aftermath + plant-alphabet + concertina throat is fresh, not a trope checklist. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; integral logic holds. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specific detail ("ash in the seams," "reed tongue warped as if it swallowed fire") prevents abstraction.</comment>
