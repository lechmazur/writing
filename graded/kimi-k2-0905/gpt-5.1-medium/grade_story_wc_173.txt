<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iri’s interiority is consistently particular—her refusal to be “written on,” her calibration of gaze-timing, her choice to weave rather than jar the echoes—all manifest a lived-in contradiction between weaponized blankness and covert authorship. The embodied cost is legible: her humming body at the end carries centuries of unspent grief, making the smile an earned renunciation rather than a victor’s pose. No diagnostic self-labeling; even “chaste” is a social verdict, not self-definition. The only friction is that the palace’s status mechanics are asserted more than staged, so the power shift feels inferred rather than choreographed in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed hush reweights the palace’s rule-set—courtiers forget how to stand—while the price (Iri’s body now a conduit for every disallowed feeling) is unmistakable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-layer thickens the ambient pressure until the single exhalation detonates etiquette itself. Orientation is taught early by the snow-muted courtyard and the shimmer rising from the well; later payoff waives any debt. Causality is lyric-notated but intact—because she knits the echoes rather than bottling them, the lullaby fractures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions as both setting and instrument: its light-forgotten strands literally constrain how Iri can act—she must move alongside, never touch, turning her body into punctuation. Snow and lantern-blue return at the end as flakes that “reconsider their descent,” recharging the opening image with new semantic weight. Spatial choreography is immaculate: descent, chamber, altar, well are tracked without drift. Micro-setting (the gloves removed, the sleeves that hide folded hands) repeatedly shapes gesture and secrecy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether unspent feeling will be confiscated or weaponized—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when Iri chooses to weave rather than jar the echoes, a single decisive intensification. The cost is palpable: her body becomes the archive she can never unload, foreclosing any return to unreadability. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure grows by accretion of ghost-layers; no coincidence required. The reversal is internal—no guard arrests her—yet it reconfigures power for the entire court.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as insurgent authorship, chastity as undepleted capacity. The final image of snowfall frozen mid-air offers a non-literal answer—etiquette can be suspended, not by noise but by a denser quiet. Subtext lives in gesture: gloved removal, breath-release, the unshed tears that never become speech. No moral is declared; the question shifts from “how to obey” to “how to remember one’s own posture.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, compressing syntax—“between sigh and smile”—without tumbling into purple overload. Rhythmic control mirrors the pressure-folded light: longer sentences accumulate, then fracture into monosyllabic release: “she exhaled.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Iri notices timing, refraction, breath-length, never touristic detail. POV stays interior-third; no head-hopping, no filter-verb fatigue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: one sentence often does triple duty—image, metaphor, causal cue (“lanterns burned with a blue so soft it seemed dangerous”). Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but never violated; vehicles stay within optic/breath/sound family. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffolding: “they called her Iri, for…” reads as necessary legend, not exposition dump. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band consideration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—harvesting the residue of politely-killed feelings—is instantly fresh, yet grounded in palpable world logic: the palace predates its rulers, etiquette is a toxic containment system. The prism sanctuary reverses the typical catacomb—light, not darkness, imprisons. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than plot pivots, and it pays off when silence becomes louder than rebellion. Transformation test fails: swap setting or character and the entire emotional algebra collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: “blank page no patron had yet written on.” Development: her refusal to jar echoes into jars, choosing instead to knit them into herself. Closure: the smile that acknowledges she is no longer unreadable but newly inscribed with collective grief. Cost is embodied—she becomes the text. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Early shimmer teaches the rule: light folded until color is forgotten. Development: threads must be moved “alongside,” never touched, dictating her gestural method. Closure: the sanctuary’s hush is the payload that halts snow above. The object is both toolbox and launchpad.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Concept is stakes: king wants them confiscated, Iri wants them re-released. Each echo-thread is a mini-antagonist repeating its moment of refusal; weaving them rewrites palace firmware. Without this engine, no reversal, no courtyard freeze.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Bodily poetic” is first a metaphor, then a tactic: her posture becomes punctuation, her sleeves store hidden motion, her final exhale is the stanza-break that ends the lullaby. The cost is internal bruising from hosting centuries of feeling—visible in the humming ribs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Unlock” is literal—she unlocks recollections by sliding alongside threads, never grasping. This method differentiates her from prior harvesters and enables the final dense hush. One could substitute “release,” but the connotation of permission rather than extraction would soften the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Method is taught early (“untangling threads”) and matters tactically: touching would shatter the echo; coaxing lets it recombine. The mechanics justify her delicate ballet and the eventual braid that can be exhaled skyward.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Snow and lantern-blue compress visual bandwidth to silver, enforcing the palace’s monochrome conformity; the courtyard is the first membrane the hush must penetrate. Setting resurfaces at closure when falling flakes pause, proving the breach worked.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Between sigh and smile” frames the entire night-ritual, giving the piece its breath-length tempo. Time is tracked by bell stutters and heartbeats, but no literal clock narrows options; hence capped below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Motive is declared and dramatized: she descends to “defy the lullaby,” and every micro-choice—knit, not jar; exhale upward—reinforces that insurgency. Conflict is want vs need: she wants to stay unreadable but must sacrifice that blankness to arm the court with unmapped listening.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Alarming serenity is maintained throughout—echoes fly like birds around a burning tree, flakes hang as if reconsidering. Tone modulates into triumphant hush at the end, still serene yet now weaponized. Without this tonal coherence the rebellion would feel shrill rather than inevitable.</comment>
