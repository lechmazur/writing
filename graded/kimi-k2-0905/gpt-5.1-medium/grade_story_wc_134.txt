<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Both women register as distinct consciousnesses: Lyra’s brittle pride in foresight shatters in real time, Mira’s quiet yearning for “small miracles” drives the final transfer. The moment Lyra bows and yields the pearl crystallizes a credible shift from seer to witness, paid for by her public loss of authority. Interiority stays concrete—“vision… crack like thin ice”—and avoids label-speak. Only the absence of a deeper flaw or contradiction keeps this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s transfer reweights the stake from grand prophecy to luminous ordinary acts, and Lyra’s bow makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each musical echo thickens the pattern until the cave’s chord “sharpens by teeth” and forces the role-swap. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the “unseen forces” could be slightly more foreshadowed to earn a 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cave is no backdrop; dripping notes tickle ankles, quartz hearts pulse, and the hovering pearl literally cuts the air—environmental physics that constrain and enable the final choice. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias: Mira notices dogs’ names, Lyra hears futures stumble. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single chamber. One micro-crit: the “bright darkness” trope is repeated; trimming one instance would sharpen the 9-band claim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“who gets to define wonder?”—tightens when the cave’s chorus mutiny strips Lyra of her tool of trade and Mira’s village vignettes become the new oracle. Agency sits with Mira’s calm claim, “they want to inhabit the present,” which flips the power axis. Cost is legible: Lyra’s bow forfeits her marketable gift. The pressure curve is single but sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff 800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the ordinary is re-enchanted not by miracle but by attentive service. The pearl’s final glow over soup-stirring hands re-prices value itself—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Subtext lives in gesture: Lyra’s “nervous” lens-polishing telegraphs panic long before she speaks. Only a touch of thematic echo (“magnify everyday magic”) keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays stable, filtering each woman’s perceptions through metaphoric yet distinct palettes. Syntax flexes with pressure—short percussive clauses when the cave “breathes,” longer lyrical coils for Mira’s epiphany. No head-hopping within paragraphs. Dialogue is sparse but voice-differentiated: Lyra’s clipped “Take the pearl” against Mira’s contemplative murmur. One stray adjective—“perfectly true”—feels editorial; excising it would polish the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “dust leap like startled insects” does double sensory duty. Rhythm modulates from hushed opening to the final heartbeat sentence without template cadence. No paraphrase loops; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. A single mixed metaphor—“chord… sharpened by teeth”—is vivid enough to pass, but cleaner physical logic would secure 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inversion of the clairvoyant who fails because the future chooses to incarnate as village minutiae is fresh, and the cave-grown “music pearl” feels invented yet inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when cosmic brooms and starlit soup spoons rewire prophecy itself. The piece could only exist in this voice and place; swap the cave for a forest and the logic collapses. That specificity plus bold structural gamble earns the 9-band.</comment>
