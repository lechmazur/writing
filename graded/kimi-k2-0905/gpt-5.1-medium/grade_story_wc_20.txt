<comment>Eira’s interiority is palpably concrete—her refusal to accept “lost” is shown through the micro-choice of turning toward the foundry, not home. Contradictory impulses (stoic alchemist vs. sister who secretly followed) coexist in the same beat, not alternated. The final gesture—offering her own name as solder—earns its cost because every prior image of molten metal and corroded promises foreshadows the sacrifice. Only hairline gap: we never see her hands scald or breath snag, so the embodied price is implied rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the thirteenth constellation—“two footprints facing opposite horizons”—legibly reweights what “Wanderer” means, with the coin’s crack as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain-to-mirror, rust-to-ink, coin-to-constellation form a density chain that peaks in the luminous final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“old foundry”), well under the 120-word allowance. No lens ambiguity; every metaphor tightens the same seam between naming and fate.</comment>

<comment>The foundry’s single live coal and steaming crucible function as micro-setting, literally melting the zodiac coin that charges closure. Rain-turned-mirror and rust-turned-ink are not decorative; they foreshadow the “kintsugi” alchemy of sealing fracture with meaning. Spatial choreography is immaculate: doorway → crucible → vapor projection → night exit, each move tracked without drift. Weather is causally active: rain cools iron, feeds the crucible, and mirrors the sky that once held the constellations now being rewritten.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“redeem the word lost”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and escalates when the coin cracks, foreclosing the city’s verdict. Pressure tightens once: the vision of Arlen on the pass pins him to a single moment, forcing Eira to unsolder that freeze-frame. Cost is visible in the coin’s fissure and the luminous regret that spills out; her name is now alloyed to his undefined path. The tightening is singular but decisive, satisfying the 600-word allowance for one meaningful turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular: the foundry’s history of naming “anchors, astrolabes, bells” versus Eira’s refusal to let “missing” be the final mold. No abstract sermon; the moral calculus is embedded in the image of molten light sketching a thirteenth sign. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue—so the coin’s song and the vapor’s projection carry implication. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: two footprints, not a moral, letting ambiguity linger without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV clings to Eira’s perceptual signature: she notices “rain-washed foundry floor, each reflection bending around puddles like time refusing a straight line”—an alchemist’s geometric gaze. Syntax elongates then compresses to mirror her shift from analytical calm to crystallized stance. No head-hop; the vision of Arlen is framed as vapor projection, keeping knowledge bounded. Rhythmic control peaks in the final sentence: “tempered but unclosed”—a cadence that refuses closure while sounding like cooling metal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “promises… corroded, clung, and changed the name of whoever carried their rust” does triple lexical duty. Mixed-metaphor guard passed—rust-to-ink-to-mirror sequence stays within liquid-to-solid metal logic. No synonym churn; “solder,” “unsolder,” “fuse” recur with purposeful metallurgical precision. Single scaffold detected: “names were molds” immediately followed by “molds… poured us through them,” a micro-loop that slightly dulls an otherwise flawless surface.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy + astrology + foundry is fresh, yet the “name-as-mold” conceit is a known poetic trope; transformation comes from grounding it in the crucible’s literal heat. Risk taken: lyric density in a 740-word piece could have collapsed into purple, but restraint around embodied cost keeps it taut. Thirteenth constellation avoids gimmick because the coin’s physical crack earns the new sigil. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes; the footprints image feels newly coined.</comment>
