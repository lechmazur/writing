<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-driven passivity is credibly specific; the brother-voicemail beat embodies the “mistake like an unreturned book” and crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The micro-choice to re-pocket the invitation as promise shows visible cost. No contradictory impulses in-scene, only interior summary; that caps it at 8.9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invitation transforms from secret token to public promise, cost paid in the tear-washed space. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore linked to the voicemail revelation. One meaning-tightening beat at the gray book; no trace of outline drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Shelf curved like question marks” is environment-as-body; the crumpled invitation functions as handled tool returned in final image with reweighted meaning. Fluorescent hum and municipal grout root us early; no white-room lapse. Micro-setting meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement via listening—tightens once when the gray book forces hearing the voicemail. Cost is legible in the sob-release; options narrow from exile to staying. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the contour of refusal made legible in the voicemail truth; no sermonizing. Invitation’s shift from shame-seal to promise-scar reweights earlier material. Final image of “began at last to stay” offers non-literal answer—earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical distance is stable; perceptual signature in “municipal grout” and “nested paradoxes” is character-specific. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“world widened, life bent”) and paid off. Syntax mirrors custodial quietude; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence either advances image or emotional knowledge. “Books hummed softly” is one permitted figurative burst; no density clog. Opening and closing sentences anchor voice and re-charge motif. Rhythm breathes with the discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Secret library cataloged by regret is fresh, yet grounded in Elias’s specific guilt. Voicemail inversion—the laugh, not accusation—reconfigures familiar overdose trope. Conceptual integrity intact; no retreat to generic redemption. Risk in lyric stillness pays off with felt cost.</comment>
