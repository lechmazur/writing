<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s blindness is never used as gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (tracing cracks, calibrating wing tension) externalizes his need to “decode feedback into direction.” The final release of the drone crystallizes his quiet renunciation of sighted certainty—cost is felt in the empty space above the basin. Clara functions as pressure valve rather than crucible, so relationship beat is thin, capping score just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the drone’s departure reconfigures both artisan and machine from broken to attuned under a single audible image—the harbor bell’s Doppler fade. Causal chain holds: cracked spine → re-patch → water-refraction test → trust calibration → launch. No teleporting props or retro-fixes; every screw turned stays turned. Cost is legible in the hush after the buzz slips into fog.</comment>

<comment>Rail-depot mist, glass-tube chimes, and vibrating bench rails are not backdrop but instruments Elias plays to navigate. Micro-setting (the drone’s spine, the basin’s meniscus) directly constrains the patching tactics and final orientation test. Sensory hierarchy obeys blind POV: sound > touch > temperature; visual cues are rigorously excluded. Final image of silver mist rolling across the threshold recharges every earlier echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can broken guidance relearn direction?”—tightens through each calibration failure; stakes remain intimate yet absolute. One meaningful deepening: when Elias redirects the beak against the “singing line of water,” the drone’s whir shifts from confused to aligned—options narrow to fly or fail. No external antagonist needed; internal friction of mistrust supplies sufficient heat. Cost is the artisan’s letting-go, audible in the vanishing buzz.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: translation of fracture into flight. Motif of refraction—light bent through water, sound bent through rails—quietly reweights “direction” from visual to auditory moral compass. No thesis statements; final image offers Conceptual Repricing: the world’s call is not to be seen but to be heard and answered. Ambiguity lingers—will the drone return?—inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s haptic epistemology; diction stays within tactile and acoustic registers (“bright, dry buzz,” “hairline crack along its spine”). Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences during listening beats, staccato clauses when screws drop. No head-hopping; Clara’s dialogue is filtered through Elias’s ear, maintaining perceptual signature. Voice sustains control through the final cadence of mist and bell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“mist clung… like breath that refused to fade” sets tone then yields to concrete action. Sentence variety supports momentum: front-loaded participles only when simultaneous action is plausible. One mixed metaphor risk (“braid with the distant horns and gulls”) but cadence carries it without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind drone repair as spiritual orientation. Tropes of broken tech and sage craftsman are revitalized through sensory inversion—sightless calibration by water-refraction sonar. Risk of sentimentality is averted by unsentimental tactile detail and open-ended release. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious on first approach.</comment>
