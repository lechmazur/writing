<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jonas’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through the act of painting grids on canvas and the interior refusal “he trusted emptiness,” showing a flaw that actively shapes method. The methodical trait is repeatedly paid off: every brushstroke is a micro-choice forced by his perceptual limit, and the final image of the ribbon fluttering is the earned cost of that limit. Internal contradiction is less present; his stance is steady, so the arc leans toward crystallization rather than fracture. Still, the blindness-to-sight reversal feels inevitable and specific to this character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each layered brushstroke and mist-thick sentence adds density until the canvas reweights the cold case. Closure is a Charged Poise—ribbon image trembling in “invisible breeze,” reconfiguring empathy as the only remaining path. The quarry-stone slip at the end is the audible hinge that makes the cost felt without declaring a capture. Causality is implicit rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“places remember differently”) and lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The quarry mist is not backdrop; it constricts visibility to arm’s-length, forcing Jonas to work by touch and grid, and its chill becomes the hush that lets “ghosts lean closer.” Micro-setting inside the plastic evidence bag—the curled ribbon—functions as portable quarry, constraining every painted stroke. Spatial choreography is pristine: flashlight beam, easel legs, gravel under boot heel all stay tracked. Weather thickens until floodlights become “pale moons,” a final image that fuses setting and painting surface into one charged membrane.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are immediately legible: re-ignite a thirteen-year-cold case with one depleted artifact. Pressure tightens through accretive texture: each pigment mix, each charcoal pass narrows the possible faces until only the ribbon’s angle remains. The decisive tightening is the moment painted ribbon appears to flutter—an hallucinated motion that forces either confession or silence in whoever sees it. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the portrait will now haunt the living, not identify the dead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of the usual detective story: justice is not punitive but empathic contagion. Subtext lives in gesture—Rhea’s heel grinding gravel, Jonas’s hand hovering over canvas—rather than any articulated thesis. The final image re-weights the masquerade motif: ribbon once dismissed as “party trash” becomes the only true face, a conceptual repricing that answers the opening question of who gets seen. No moral is stated; the hush itself is the verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Jonas’s perceptual grammar: faces are “shifting puzzles,” light is “chords,” dialogue is reported as motion (“voice low as if afraid the rock would overhear”). Rhythmic control peaks under pressure: the four-beat sentence “He painted until the ribbon…seemed to flutter” lets the canvas breathe before the stone-slip crack. No head-hopping; Rhea’s interior is read through her gait, keeping distance modest. The lyric register stays anchored in occupational diction—grids, tape, charcoal—so voice never drifts into decorative abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the mist rose early from the shadowed quarry in mist” fuses setting, ominous repetition, and character entrance in one breath. No scaffold lines; each clause advances image or pressure. Metaphors are internally coherent (mist = breath of beast, ribbon = question mark) and mutually reinforcing rather than stacked. Minor template cadence in “the way she… the way she…” but it echoes methodical observation, so reads intentional rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The face-blind portraitist who paints not to identify but to infect the murderer with empathy is a fresh inversion of both detective and artist tropes. Accumulative structure—each layer of paint equals layer of time—feels uniquely suited to a cold case, avoiding linear reveal clichés. Quarry-as-studio literalizes the excavation metaphor without declaring it. The ribbon’s transformation from trash to face is an inevitable surprise that could only emerge from Jonas’s perceptual void. Risk is taken and paid off: a quiet ending where stone slips but no one is caught—empathy itself becomes the sentence.</comment>
