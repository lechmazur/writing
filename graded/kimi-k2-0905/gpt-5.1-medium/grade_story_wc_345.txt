<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kerran’s ghost-organizer identity is vivid and unique; the after-death petitioning instinct crystallizes in the chalk-route gambit. Interior contradiction appears only in the single memory-flash of hospital drowning—powerful but isolated. No embodied emotion under the final bell-shatter; the gratitude-tangle is asserted, not shown. Still, the spectral POV stays consistent and the altruistic flaw drives every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bell and lashed-together orchard drifting toward the nebula reconfigure survival itself. Causal chain holds: chalk messages → crowd trust → collective harnessing → arch-crossing. Cost is legible in the bell’s fracture and the abandoned ladders. One minor slack: the nebula “soft harbor” rule is foretold, not tested, so the final lift feels semi-mythic rather than earned physics.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock arches and the glass bell are returned to in tactile ways—chains bite, mineral ghosts cloud, auroras catch. Spatial choreography is flawless: arches collapse behind the evacuees, ladders spill like vertebrae. The butterfly-less garden’s watering bell constrains the final choice: ring until it cracks, then move. Environment is not backdrop; it is the evolving scaffold that dictates tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save orchard/community—tightens when the violet updraft begins lifting land chunks. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each chalk order increases communal investment until the bell itself fractures, reweighting cost. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive: from ghost petitions to living harnesses. Price is visible in heirlooms abandoned and bell shards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: communal altruism can survive planetary fracture if trust is re-ghosted into action. Subtext lives in the bell’s mutation from weather gauge to call-to-arms. Final image of sap-streaked faces beneath a broken but once-chiming bell reframes hope as brambled, not sweet. Avoids moral tag; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: long breathy sentences mimic orbital drift, short imperative chalk lines mimic seismic jolts. Perceptual signature—spectral organizer—filters every detail through route-mapping instinct. Diction stays other-worldly yet precise: “luminous bruise,” “discarded vertebrae.” No head-hop; ghost-narrator modestly admits inference (“they could not see me smiling”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from auroral cadence to staccato chalk commands; no template drone. Metaphors are coherent—river of gas, vertebrae ladders—and fused to POV bias. One mixed overlap: “planetary groan” beside “tired ships” is forgiven under lyric license. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence either moves crates or tilts sky.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing labor-organizer ghost with planetary ring-shedding is fresh; trope of post-death regret becomes practical logistics. Risk of nebula-as-harbor pays off because community still sacrifices heirlooms and home chunks. Specificity—insulated seedling crates, solar-paint veins—prevents abstract everywhere. Not quite 9+ because nebula rule remains imported lore, not transformed by character choice.</comment>
