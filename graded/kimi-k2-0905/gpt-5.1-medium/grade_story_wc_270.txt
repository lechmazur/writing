<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Teta Lila’s contradictory impulses—rebel matriarch and tender mentor—are dramatized in her scarred hands and calm voice blocking the council; the narrator’s plant-telepathy is embodied through slow resin-thoughts that bend choices. Interior contradiction peaks when the narrator asks the embryo a question no plant could frame, showing evolved values. Cost is legible: the amber cracks, the implanted lattice dissolves, and the council’s path is foreclosed. Micro-choice hierarchy is present, but the narrator’s final agency is slightly under-dramatized—more reported than acted—keeping it just outside 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s light bleeds into the spring, reweighting destiny itself; cost is felt in the council’s thwarted certainty and the narrator’s conscious release of control. Causal chain holds: kite-script → decoded song → amber fracture → destiny unsealed. Orientation is anchored early by steam ladders and scaffolds; no disorientation persists. One causal micro-gap: the exact mechanism by which “naming choices aloud” rewrites cellular code is asserted rather than shown, a hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Volcanic hot springs, sulfur pools, and fractured greenhouses create a living micro-setting that constrains every move: steam dictates stealth, moss conveys memory, cooled lava embodies new growth. The embryo-as-object and the bathhouse stones function as setting extensions that physically absorb and re-emit destiny. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—resin-thoughts, scent of burnt oranges—never touristic. Environment directly shapes the final image: the spring carries the light away, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom from implanted fate—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the council arrives to reclaim the embryo. One meaningful turn: the narrator’s choice to ask the embryo’s consent crystallizes agency under pressure. Cost is visible: amber cracks, council’s control is repudiated, tradition is evolved not erased. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the density shift from whispered fear to luminous release is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: tradition is a living root, not a museum piece; destiny must be chosen, not scripted. Subtext operates through images—steam ribs, resin-thoughts, sprout in lava—never thesis statements. Final image of springs dreaming their own futures offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. No moralizing or thematic echo in closing lines; complexity remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: plant-thoughts as slow resin, fear whispered through roots, scent of burnt oranges. Syntax modulates from lyrical elongation to clipped urgency during council confrontation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens credibly under stress. One minor filter-verb cluster (“I felt”) during ivy chorus, but rhythm recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences perform multiple jobs—image, motion, metaphor—without padding. Figurative language is patterned early (steam ladders, ghost ribs) and paid off at closure (sprout in lava). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“light stuttering like a candle caught between drafts and decisions”—slightly blurs physical logic, a hairline slip keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis feels inevitable: insurgent grandmother, plant-telepathy, and implanted destiny braid into a fresh meditation on evolving tradition. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, embryo as amber-bound destiny—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors novelty: kite-script language shaped like roots, moss offering grammar corrections. Transformation test fails if names or setting are swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
