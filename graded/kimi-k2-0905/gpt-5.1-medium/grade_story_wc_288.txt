<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is richly particular—watching shelves drift like ships, feeling isolation as “raw material”—and the contradiction between solitude and connection plays out in embodied micro-choices (aligning the sundial, walking toward the catalog towers). The final renunciation of despair is earned by the mirrored self’s cautionary tale and the visible cost of lingering mist. Flaw: “brittle awakenings” is abstracted twice; a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lio’s decision to “practice independence” reconfigures the library’s tides and their own stance; cost is the visible thinning of the other self into “scatter of translucence.” Causal lens holds throughout—sundial alignment summons the reflection, reflection forecloses despair, choice adjusts the floating structure. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal library is no postcard: it tilts underfoot, ladders sway, pages flutter like birds; the brass sundial’s mirror-constraint literally enables the era-walk that summons the past self. Micro-setting (the stone circle’s hum) directly powers both plot beat and thematic continuity. Atomically reflective surface reweights the final image—no external caps apply.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can solitude become livable—tightens when the reflection warns that purity led to extinction, forcing Lio to choose coexistence over mausoleum. Escalation is situational pressure: the library’s tide, the thinning reflection, the pulse-matched hum. Visible price: the other Lio dissolves, foreclosing reunion; protagonist agency drives the final adjustment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of isolation as purity → isolation as craft; the sundial’s layered faces literalize continuity without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—mist swallowing the reflection, floor tilting underfoot. Final image of “raw material” reweights prior “brittle awakenings” without sermon; ambiguity lingers about who future arrivals might be.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to Lio’s perceptual filter—cloud-currents as ships, silence as splintering—syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under choice. No head-hopping; diction (“atomically reflective”) stays within librarian-era lexicon. Minor cadence repetition in “brittle awakenings” phrase; not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density lines do triple duty: “shelves drift like anchored ships through vaporous currents” sets scene, stakes, and mood. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor coherence intact. One paraphrase loop—“isolation into independence” stated twice—minor, outside closure beat; allows 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating library + reincarnation memory + brass era-sundial synthesizes into a fresh emotional engine: solitude as tidal craft. Risk—the reflection lectures—pays off because the lecture dissolves into tangible cost. Sky whales and forest cities feel inevitable, not ornament. Transformation test fails if names change; concept is inseparable from imagery.</comment>
