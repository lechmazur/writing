<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s motive—curiosity about “borrowed time”—is dramatized through bodily contact with the cradle and the tidal breathing that syncs with their own. Interior contradiction is present: the refusal to “meddle” collides with the whispered decision to “pay in years.” The final acceptance carries a felt cost (the warmth threading foreign memories), satisfying Earned Stasis. Minor drawback: the grandfather’s role is told not tested, slightly blunting legacy pressure. </comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s warmth implants alien memories, visibly foreclosing the narrator’s prior life. Causal linkage is clean—Myra’s invitation → tactile test → whispered bargain → memory graft. The vortex rule-set is taught early (“redistribute… lose what others gain”) and charges the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“I was seventeen…”) and the glass ribs map spatially; no penalty applies. </comment>

<comment>The icebound atrium is not backdrop: the rimed balconies and blue-lit cradle physically constrain movement and focus attention. The oak acorn cap micro-setting reappears at climax, its polished rim imaging the price of fifty swapped years. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cold glass, tidal breath, frost on skin—mirroring the internal freeze/thaw. One hairline slip: “starlight” is named but never filtered through dome glass again. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of borrowed time”—is signaled in line 12 and paid when memories scrape across the narrator’s skin. Escalation is single but decisive: the egg’s answer narrows options to irreversible acceptance. Cost is visible in the final warmth that threads “other people’s yesterdays” into the narrator’s lattice. Under Accumulative lens, the density of foreign memories reweights the personal stake without external antagonist. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the spiral seam of the egg: inheritance as cyclical debt rather than gift. Subtext lives in gesture—Myra’s bloodless knuckles, the acorn laid down like a pawn. The ending refuses moral summary; instead, the image of reopened drawers implies future thefts of time. The vortex concept reprices the seed-saver ethos into stewardship of entropy itself—an oblique, resonant answer. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyric yet precise: “frozen bells,” “second heart,” “storm humming itself to sleep.” Perceptual signature is seed-centric—every object is weighed for germination potential. Syntax contracts under pressure—“I whispered that I would pay in years”—matching the tidal hush. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from panoramic starlight to skin-level warmth. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is compressed and rhythmic; sentence variety avoids monotony. Figurative language is high but patterned—cold, spiral, tidal—teaching the vortex motif early. No mixed metaphors; “wild serenity” is intentionally oxymoronic. One template cadence—“I came… I answered… I thought”—is repeated only once and serves as ritual framing, not artifact. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The seed-of-time premise is non-obvious and commits fully: entropy mortgage on living memory. Risk is taken in lyric exposition, yet payoff is visceral. Transformation test fails if oak/acorn/egg are swapped—specificity is irreplaceable. Fresh inflection: seed-saving becomes temporal activism, not nostalgia. </comment>
