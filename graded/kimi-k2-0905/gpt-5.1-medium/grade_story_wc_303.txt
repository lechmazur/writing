<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The researcher’s refusal to authenticate is earned by the accumulating plant-whispers and coffee-stain doubts; the interior contradiction between scholarly duty and moral revulsion is palpable. The final marginalia act crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible professional cost. Only the telepathy trait remains a shade too convenient, slightly blunting the flaw-compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the annotated contract reweights truth itself, melting the violin and the empire’s myth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (ivy hiss, coffee sigil, river memory) tightens the stake until the refusal ruptures the frame. Cost is legible in the single water drop that seals the loss of both grant and song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet observatory’s hush, capped telescopes, and sweating plinth are selectively filtered through the narrator’s curatorial gaze; every tactile detail constrains the choice to touch or withhold authentication. The ice violin itself functions as micro-setting, its condensation mirroring the protagonist’s wavering. Final crack and drop re-environment the entire room with irrevocable loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus institutional lie—escalates through each sensory annotation: plant gossip, coffee prophecy, river memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when the violin’s hairline crack audibly reclaims its river past, forcing the annotative refusal that forecloses replication. Cost is felt in the simultaneous evaporation of funding and song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: archival certainty is porous, empires drown their own evidence, and refusal can be the only fidelity. The reweighted violin—once relic, now returning water—offers a resonant, non-moral answer: truth liquefies under scrutiny. No thematic echo pollutes the final image; the drop speaks louder than any verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a precise curatorial lexicon—“provenance,” “paper spine,” “marginalia”—yet modulates into lyric compression under pressure. Perceptual signature is vivid: plants murmur metaphors, coffee stains map empire. No head-hop; the single POV sustains psychic distance even during the telepathic overload, keeping inference legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathless coils to the final fragment “like a signature I refused to give,” mirroring the crack’s release. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each metaphor (sequin stars, paper guillotine, mulberry ache) returns as charged image at closure. One near-loop—“every vine…every citrus…every weed”—reads as intentional vegetative cascade rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ice violin as archival object that reverts to river mid-authentication is a fresh, inevitable synthesis of climate-anxious museology. Telepathic botany could feel gimmicky yet here externalizes the scholar’s buried guilt. Risky lyric density pays off when the final drop reprises every prior water image, making the fantastical feel legally binding.</comment>
