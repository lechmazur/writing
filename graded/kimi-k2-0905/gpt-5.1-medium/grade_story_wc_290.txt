<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The explorer’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are embodied in every beat—measuring corridors aloud, forcing himself onward while lungs tighten. His grandmother’s spatial-mutiny myth is not backstory filler; it primes his decision to insert the compass point and descend. The final choice to accept transformation is earned by a lifetime of obsessive curiosity colliding with on-page terror. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the staircase of “compressed midnight” appears, cost is felt (he may lose his body or mind), and the lens stays Situational—space keeps folding in reluctant sighs. Causality is clean: broken compass → socket click → organ breath → geometry bruised → staircase. No teleporting props, no resets. The Orientation Test is waived because deliberate early disorientation (“distances lied”) pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment is a character: canyon walls “press like accusations,” temple angles disagree with intuition, star-beam becomes a “disciplined column” that tames the mutiny. Micro-setting—the compass point in his trembling hand—literally rewrites floor plans. Sensory hierarchy mirrors claustrophobia: hearing bone-vibration, tasting dust/thunder, seeing slit windows that did not exist from outside. Spatial choreography is flawless; every impossible angle is tracked from his moving POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the key before space crushes him—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when “air might tighten until his ribs protested.” Single meaningful deepening: the brass tube’s silent chord bruises geometry and forces the staircase; no option but descent. Cost is visceral: breath shortening, balance kneeling, final acceptance of unknown bodily risk. Escalation is situational, not causal-reversal, but coherence and price are undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: curiosity as wistful rebellion against entropy and forgetting. No moral stated; instead, the image of a “buried lung” waiting for breath reweights the premise—exploration is inhalation, but the temple exhales. Spatial mutiny motif stays particular, never abstract slogan. Final descent offers resonant ambiguity: is he liberator or next sacrifice? Counter-readings thrive without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained tremor: syntax lengthens and compresses like the corridors themselves (“walls shivering nearer in imagination”). Diction stays within a surveyor’s lexicon—angles, flagstones, arc, socket—yet turns lyrical under stress. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent claustrophobe: starlight is “stitched silver lattice,” air “tastes of old thunder.” Rhythmic control peaks at the chord beat: fragments give way to long sentence of reluctant sigh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent under spatial-mutiny logic (“folding like wounded wings”) and never mixed. Information density high: one line does world-rule, emotion, and tactile detail (“The sanctuary within was not large, yet the angles…”). No filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence mirrors descent—sentence shortens to “he descended,” accepting the key might change him first—prose becomes the staircase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lost temple, portal key, cursed explorer—are inverted through architectural body-horror: space itself is the antagonist. Brass organ tube repurposed as temple-lung is fresh; spatial mutiny as literal rather than metaphorical rebellion risks high but lands. Specificity irreversible: only this compass tip snapped at that arc could unlock this geometry. Wistful rebellion tone synthesized with claustrophobia yields memorable emotional truth.</comment>
