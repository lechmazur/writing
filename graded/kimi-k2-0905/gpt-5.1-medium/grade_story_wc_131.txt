<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marrow’s “kindly methodical” nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices (winding tape, palming joists) and his ache to be “visible” drives every beat; the final silent intervention shows credible endurance with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. One minor slip: the librarians’ biographies are delivered in quick summary capsules rather than dramatized need, muting secondary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marrow’s realization “he was visible now… through their own awakened senses” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean—tape find → playback → stranger’s collapse—tightening once. Orientation is swift; no penalties. The single beat of escalation suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Library crawl-space, emergency lanterns, and the cracked cassette player are filtered through Marrow’s biased attention; each tactile detail (rusty bracket, cobweb tape) constrains his delicate movements and charges the final hiss drifting through the vent. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound during the outage, mirroring Marrow’s heightened listening. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating bodies or props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Marrow’s need to matter—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens when the tape fragment gives him a tool to act. The playback choice narrows his options from passive cache-building to active emotional provocation, costing him anonymity. Pressure grows accumulatively: silence → discovery → transmission → witnessed breakdown. Cost is legible in the librarian’s collapse and Marrow’s self-exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of invisible caretaking emerges organically through Marrow’s caches and the tape’s resurrection of buried pain; no authorial thesis is declared. The final image—Marrow planning “next quiet intervention”—invites reflection on anonymous kindness without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: the cassette hiss replaces spoken comfort. Complexity is honored; no tidy uplift is forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marrow’s perceptual signature—“palms flat, knees finding every joist”—with rhythmic, methodical syntax that mirrors his caretaker precision. No head-hopping; librarians’ memories are mediated solely through tape-triggered sense data. Diction remains within Marrow’s plausible lexicon; no register drift. Voice modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the playback release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“tape… cling like cobweb”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“juddered,” “exhaled”) carry motion. One negligible filter verb cluster (“he heard… he saw”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—hollow-bone librarian-ghost healing strangers via salvaged sense-memory—feels fresh, grounded in concrete detail rather than quirk. Risky second-person-adjacent wish (“to become visible to those who need you”) is fully earned through causality. Tape-as-memory-conduit transforms a familiar found-object trope into specific emotional circuitry. If relocated to another building or object, the story’s spine would fracture; integration is total.</comment>
