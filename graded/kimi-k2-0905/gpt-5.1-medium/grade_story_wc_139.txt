<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is sharp and embodied (“his chest is open… a quiet red cavern”), with contradictory impulses held in scene. The final micro-choice—splitting the ledger—grows credibly from the narrator’s lifelong role as the honest holder of coats. No stock labels; moral arithmetic stays character-bound. Cost is felt in the closing image of “living imbalance,” capping the arc with earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: father’s death → cylinder found → ink used → narrator rewrites equation → dawn hand-off. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “mathematics of a fair trade” is redefined on the page, with the narrator’s initials enacting the cost. Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Mercy Street Funeral Home, prep room, tonight”). Persistent constraint—the ink’s liquefaction of certainty—shapes every tactical rereading of the equations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prep-room micro-setting constrains every move: fluorescents, formaldehyde, the metal table, the cylinder taped “where no respectful mortician would slice.” Bodies, tools, and distances track without drift; the ink pot is handled in multiple beats, its surface tension changing as the narrator’s thinking loosens. Sensory selection remains urgent—smell of formaldehyde, chill of the cavity—mirroring the narrowing ethical choices. Final image of “different lungs” is charged by this sterile, death-tinged air.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—political asylum versus exposing the entire fraud network—is signaled in paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when the narrator discovers the unfinished equation bearing his initial, forcing a live choice: disclose all or redirect half the stolen stream. Cost is visible: splitting the ledger risks consulate refusal yet keeps refugee couriers alive. Agency remains causal under the ink-altered lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete ledger math rather than assertion: every theft paired with a mercy, culminating in the narrator’s handcrafted imbalance. Subtext lives in silence—the father’s stitched chest, the ink pot’s quiet surface—never explained. Final image reweights “fair trade” as an unresolved, living debt rather than balanced books. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is felt through the reconfigured equation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a mortician’s cool precision: “organs bagged and numbered,” “puzzle cooled to room temperature,” syntax tightening under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—numbers become rivers, cliffs become wet clay—without register drift. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue stays in character-bound lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during the ink-induced dissolve, mirroring loosened cognition, then steadies for the surgical cut of the final choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stolen public funds slid quietly into private coffers” does three jobs in eight words. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is limited to two controlled metaphors that echo the theme. Sentence rhythm varies from short scalpel cuts to longer liquefied cascades. Final line cadence lands cleanly, recharging “last trick breathes on” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses forensic noir with moral algebra—fresh without gimmickry. The inheritance-as-equation device grows organically from the father’s grifter mythology and the narrator’s honest calculus. Specific detail—cylinder taped along the spine, ink that “liquefies rigid thinking”—prevents generic transplant. Risk of split-ledger ethics is fully embraced, yielding a non-obvious but inevitable closure.</comment>
