<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Jae’s split loyalties are dramatized through the burning stone chip and covert night meetings; the embodied cue keeps interior conflict alive. Micro-choices—handing Lilo parcel data, sweating under Council questions—show cost. Final paralysis is credible, but the emotional fallout is stated (“I wondered”) rather than tasted; we’re told the cost more than we feel it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: data → graffiti → neighborhood drift → Council suspicion. Closure is a Charged Poise: the serpent mural reframes stay-or-flee with visible stakes, no neat answer. One minor scaffold: “I thought, naively…” explains rather than dramatizes the hubris beat; costs still register in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Carnival-as-raft is more than backdrop—mooring strength, pump failures, and sight-lines to investor yachts directly shape tactics. Environmental detail is filtered through Jae’s urban-planner gaze, never touristy. Phosphorescent paint, rusted coaster, and satellite-feed visibility create sensory hierarchy. The stone chip acts as micro-setting that constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep people housed—tightens as each graffiti cipher forecloses lease options. Escalation is textural: pattern density of warning symbols increases, buyout rumors intensify, Council suspicion congeals. Protagonist agency drives every beat (data passed, maps painted, lies told). The felt cost is legible but slightly under-fleshed; we track tactics more than bodily toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: zoning maps vs. carnival labyrinth critiques legibility demanded by capital. Subtext lives in spray-coded swallow/eye icons—community literacy invisible to investors. Final serpent image offers resonant re-pricing without moralizing. One echo of prompt-speak—“navigate gentrification”—slips into exposition, muting subtlety a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a planner’s diction—data habit, evacuation vectors, title deeds—without drifting into jargon soup. Rhythm modulates: longer, hypotactic sentences when parsing risk; staccato admissions under Council glare. Perceptual signature is sharp (“lasers of color,” “slow, hungry sharks”). Dialogue from Lilo is distinctively paint-stained and idiomatic, separating the two voices cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—world-building plus emotional tilt: “noise and neon tides” compresses carnival + exhaustion. Occasional scaffold: “I thought, naively…” tells us an irony we already see. Mixed trope “foundation stone chip hung warm as if remembering” is borderline sentimental but brief. Otherwise clean propulsion; no loops or register drift in closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as gentrification battleground feels fresh; graffiti-as-evacuation-map marries art and survival in a way standard protest placards do not. Specificity—“flood dragons,” “constellations of arrows”—prevents allegory from turning abstract. Premise twist is less radical than execution; still, synthesis of city-planning espionage with street art yields memorable friction.</comment>
