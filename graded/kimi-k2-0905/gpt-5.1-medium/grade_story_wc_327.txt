<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—accepting the diamond’s curse to save a language while knowingly braiding himself into its erasure—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the stone to the wall, accepting his voice joining the bone choir). His refusal to retreat (Earned Stasis) carries visible cost: his own voice becomes part of the canyon’s dying lexicon. The only drag is slight over-articulate interiority in peak beats; diagnostic label-speak is avoided, but the throat-scratch syllables edge close. Still, motivation scales neatly from personal mission to self-sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the instant his voice fuses with the canyon, the language is reborn yet he is irretrievably woven into its bone dust—cost felt in the sparkling powder falling. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each texture-note adds density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), lens taught early via cranes-grammar analogy, pattern intact. No causal plot holes; every echo is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon’s jagged vs. polished walls literally shape the rising vowels he must speak; the flawed diamond’s micro-fractures act as micro-setting that refracts his options. Bone towers shedding sparkling powder becomes the charged final image, reconfiguring stakes mid-breath. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—he reads stone texture as phonemes, never touristy. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens when each texture he translates costs him personal voice equity. One decisive deepening: accepting the curse fuses his copper veins into the canyon’s breath, foreclosing any future extraction of self from sound. Agency is continuous (whispering, tilting, aligning to birds) and the price is legible in the sparkling bone dust that ends the scene. Under Accumulative lens, density and cadence shift fulfill escalation without needing external reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transmission always devours the transmitter. Subtext is carried in gesture (tracing his own veins) and the final dust-fall that reweights the opening “copper-veined” image into a shared skeletal alphabet. No sermonizing; insight is earned through the physical act of voicing stone. The ending’s resonant image refuses tidy moral, inviting counter-readings about whether salvation or erasure wins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless: every noun is filtered through a translator-sensory lens—stone texture = phoneme, bird spiral = syntax. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short percussive clauses under tunnel stress, elongated vowel-lines when he sings the new tongue. No head-hopping; lyric compression is pattern-taught (cranes passage) and paid off at closure. Register stays within a weathered traveler’s diction; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence either advances sonic translation or deepens atmosphere; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“black throat swallowing every stray sound”) and never obscures causality. Opening and closing lines act as tuning forks for the entire piece. Minor scaffold: “quietly articulate” appears twice—acceptable as motif anchor, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of linguist-archaeologist-cantor is fresh; no trope checklist here. Risk—turning setting into phoneme generator—pays off because canyon walls literally constrain which sounds can be born. Conceptual integrity holds: the curse is never soft-reset, the language reborn is explicitly hybrid, not pure. The final bird flock echoing tunnel rhythm feels inevitable yet unforeseeable, satisfying the hindsight test.</comment>
