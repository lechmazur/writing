<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is sharp—her “chains as price for time” choice is embodied and contradictory. The Overseer stays a blunt status-prop; no secondary pressure from guards. Final micro-choice—guiding his hands away from ruin—earns its stasis, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the chained liberator flaw/competence balance feels individual, not archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: seed vault → cuffs → piano key sequence → vault door/ruin toggle. The arrow’s circuit-map is taught early and paid off in the final bench manipulation; closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s whispered redirection reweights risk without detonating the building. Cost is legible: her knowledge might still die with her if the wall falls wrong. One transition (piano hauled forward) is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Popcorn oil, mildewed boxes, sun-faded victory posters—each sense detail is filtered through Mara’s planter-eye. The piano bench becomes a micro-setting that literally gates the vault; its warped veneer and locked lid constrain tactics. Spatial choreography tracks as keys spill between strings and Overseer curses. Environment charges the final image: the dusty arrow humming above while Mara redirects the key-order below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the seeds—tightens when the Overseer’s cataloguing threatens double obliteration: vault revealed, then demolished. One meaningful escalation: Mara’s cough-forced key-spill narrows her option to verbal misdirection, raising exposure risk. Cost is conceptual but felt: her body stays chained, her mind gambles on his ego. Agency is patient strategy rather than explosive heroics—fits the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: resilience as something you plant, not escape. The seed vault’s anonymity mirrors Mara’s own buried agency; both must stay hidden to survive. Final image—her soft guidance of enemy hands—re-prices liberation as rootedness, not flight. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight to Mara; perceptual signature is tactile and chemical—she smells rain memories in plastic. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses into stubbed clauses during the key-spill. No head-hopping; Overseer’s interior kept at gesture level. Filter verbs (“she watched”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Read-aloud rhythm pulses with chain-rasp and key-clink.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “ticket stubs like molted scales” does double sensory + world decay work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay physically coherent—circuit-board feathers, sunburned veneer. One strained phrase: “countdown she had no clock for” edges toward abstraction but is saved by sonic echo. Closure line—“she spoke softly, guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace”—lands clean, no purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia tropes (wall breach, seed vault, chained rebel) are re-wired through carnival residue and circuit-board archery prize. The piano-as-cipher and popcorn ghosts give the world a tactile idiosyncrasy. Risk: letting the insurgent breach happen off-page, but that off-stage violence sharpens Mara’s rooted stance. Transformation test passes—swap carnival for any ruin and the emotional circuitry collapses.</comment>
