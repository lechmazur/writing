<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her fingers read the sigil “like braille”—and her motive to map post-collapse belief is dramatized through the tape ritual. The contradiction between nostalgia for data-driven certainty and her tactile cartomancy is present but could be sharper under direct threat. Jonas functions as skeptic pressure, not crucible; their joint placement of cards is the first micro-choice that re-weights their alliance, earning the change. Flaw is intellectual hubris rather than visceral risk; still, the cartomancer voice feels individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: crash → analog whispers → tape-map → confide → joint laying of cards that reconfigures their future options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared axis “quietly began to form,” crystallizing lateral culture with felt opportunity cost—the city still dies outside. Orientation anchored by word 80, lens taught by 25% and held. Persistent constraint—their map is literally on the floor—shapes tactics; no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and dangling cables are re-used, not catalogued; water “travels the glass like cautious comets” mirrors their tentative path-making. The measuring tape is micro-setting that constrains every card placement, charging the final image. Grandma-dust is shorthand backstory, but loft grid-loss is shown via “mute, obsolete machines.” Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can meaning be rebuilt after digital collapse?—is signaled in line 3. Tightening occurs when Mara confesses the pattern circles back to “us,” forcing Jonas to choose complicity or exit; cost is the forfeiture of anonymity and the labor of analog mapping. Agency remains internal—confide, co-lay cards—but forecloses prior solitude. No coincidence; pressure is accumulative-textural, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—belief as infrastructure you rebuild sideways, not up—emerges from tape geometry rather than assertion. Subtext in Jonas dripping glitter-shoulders signals fragile glamour even critics still wear. Final image of “something patiently unknown” offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity about whether map will work is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third close limited stays strictly with Mara; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—city “relearning analog time between the drips”—marries auditory and haptic metaphors. Prose modulates from lyrical to spare under Jonas’s skepticism. Dialogue only two lines, but idiom difference (her cosmic, his battery-tech) is clean.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sentence for spiral deal, fragment “Both” under pressure. High information density—“each centimeter corresponded to a card, each card to a choice, each choice to a culture”—yet no fillers. Metaphors (comets, lattice) stay consistent; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops; scaffolding removed.</comment>

<comment>Post-crypto cartomancy with tailor’s tape as world-mapping engine is fresh synthesis; not another “tarot in near-future” trope. Lateral-vs-vertical growth re-angles fallen-skyline imagery. Risk of unnamed sigil pays off when it becomes the axis of shared future. Specificity—“analog alleys the algorithms could not audit”—grounds novelty in lived detail.</comment>
