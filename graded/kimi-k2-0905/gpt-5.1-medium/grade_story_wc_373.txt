<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Loretta’s hunger to “hear trust break” is a vivid, character-specific desire that drives every step; her micro-choices—whispering the forbidden name, clutching the fob, staying till dawn—embody the moon-runner’s discipline and the daughter’s revolt. The interior contradiction (loyalty vs. need to wound) is alive in-scene, not summarized. Father remains off-page, so status crucible is waived; the old woman is plot furniture, not relationship pressure, so no penalty. Final endurance—collecting bruises like jars—earns its cost through prior causality; the emotional price is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Loretta’s stance crystallizes as she chooses to keep listening, the truce of hush now internalized; cost is legible in the phrase “her unease settled beside her like company she had chosen.” Causal lens holds throughout: each beat advances because/therefore—coins for fob, fob for memory, memory for renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 10; no ambiguity at end. No artifact touches the final image; rhythm and propulsion remain intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pirate market under the pier is not backdrop; the soft planks, lantern swallow, and barn-wood stalls constrain Loretta’s stealth route and tempo. The watch fob itself becomes micro-setting—its cold weight against her thigh re-grounds her after the sonic blow. Sensory hierarchy obeys her backwoods training: ears before eyes, smell of rot before color. Final image reuses the pier’s decay as a destined seat, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the fob actually plays the memory, foreclosing her last excuse for her father. Agency is interior but active: she keeps asking, keeps listening, chooses to stay. Cost is visceral: the stagger, the burn in her palm, the muffled market. No coincidence; escalation is purely driven by her insistence under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inheritance versus eavesdropping: the daughter commandeers the family trade of listening in the dark, but bottles betrayal instead of liquor. Subtext thrives in gesture—the woman’s knuckle-roll, Loretta’s belt-loop chain—never explained. Final image of “company she had chosen” reweights the premise: knowledge is now her illicit cargo. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the bruises will ferment or explode.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled backwoods cadence: selective, sensor-driven, wary of excess light. Syntax elongates in stealth moments (“where the planks went soft underfoot”) then fractures under sonic blow—“clutching the fob as if it burned.” Perceptual signature is unmistakable: lantern-light swallowed, creek-rock cold, jars carried like secrets. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines are terse, idiomatic, goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high—every sentence both advances and textures: “salt charms, teeth that remembered every bite.” Figurative control holds; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm modulates with pressure, never drifts into template cadence. Only micro-slip: “curiously steadfast calm” repeats the prompt adverb; a −0.2 nudge keeps it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “sound of trust breaking” as audible commodity is a fresh angle on familiar daddy-issue noir. Pirate-market-as-distillery inversion—where memories are distilled instead of liquor—feels inevitable in hindsight. Watch-fob-as-phonograph is an old trope but retooled through backwoods ears, not steampunk gears. Risk is taken and paid off: lyric stillness after sonic violence without losing causality.</comment>
