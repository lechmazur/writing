<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for the valley’s voice yet steeling herself to steal it—stays embodied in the hush she waits for and the lamp she sets down. Her quietly inspired trait is not label-only: it surfaces in the moment she whispers a smugglers’ counter-seal and tips the jar, trading obedience for the tangle of voices. The cost is visible: the warehouse’s new silence will mark her as traitor at dawn. One micro-choice—loosening the lid—reconfigures her stance and the city’s future; the canyon’s chord becomes her earned, perilous stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: because the cliffs stop humming, therefore Mara can hear and steal the echo; because she unscrambles buttons, she locates the crate. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3 and again at the lamp placement, well inside the 120-word window. The closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the prophecy-to-law pipeline is ruptured when the echo is freed, a repricing that makes Mara's treason irreversible. One minor ellipsis—how she learned the counter-seal—is motivated by prior mention of "old smugglers’ songs" and does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: its glowing resin panes and chalk-smudged crates constrain movement (guards trust cliffs, not indexes) and supply the concealed jar. Buttons on the crate become tactile constellation map; the sea’s audible distance outside mirrors the valley’s lost expanse inside. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp set down, lid loosened, chord spilling aisle-ward. Environment charges the final image—the warehouse breathing new silence—so the 9-gate is satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear by paragraph 2: prevent the Council from ossifying prophecy into law. Escalation is single but meaningful: locating the crate narrows options to one irrevocable act—release the echo. The tightening forces a trade-off: Mara gains raw possibility but loses personal safety, a cost legible in the dawn-foreshadowed "truth unravels." Agency drives the turn; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of "shared wisdom" into shared cacophony: the valley’s braided chord refuses the Council’s single decree. No final moral is stated; the closing image of the warehouse breathing new silence offers a non-literal answer—wisdom is polyphony, not obedience. Subtext in the button map smuggles rebellion through mundane objects. Ambiguity lingers: chaos or democracy may follow, but the story refuses to choose, embracing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mara’s perceptual signature: "dust floated like slow constellations" filters through her cataloguer’s eye. Syntax mirrors emotional tempo—long cadences while waiting, clipped fragments ("She loosened the lid a fraction") at the peak. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses only under the pressure of the thickening air. Voice-driven elision ("she had pieced together") is taught early and paid off when the counter-seal works.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: staggered sentence lengths carry the hush, then tighten into sibilance as the echo spills. Information density is high—each button color encodes shelf geography; no scaffolding repeats. One mixed metaphor ("constellation" for dust and again for buttons) is minor enough to keep clarity intact. No loops or register drift in the closure beat; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The confiscated-voices warehouse and button-cartography feel fresh, not inventory-checklist. Synthesis of geology, smuggler folklore, and bureaucratic prophecy is specific to this text; swap buttons or amber and the whole mapping collapse. Risk in letting the echo flood the entire warehouse rather than be recaptured pays off—the chord becomes a new unpredictable archive. Inevitable in hindsight, yet non-obvious at outset.</comment>
