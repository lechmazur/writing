<comment>Elias’s “methodically curious” temperament is embodied in how he measures the millimeter he later lies awake missing; the same trait drives his decision to re-open the chapel “only as a place to listen,” a renunciation that costs him certainty. Interiority stays concrete—he “feels his guardedness flex,” sees “the millimeter widen into a road.” The absence of on-page opposition dilutes pressure, so the final choice, while earned, lacks a crucible moment; still, the quiet endurance fits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the chapel shifts from “unknown” ruin to active listener, and Elias’s mandate to reopen it “only as a place to listen” reweights the entire premise with social cost—the museum must now guard silence, not artifacts. Causality holds: the map tear → missing chapel → footage → apology → new use. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early by the repeated image of listening to silence, and the final cadence crystallizes meaning without causal contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is not backdrop but micro-setting that constrains action: boots hover above painted fragments, gray-haired woman apologizes to wounded walls. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices walnut grain, tape smell, the diagonal tear—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: monitor beside reel player, lens tilt down slick stairs. The final image of the chapel-as-listener is charged by these tactile particulars; environment shapes the exact closure mandate.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls the meaning of silence—tightens once: from “archive seals reports” to Elias’s counter-mandate to keep the chapel open for listening. One meaningful deepening: the second reel shows frescos further damaged, proving prior human intrusion failed. Cost is conceptual but legible: the museum must now curate absence, not presence. Agency is Elias’s interpretation act, not physical heroics—appropriate to lens, yet the turn is single; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as unpaid debt. The fresco saints with erased faces, the sealed reports, the woman’s lip-pressed plea accrue into a pattern that reweights the chapel from relic to confessor. Final image—“only as a place to listen”—offers non-literal answer: preservation of silenced speech. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers: will silence now be curated or finally heard? The return of the tear-line “dividing known from unknown” crystallizes the thematic repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise: “maps the way other people dealt in memories,” “millimeter he had removed,” “nostalgia for weather and recording.” Syntax mirrors map-framer’s mind—measured, parenthetical, alert to edges. No head-hopping; Mara’s dialogue is filtered through Elias’s guarded openness. Compression is taught early (“a smudge like a doorway”) and paid off in final “doorway” of listening. Rhythm accelerates subtly during reel comparison, then settles into quiet cadence at close.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “walnut borders around old paper worlds” does double work—craft and metaphor—with no scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative control holds even at closure—“a body of stone trained over centuries to hold unspoken confessions”—without purple drift. One mixed metaphor risk: “millimeter widen into a road” is saved by prior calibration of Elias’s precision obsession.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of map-framing craft with archaeology of silence feels inevitable yet fresh; the tear as auditory fault-line transforms standard ruin-exploration trope. Risk: silent footage as primary evidence could read gimmicky, but pattern is taught early and paid off in final listening mandate. Specificity—“magnetized tape smell,” “woolen hats,” “graphite smudge”—anchors novelty. The chapel not as haunted but as wounded listener offers non-obvious moral calculus: preservation = custodianship of silence, not exposure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph frames craft; beats: agrees to commission, studies reels, redefines reopening; closure: mandates listening. Irreplaceable—only a map-framer would measure absence in millimeters and convert tear into auditory mandate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Appears in both reels, anchors spatial descent, frescos’ damage quantifies apology. Could be swapped for another prehistoric structure, but “rain-scoured” specificity ties to moor weather and erosion theme, earning mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Core concept drives every beat: legend motivates dig, apology shapes second reel, Elias rewrites its use. Closure mandate—“only as a place to listen”—directly reweights “whispered” property; remove chapel, entire logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Trait visible in millimeter obsession, reel comparison, refusal to lip-read but feel rhythm. Enables final interpretive leap; costs him certainty—he must endorse silence over proof. Label avoided; curiosity enacted through tactile choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Single decisive external action: Elias advises reopening—but only to listen. Transforms museum policy from excavation to custodianship; forecloses archival secrecy. Action is verbal yet causal under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Method taught early, mechanics matter: first reel shows eager breach, second shows colder apology. Comparison reveals escalating damage and guilt, forcing Elias’s reinterpretation. Without dual footage, no evidence of failed first intrusion.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting supplies moral pressure: fragility of painted saints, prohibition on boot contact, rain ingress. Vault’s deterioration quantifies cost of human intrusion, justifying shift from discovery to listening.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Map tear introduced early as metaphoric clock: dividing known/unknown. Time tightens when second reel shows ten-year decay; however, no live deadline—more contemplative than urgent. Still, temporal gap enables Elias’s stance shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Motivation declared by Mara, enacted by Elias: he chooses not to hear words but to feel silence. Friction: empathy conflicts with archival duty to expose. Cost is professional—he endorses intangible silence over tangible artifact.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tone modulates from guarded curiosity to open listening; “shielded openness” is literalized in Elias’s refusal to film yet willingness to advise. Final crystallization—museum must now shield silence—recharges opening image of map tear as portal.</comment>
