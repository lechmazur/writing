<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—profit-minded broker yearning to “uplink silent contributors”—is dramatized in the moment he offers the envelope; the cost is the visible risk to his hard-nosed reputation. Marin’s “whimsically attentive” trait is more than label: it drives her reshelving duet with Elias and seeds the later reading scheme. Relationship under pressure emerges when she tests his motives (“What did the letter lose…?”), forcing him to articulate a new value system. The final choice—fund the workers’ readings—forecloses his old, purely mercantile path with felt social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: mis-delivered letter → Elias’s curiosity → library encounter → co-planned reading series, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “new commerce” of gratitude is conceptually repriced on-page (“slowly learn a new commerce”). Cost is legible: Elias commits money/time and publicly realigns his identity. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Breezy library under stars” is not backdrop but active resource: open doors let salt air turn pages, guiding Elias inside; lanterns later become the emblematic prop for the reading scheme. Micro-setting of the envelope and locket constrains every beat—Elias fingers it, Marin re-centers it, both treat it as contract. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; sensory economy favors sound (sea, symphony fade) and touch (paper, locket, shelf edges). Final image re-weights the lanterns as social currency, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to redistribute recognition—tightens when Marin’s humility threatens to eclipse the project; the micro-turn is her acquiescence to read the letter aloud. Escalation is causal: each admission (his forgotten gratitude, her anonymity) narrows the option of retreat. Visible price: Elias pledges funds and reputation. Coincidence (mis-delivered letter) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet labor’s value emerges through the envelope’s journey rather than assertion; no overt moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: Elias reshelving almanacs beside Marin literalizes class bridging. Final “new commerce” line offers conceptual repricing without sermon. The locket’s return inside the envelope recharges earlier image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Free-indirect voice carries Elias’s cargo-broker diction (“steering a ship out of its habitual, rutted channel”) without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for his cautious exuberance, short beats at whispered admissions. Dialogue indirection—“I believe this belongs to you, or perhaps to the idea of you”—carries status tension. No head-hopping; Marin’s interior is inferred through Elias’s perception, maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform dual work: “He opened it out of habit, expecting invoices, and instead found...” advances plot and reveals trait. No paraphrase loops; figurative language is sparse and tied to maritime lexicon. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. One minor scaffold: “the hour after the symphony ends” is repeated almost verbatim; −0.2 but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—broker reroutes thank-you letter to start micro-cultural revolution—is fresh. Transformation of “lantern” from literal light to social currency feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of sentimental uplift is skirted by Elias’s retained shrewdness and the library’s salt-practical setting. Dockworker marginalia detail particularizes world without quaintness.</comment>
