<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory mix of cosmic trust and bodily awkwardness is dramatized through bare feet on cold deck plating; the opera glasses as talisman show micro-choice under pressure; final communiqué is earned by prior interior build-up; no second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sent communiqué crystallizes risk under the humming stones; “Meet at the stones…” carries undeniable social cost; inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds; persistent opera-glass constraint and barefoot contact with vibrating deck anchor the cost in concrete image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spaceport repair bay, rusted deck, stone circle with hazard stripes create tactile micro-setting; barefoot sensation and opera-glass framing filter perception; environment guides choice by humming feedback; final image of stones as coals keeps setting active.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping rebellion embers alive—tightens when Liora decides to risk the message; pressure escalates from quiet lull to concrete action; Accumulative lens: density of memory-images reweights cost; price is legible: exposure of rebels via traceable comm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of coherent chaos emerges through stone-memory and opera-glass reframing; no moralizing, only the question of what quietly reignites; final image answers without statement; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “margin of daylight,” “cathedral arches of dead freighters”; barefoot perception governs sensory hierarchy; no dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; consistent free-indirect rhythm with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines double-duty (e.g., “serenity with teeth”); rhythmic variation between long breath and fragment; only micro-loop is “hum of an ancient stone circle” used twice in close proximity (paraphrase −0.2); closure beat clean of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stone circle inside spaceport is fresh synthesis; barefoot stargazer with opera glasses reverses typical tech gaze; lull-in-rebellion frame refines familiar insurgency trope; risk-taking stays coherent and heightens stakes.</comment>
