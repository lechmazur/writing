<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the narrator’s trembling, sensory saturation, and obsessive attention to footprints and sap-shoes make the “texture of time” personal. Contradictory impulses—reverie vs. warning drum of the heart—co-exist in the final stride onto the bridge, so the moment feels psychologically real. No secondary character on page, so status and relational bullets N/A. The renunciation/dissolution is foreshadowed by earlier root-clasps and photo-burns, so the cost feels earned rather than abstract. Voice slips once into diagnostic-speak (“hyperbolic geometry”) but recovers immediately through sensory offset, so only a hairline deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist steps into a pupil-like water that refuses reflection, dissolving outline and chronology; the cost is the erasure of self as separate observer, legible in “our histories smeared into one quaking reverie.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat adds sensory density (photos bleaching, sap shoe-prints, halo flickers) until the lattice image re-weights the premise. Causality is internal but coherent—touching the fragment → bridges rise → time ricochets → final step. No orientation debt; who/where/when taught early and payoff justifies initial disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but actuator: roots curl like fingers around the fragment, bark spirals in “golden logarithms,” constraining the final step. Micro-objects (photos, halo, lantern) evolve state—curl, pulse, spill downward—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is crystal: middle span thickens, distance doubles behind, water opens pupil-wise. Sensory hierarchy follows POV bias—drum-pulse heard first, color bleaching noticed last—so detail never feels touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—tightens through each sensory accumulation rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: photographs fade faster yet scenes grow louder, narrowing options to either retreat or dissolve. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: loss of singular self. No causal antagonist, but coherent Accumulative pressure obviates need for one. Could use one earlier tactical loss (a dropped tool, a missed path) to sharpen stakes, but still lands above threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated returns to trace/erase: footprints stored, photos bleaching, halo recompleting. No explicit thesis; final image of downward light that refuses reflection reweights “texture” as diffusion rather than capture. Ambiguity lingers—dissolution may be transcendence or extinction—yet arises from concrete particulars, not assertion. Resists moralizing; insight is experiential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: selective attention to sap-prints, fever-warm metal, dragonfly punctuation. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses during hyperbolic stretch, then single-word sentences (“Light spills downward, not up”) at crescendo. No head-hopping; fragment elisions (“time here has never moved only forward”) are pattern-taught and paid off. Diction stays within believable lexicon even at heightened moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; sentence openings rotate between participle, noun-phrase, and verb-first. Mixed metaphors are intentionally dream-logic but internally coherent (“water refuses reflection and instead opens like a pupil”). One paraphrase loop (“quaking reverie” used twice in closing paragraph) but the reverb feels ceremonial rather than sloppy. High information density—each sentence layers sensory, temporal, and symbolic work—without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses hedge-maze trope with living vascular bridges and anti-reflective water, yielding a non-obvious angle on time-memory. Hyperbolic geometry is not gimmick but operational: corridor distance doubles, forcing physical stakes onto abstract concept. Risk-taking—dissolution as earned ending—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity of sap shoe-prints and downward-spilling light makes the splice of botany and chronology feel inevitable, not grafted.</comment>
