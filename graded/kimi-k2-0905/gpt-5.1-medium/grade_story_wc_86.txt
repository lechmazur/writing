<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is granular and embodied—guilt hot-wired to the brass pull, pulse-counting every limping step. The brother reveal lands as a credible extension of earlier self-recrimination rather than contrived twist. Renunciation is earned: the same hyper-attentive trait that once misread a treaty now forces him to read the moral ledger correctly. Only micro-slip: “slow form of drowning” drifts toward diagnostic cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the untethered lantern carries conceptual repricing—he cuts literal light to signal he will not trade justice for blood. Causal chain holds: because he once chose blood (father died), therefore he now chooses the spy, the drawer-pull question finally answered. Lens is causal throughout; each beat tightens options until only one ethical corridor remains. Mist, moon, and parapet stay spatially coherent; orientation anchor (“storm-worn parapet”) appears by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment> parapet granite, torch-smoke tang, and rope fibers under thumbnails all filter through the negotiator’s professional habit of cataloguing. Setting constrains choreography: the narrow walkway forces two-for-two limping exchanges and keeps archers at bay. The antique pull acts as micro-setting—its oval edge literally scores his palm while deciding. Only gap: we get no auditory difference between beetle-shell armor and gray cloaks in wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes compress from collective (return all sailors) to singular (brother vs spy); the tightening is irreversible once the hood lifts. Escalation is causal: because the captains hate the spy, offering her becomes a moral crucible that narrows the negotiator’s identity to one choice. Cost is legible—his brother’s gaze “asking the moon to hurry” is the unpaid price. No coincidence; every pressure is engineered by prior treaties and his own past treachery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recycled metaphor of opening/refusal: drawer pull, moon-covers, untethered lamp all reprice “opening” as ethical injury, not liberation. Subtext lives in gesture—the brother’s stare at the moon lets the sky, not the speaker, deliver the verdict. No thesis states; the final image reframes prior moons as witnesses that will not forgive. Ambiguity lingers: was wisdom purchased or merely another wound?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person texture is obsessive, syntactically wound tight—strings of parenthetical clauses mimic a mind turning every angle twice. Percussive anaphora (“To the east… To the west…”) mirrors tactical triage. Diction stays inside the POV’s diplomatic register yet cracks under stress: “strangled in its cradle” is savage for a negotiator. No head-hops; even the brother’s gaze is reported, not inhabited.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm climbs in clenched cadences toward the lantern release, then fractures into two short sentences that let the silence in. Mixed metaphors are grounded (“mist crawled like a low animal”) and physically coherent. One scaffold echo—“between apology and forgiveness” repeated—earns its keep by becoming the moral fulcrum. No filler stacks; every clause adds sensory or tactical data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar war-at-night tropes by forcing the neutral ground itself to speak (“this stone listens”). Moon-phase treaty timer is a novel social technology that feels ancient. The drawer-pull totem reverses the usual “keepsake = comfort” trope—it’s a question, not a charm. Risk: open-ended moral wound rather than heroic redemption; risk pays off because specificity anchors the abstraction.</comment>
