<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek’s contradictory drives—solace-seeking dive-recovery versus truth-telling that wounds listeners—press against each other in the single beat when he fingers the melted globe and lays the woman's lineage bare. His body registers the cost ("pressure in his chest") and his renunciation is visible: he keeps touching the object that proves both love and failure. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic, and the final micro-choice (handing the moral labor to the visitor) caps his arc with palpable fatigue. Only the sister-memory refrain drifts toward label-speak once, clipping the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the woman's tears freeze while the glacier creaks and candles flare, crystallizing the new ethical load she must carry. Causality holds throughout: the girl's dream-cameo propels the climb; Marek's wreck-archive authorizes the accusation; the visitor's ancestry converts abstract guilt into a present, payable debt. Cost is legible in the image of frozen droplets and the audible ice-shift under their feet. Drive lens is causal and uninterrupted; no orientation debt or late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ice shrine functions as micro-setting: walls funnel candlelight, the snow-bench forces intimate confession, and wax rivers glue the globe to the altar, literally binding past wreckage to present reckoning. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, flicker, and hush—mirroring the emotional narrowband of sleepless guilt. Glacier creaks timed at emotional spikes act as environmental dialogue. The melted dome is handled twice, its cloudy water re-appearing in the woman's frozen tears, a clean environmental echo that recharges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is exposure versus complicity, signaled in the first paragraph ("truths do not float...they need living hearts as their rafts") and tightened when Marek names the woman's forebears as the door-sealers. The single reversal: visitor arrives seeking solace, leaves shouldering restitution—occurs because Marek transfers the moral task to her, narrowing her options from passive sympathy to actionable reparations. Cost mounts through physical cues: wind-burn, sleepless eyes, audible glacier shift, and ultimately the frozen tear image. Agency is Marek's refusal to keep carrying the wreck alone; the visitor's agency crystallizes in the silent, teary acceptance that forecloses denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of inter-generational accountability emerges from concrete objects (globe, wax, inherited shipping manifests) rather than thesis statements. Subtext lives in gesture: the woman's hesitation at the "throat" of ice and her crystallizing tears wordlessly enact the moment ancestry becomes appetite. The ending's frozen starlight offers a non-moral image whose conceptual cost—restitution must replace legacy—reweights every prior candle-flare. No thematic echo lines; insight stays implicit, paid for by visceral cold and inherited shame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Marek's perceptual idiom: "windows fogged like breath on glass," "glacier settled onto his ribs." Syntax contracts under stress ("Tell me who visits you... try not to decide what it means"), then elongates when he opens dream-windows. No head-hop; woman's interior is read only through her trembling hands and frozen tears. Dialogue is sparse, each line goal-driven (accusation, plea, answer) and carries subtext of class-guilt. Rhythm modulates from incantatory openings to clipped deliveries at accusation, mirroring pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: single sentences braid sensory, emotional, and symbolic work ("Candles guttered...borrowed starlight"). No filter-verb clusters or loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay consistent within cold-light realm—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line lands on image that recharges borrowed starlight motif. Micro-movements (wax rivers freezing around globe) are purposeful, not puppetry. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally with paragraph-length variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost contact via strangers' dream cameos—flips standard séance trope into forensic psychology, then links it to corporate maritime crime, a synthesis not seen in familiar templates. Risk of lyrical obscurity is held by tight causal glue: every dream-cameo traces to a real manifest or wreck artifact. Melted snow globe transformed from kitsch keepsake to evidentiary relic, its glass-clouded water re-appearing in literal frozen tears, an inevitable reconfiguration. Specificity of glacier shrine as confession booth gives the ghost-whisperer trope fresh physical stakes; removal would collapse both atmosphere and metaphoric engine.</comment>
