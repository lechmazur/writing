<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Eren’s “persistent curiosity” is dramatized: it delays protocol, drives him to the apartment, and finally makes him phone Deniz. His interiority is concrete (“the hearing aid…ticked like a finger on his wrist”) and the final choice to phrase the message exactly as the pulses dictated shows a hierarchy of values with visible social cost—he risks breaching municipal rules to deliver a private absolution. The contradiction between bureaucratic duty and empathic trespass is held in scene, not summary. No stock therapeutic labels appear; the flaw complicates rather than solves the case.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: delivering the unsent sentence re-weights the city’s death-registry logic into a private moral act whose cost is Eren’s procedural breach and the audible fracture of Deniz’s composure. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the hearing aid twitches → Eren climbs → because he climbs → he finds the phone → because he listens → he must call. The “incidental heroism” reframes the entire bureaucratic frame without breaking it. No teleporting props; the photograph, the torn chain-lock, and the blinking voicemail all pay off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium and cabbage-scented stairwell are filtered through Eren’s attuned ear, turning acoustic detail into spatial texture. The hearing aid itself functions as micro-setting: its plastic crack and temperamental wheel constrain every dial-turn and timing choice. The photograph’s pier setting is re-inhabited in the final sentence, charging the closure with an off-page breeze that reweights the whole municipal archive. Weather is not backdrop but a muffled lung that forces the hush inside.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether a dead woman’s unsent forgiveness will reach the living—tightens once, when Eren chooses to phone Deniz instead of filing the standard tag. That single narrowing forfeits his bureaucratic safety and crystallizes the “incidental heroism” concept. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each pulse in the hearing aid adds density until the silence in the apartment becomes unbearable. Cost is legible: the guard’s future suspicion, the protocol breach, and the raw telephone cry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of the prompt’s phrase: the city’s official “contact tracing” is revealed as avoidance of true contact; only by stepping outside the system does Eren complete the real circuit of human recognition. Subtext lives in gesture—the torn chain lock, mismatched coat buttons, the phone icons “trembling like wet leaves.” No moral is stated; the final image of Deniz’s paper-thin cry is the answer. The story trusts the reader to feel that statistics dissolve but absolution does not.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that stays inside Eren’s perceptual signature: “the city forgets how to breathe,” “gravity shifted toward that frozen laughter.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“the line went quiet”—then widens for the telephone aftermath. No head-hopping; the single POV holds. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated; diction stays within a municipal night-worker’s plausible lexicon yet lifts into metaphor without strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe from one-beat staccato to longer liquid sentences that mirror the hush. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are precise—“underwater lanterns,” “tracing-paper cry”—and consistent with the acoustic/water imagery seeded early. Opening and final lines are anchor and echo, the latter recharging “quiet” with earned moral cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” premise is a fresh inversion of pandemic-era tracing: rather than preventing contagion, it spreads private absolution. The decades-old hearing aid as oracle and the municipal morgue’s acoustic archive feel inevitable yet surprising. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no overt antagonist—but coherence remains. The synthesis of bureaucratic noir with ghost-whisper tech creates a singular urban myth that would fail if any gadget or rule were swapped.</comment>
