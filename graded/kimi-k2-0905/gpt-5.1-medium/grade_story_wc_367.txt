<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin’s contradictory mix of fatalism and defiant creation is alive in every micro-choice—tending a pointless light, tasting static, laughing with “shadowed elation.” The final acquiescence to steer the beam upward is earned by decades of hoarded oaths fermenting in the walls, paid with the recognition that his own handwriting now dictates cosmic script. Interiority stays concrete and lighthouse-specific; no diagnostic self-talk. The only bar to 9.0 is absence of a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but within single-POV default this is maximal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: hum → recognition of stored promise → decision to tilt beam. The lighthouse’s stored reflection literally refracts his past letter into present command; closure is the decisive physical act of aiming dawn-shadows upward, cost legible in the weight of “hoarded shadows” he must now launch. Orientation anchors (who=Orrin, where=emerald lighthouse, when=night print press died) land before 120 words and serve the final image. No teleporting props or soft resets; every optic rule is taught by action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse itself—emerald glass, layered server-farm lenses, total-internal-reflection physics—functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactic; Orrin can only “steer” because the architecture has already folded starlight into memory slabs. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through storm-herald priorities: taste of static, sideways starlight, the “cackle on the wind” he is known by. Weather and optics evolve causally with events; the hum changes refraction indices, not just mood. One hair under 9.0 only because open-ocean spatial markers are impressionistic rather than mapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether obsolete ritual can birth an unalgorithmic dawn—tightens once, when the beam straightens from nostalgic swirl to usable vertical cannon. Agency is Orrin’s: he physically tilts the lens, paying with the realization his own archived rage is now ammunition. Coincidence (stars realign) complicates but does not resolve; resolution comes from his yes to the invitation. Cost is the surrender of protective irony—he must release the “hoarded shadows” he clung to for decades.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of discarded media: print ink → data-spun oil → light → new dawn, arguing ritual outlives the world that birthed it without ever stating the thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: laughter that snags on a shard in the chest, starlight that “gathers weight like memory.” Final image reweights “ancient shadows” from nostalgic cargo to propellant, offering resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, only the crystallized stance that refusal to abandon obsolete tending can rewire the sky.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained weather-front of laughing nihilism and lyric optics; perceptual signature coins phrases like “data-spun oil,” “ghost-light,” “sky that never hung above this ocean.” Syntax swells and contracts with lens refraction, mirroring internal state. No POV leakage; unreliability (accidental prophecy) is revealed through dramatized hits. Register stays within storm-herald diction even at peak intensity; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from tidal cadence to clipped imperative; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density is high—“transparent coil grown from reclaimed silicon and sand” does world, object, and eco-critique in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent: starlight cannot “gather weight” in physics yet the image is earned by prior “folded” optics. No figurative muddle in closure beat; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses dying print culture with antique optics to generate a literal beam of obsolete futures—synthesis feels inevitable only after reading. Trope of lighthouse keeper is inverted: the tower keeps him, fermenting his unmailed vow into fuel. Risk of cosmic steering is taken without retreat; conceptual integrity commits to launching “hoarded shadows” into satellite-blank sky. Specificity of “data-spun oil” and server-farm lenses makes the concept un-portable; swap any part and the engine fails.</comment>
