<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but the healing “witnessed” in the last line is asserted, not dramatized; no micro-choice or visible cost on the page makes the change legible. Aria’s status as listener-counselor is sketched only through soft dialogue, so the relationship crucible never pressures a decision. The dream chronicler identity drives the setup yet fades once the mapping starts—no contradiction shown between paid job and private obsession under pressure. Earned stasis is implied but not anchored in a renunciation or forfeiture we can point to.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of star-matches thickens meaning until the final ledger image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the telescope array becomes a mirror of communal grief—cost felt in the phrase “so you would not have to carry it alone.” Orientation clean by word 120; no causal breaks. The telegram’s date-stamp anomaly is set up but never exploited as a causal constraint; it’s texture, not turn, so escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dome lamps dimmed to “midnight solace” and the shawl-colored observatory walls act as micro-setting that mirrors interior shift. Transparent star chart physically overlays dream symbols—tool-as-setting that constrains the final match. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: daylily scent and train smoke cue time-slip before logic debates it. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, telescope, paper, and sky stay tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode or lose funding”—is declared early but never tested on-page; no clock, no bureaucratic veto looms. Escalation is purely cognitive: each star-match adds moral weight, not tactical jeopardy. Protagonist’s agency limited to tracing and murmuring; no decision forecloses an option. Cost is collective-historical, not personal, so pressure stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges via star-ledger equivalency, never sermonized. Final reconfiguration—“we carried this so you would not have to carry it alone”—reweights prior disasters from fate to communal choice. Ambiguity lingers: is the mapping healing or merely explanatory? No moral is forced; resonance is imagistic. Telegram and daylily act as quiet counter-images of trans-historic empathy rather than symbols harvested for points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a stargazer’s diction—“cartography of nightmares,” “breathing written in light”—consistent and specific. Compression taught early (“clocks surrendered to midnight”) and paid off in final cadence. No head-hopping; Aria’s interior is inferred only through gesture and soft rasp, maintaining distance. Dialogue indirection works: “Then let us not fail” carries budget stakes and coffee warmth in one breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to短的, telescopic fragments under pressure. No scaffold or synonym loops; “shared burdens” rephrased only once with purposeful shift. Metaphors stay physically coherent—sky as black page, brightness as breathing. Minor over-writing in “vast black page waiting for someone to write on it” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing dream-cartography with variable-star astronomy feels fresh and specific. Telegram predating itself by fifty years is a risk that stays ornamental rather than transformative—no rule-change payoff. Temple-as-ledger is a clever re-cast of apocalypse archives. Voice-level risks—lyric elision, celestial metaphors—pay off without clarity loss.</comment>
