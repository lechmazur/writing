<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic’s doubt and glow are credibly embodied; the final tacit assent to “help us remember how to let go” is foreshadowed by the ring-melt and taste-shifts, so renunciation lands with cost. Interior contradiction remains more asserted than dramatized in-scene; the narrator never actively resists the strangers’ offer, muting the crucible intensity demanded at 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (aurora, taste-notes, weather-coats) thickens until the closing tableau reweights the stake—archiving seasons inside bodies. The ring’s melt-into-vein supplies a visible, irreversible price, satisfying the closure-gate; causality is lyric, not mechanical, yet coherent. Orientation is taught early through aurora-brush and voting trees; no ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, spiraling grass, weather-cloth coats, and a sea mimicking sky are vividly selective; the tin compass-turned-metallic vein serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Every descriptor funnels attention toward the convergence ritual; place is not just backdrop but gravitational. Meets 9+ gate: the compass-vein constrains the closing assent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator join the archive or remain detached—tightens as tastes shift from rust to burnt sugar, culminating in the ring’s fusion and tacit yes; cost is the loss of skeptical distance. Escalation is textural: density of sensory input, not external blockage; under Accumulative lens this counts. Could use one sharper obstacle or forfeiture to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the burden of remembering climate loss is literally borne by bodies; no moralizing line states this. Final image—four small bodies under fading aurora—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about shared stewardship. Subtext in taste and weather-coats avoids abstraction; complexity lingers without tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lyric, scientifically tinged diction that matches the POV’s skepticism; perceptual signature shows in synesthetic taste-navigation. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at ring-melt, longer breaths during exposition. No dialogue to fault; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: most sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work; rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Occasional stacked modifiers (“slow, luminous lines”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. Zero loops, no scaffold; grammar clean, metaphors internally consistent. Closure beat unmarred by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The climate-archive premise, taste-based navigation, and auroral election of trees synthesize into a specific, non-oblique vision. Risk in lyric structure is rewarded because pressure and closure remain legible. Without these exact images the emotional calculus collapses; freshness feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
