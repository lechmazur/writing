<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—"fog with teeth," "jaded wonder"—but the narrator’s contradictory impulses stay mostly reflective; no micro-choice in-scene forces a costly trade-off. The final hover above the graves is a stance crystallization rather than a decision, so the earned-cost bar for 8.8+ isn’t cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the premise of self-haunting until the final image reweights time as "pack of stray dogs." Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"I am here alone…still cannot look away"—but the middle ellipsis between cabin and flight is a mild causality gap; a smoother transition would tighten linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and glowing crosses are sharply sensed and filter through the ranger’s professional eye; the graveyard reprise supplies the final image. Thin air and resin scent constrain action—he must fly to breathe/escape—meeting the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on tactics; only the instant shift from bunk to sky keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve narrative coherence against proliferating selves—tightens when the blank scroll forces the night walk; soaring becomes the last viable tactic. One meaningful deepening (realizing past selves "stalk" him) narrows options; cost is the perpetual chronicler role, but the price is more stated than viscerally felt on this beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—time as feral pack, narrative as failed containment—emerges through recurrent graves and envy of cleaner stories, never sermonized. Final "weary awe" reconfigures earlier wonder as compulsion; ambiguity lingers without confusion. A hairline slip: "jaded wonder" is named twice, slightly diluting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is unmistakable: compressed syntax, ranger argot, metaphoric leaps ("stars close enough to touch"). Rhythm accelerates into breathless flight, mirroring thin-air panic; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature holds from frozen-lightning beams to dashboard graves, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences dual-load atmosphere and exposition. Figurative layering is high but patterned early ("frozen lightning," "feral nostalgia") so it reads as voice, not clutter. One scaffold echo—"I call it…" / "I am here alone…"—mildly loops; otherwise zero paraphrase cycles or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a lucid-dream cartographer who mines his own deaths feels fresh; birch-scroll maps from never-grown trees crystallize the concept. Tropes (doppelgänger, time slips) are retooled through ranger logistics and bureaucratic afterlife admin. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final Charged Poise, making the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
