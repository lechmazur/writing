<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound in a world that forbids it—drives every beat; his embodied tremor when the grove sways shows cost without label-speak. The micro-choice to strum copper rather than preserve bark crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Ina’s scarred palms and silent rebuke supply secondary pressure that alters his tempo. Earned stasis lands: the music will never reach ears, yet he accepts the perpetual ache inside his ribs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove’s shared pulse reconfigures meaning—silence is no longer absence but a new medium—cost is the unending labor of sustaining motion. Causal linkage holds: fracture map → copper wire → communal sway. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact at final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (palms on bark, feet in leaf litter) constrains the strum angle and charges the final shared tremor. Porcelain insulator returns as micro-setting that governs wire tension. Sensory economy—mushroom tilt, hedgehog pause—mirrors internal state without catalogue. Spatial choreography across two bodies and seven trees remains seamless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Dominant stake—prove music can exist without sound—tightens when the first silent chord either binds the grove or exposes Lio to ridicule. Escalation is accumulative: each responsive sway increases density until refusal becomes impossible. Cost is visible: Lio’s exhaustion and the perpetual obligation to keep the grove moving. The final image forecloses rest—he must stay attuned forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from tactile particulars: music = shared motion, silence = communal empathy. Subtext in Ina’s eyebrow and the hedgehog’s pause avoids thesis statement. Final reweighting—fractures become scores—offers non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the ache of perpetual motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Lio’s perceptual filter: “light tiptoes on its toes” is his synesthetic stance. Syntax lengthens and contracts with wind rhythm; diction rooted in arboreal craft. No head-hopping; Ina’s interior accessed only through gesture and Lio’s interpretation—legible under Hybrid lens. Filter verbs (“he senses”) are voice-motivated, not clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative muddle absent in peak beats. Sentence variety accelerates during strum, slows into final exhausted hush. High density: one sentence packs wire, bark, and social risk. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge the empathy-in-motion motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent music made from communal sway—is non-obvious yet inevitable after first paragraph. Fracture-analysis as score-finding transforms forensic trope into poetic epistemology. Risk of preciousness averted by grounded copper scrap and scarred palms. Final reconfiguration feels freshly minted yet tightly earned.</comment>
