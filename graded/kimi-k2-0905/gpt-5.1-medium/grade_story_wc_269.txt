<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s tapping habit is vividly embodied and links past trauma to present vigilance; the decision to withhold the atlas page from colleagues shows a contradictory impulse between scientific duty and private obsession. The interior voice is specific—"swallowed stone," "inner register that counted dying corals"—but the arc remains observational rather than choice-driven, so the final nod-of-the-ocean moment feels atmospheric more than personally costly. Still, the flaws are nuanced and the characterization sustains atmosphere; no stock phrasing or competence-padding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s patterned tapping syncs with an anomalous swell that momentarily reveals a vanished sandbar, re-weighting the premise that oceanic paths can be summoned or forgotten. Cost is felt in the "drifting moored" final image—station and watcher both suspended over an unprinted map. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: repeated sensory beats (tapping, flicker, salt-hardened paper) accumulate until the rhythm itself rewrites the tide. One mild orientation wobble: “we” appears once before group membership is named, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<comment>Compressed lyric detail—"tide draw slow scars," "quiet than the reefs ever were"—renders the drowned city and steel station as extensions of lung and skeleton. The atlas page functions as micro-setting/object: its obsolete contour lines physically overlay the transparent tide table, guiding the narrator’s tapping and bending the perceived geography. Salt-hardened edges, jellyfish simile, and flashlight beam make the paper a living prop that constrains attention and later charges the apparition of the sandbar. Environment and tool are inseparable from perception; no static catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—why oceanic paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when data "slips sideways" and the atlas page contradicts bathymetry. The narrator’s agency is attentional: by drumming the obsolete lanes, they provoke an off-beat swell that momentarily re-materializes a erased sandbar, narrowing future certainty. Cost is atmospheric but legible—the station nods, horizon bends, leaving the narrator "drifting moored," options reconfigured. One meaningful intensification satisfies short-form requirement under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of personal rhythm (tapping) and planetary rhythm (tides): memory can physically summon lost geographies, but the cost is unending vigilance. Subtext resides in the penciled note—"they vanish where the rhythm breaks"—which reframes ecological grief as a percussion sequence we forgot to keep. No moralizing; final image reweights premise without thesis. The insight feels earned because it grows from the narrator’s coral-counting past and salt-scarred present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a scientist’s compressed precision—"isostatic rebound," "bathymetric reason"—yet bleeds into elegiac cadence via assonance and fragmentary syntax. Perceptual signature is stark: color-drained corals, salt-hardened paper, flashlight beam on blurred inks. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress ("I moved my hand when the arrows turned"). Dialogue is minimal but distinct—Rafi’s mouth pulling sideways, Lian’s skeptical eyes—anchoring the collective without voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence couples sensory concrete with conceptual stakes—"autonomous buoys lose their own trajectories, drifting off planned loops as if the water has forgotten how to carry them." Metaphors are co-extensive ("station hums like a tired lung") yet internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations mirrored by single-line staccato beats. Minor paraphrase loop—"quiet than the reefs ever were...quiet now"—but forgivable at lyric pressure peak and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of climate-science diction with percussive mysticism yields a fresh angle on sea-level rise: the ocean itself can forget its choreography. Atlas page as mnemonic talisman transforms familiar eco-parable into ontological mystery. Risk in second-person address ("you") is avoided; stakes stay personal. Specificity of "sixty meters of water for fifteen years" roots the surreal in verifiable datum. The concept feels inevitable rather than clever—rhythm as cartography—meeting the transformation test.</comment>
