<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—her remembered grief and her live-duty tenderness—co-exist in-scene: guitar notes descend to reassure Mr. Alvarez while she internally flinches from the baby-curl memory. Every micro-choice (tuning before sunrise, refusing to drown the sky, letting the chord die) is driven by the “ordinary magic” credo until the eclipse itself re-prices that credo, turning memory from lance to opening. No stock therapy-speak; body cues (“grip the guitar neck,” “exhale”) carry cost. The cap is 8.9 rather than 9+ because the daughter’s death is named only via object, never given prior causal footprint that would make the final reweighting fully inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory pattern (sage scent, light ladders, eclipse dusk) thickens until the hush re-configures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30; causality is atmospheric tightening, not event-chain. Closure is a Charged Poise—the ring-of-fire image conceptually reweights “ordinary magic” and grief in one visible cost. No loops, no ambiguity, no props teleport; the keepsake returns metaphorically in the final image, satisfying the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (courtyard ash tree, flagstones, eclipse light) directly constrains the action: music must stay low, bodies must stay still, eyes must use cardboard viewers. The “baby hair curl” functions as micro-setting in the drawer, charging the final sky-image when its color swirls into the eclipse. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s musician bias—sound and light dominate, smell of sage threads throughout. Specificity is irreplaceable: remove Sage Ridge slope or the tree and the communal hush collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s need to re-home her own wonder without being consumed by grief—tightens when the sky literally darkens and the patients’ flinch/awe tests her credo. One meaningful deepening: the eclipse dusk converts the locked-drawer memory from private shard to shared cosmology, visible cost registered in her exhale and finger-grip. Agency is cumulative-textural (she stops playing, lets silence rule) rather than a plotted reversal. Loses 0.3 because Lake’s detox arc and Mr. Alvarez stroke remain secondary accents that do not feed back into Mara’s pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: no one states “ordinary magic” aloud; instead, the curl, the cardboard viewers, and the ring of fire triangulate it. Final image performs Conceptual Repricing—grief becomes porous to wonder without moral tag. Subtext in gesture: Lake’s hand-grab is a silent covenant that rehab can still contain awe. No sermon, no tidy moral; resonance lingers in the reader’s retina after the last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><<comment>Third-person tight stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual filter: “guitar neck” feels cold, “sage brushed the windows” is musician synesthesia. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of clauses until the final minute of silence. No head-hopping; Mr. Alvarez’s interior is reached only through his visible half-smile and tap code. Diction stays within a working therapist’s lexicon; only “tonic” risks mild elevation but is justified by profession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer scent, light, and social choreography. Metaphors are sparse, never mixed; “oxygen tubing like a halo” is precise, one-and-done. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold repetition. Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences swell toward totality, then fragmentary utterances during hush. Copy-clean; pronoun tracking flawless even with seven patients in motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar rehab + eclipse combo is re-freshened through therapist-as-shaman angle and “ordinary magic” thesis. Risk taken: climax is collective stillness rather than a plotted coup, yet silence feels earned by prior musical cues. Specificity of the baby-curl color re-entering the sky ring is non-obvious and memorable. Loses 0.4 because detox-girl hand-hold edges toward sentimental trope without subverting it.</comment>
