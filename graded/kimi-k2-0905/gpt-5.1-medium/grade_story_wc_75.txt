<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulse—cataloguing vs. rescue—surfaces early and recurs, but the final renunciation (“I stayed after my contract ended”) is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the interiority is textured yet the decisive beat is summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the narrator’s choice to stay reconfigures options under an Accumulative/Textural lens, charged by the emerald lens image and the bread-letter ritual; cost is felt in the phrase “which of us history would spare.” Causality holds; one minor orientation lag (who/where fully anchored ~140 words) is waived because mist-delay pays off atmospherically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Waterfall mist, yeast-stone scent, and lantern terraces are filtered through the narrator’s archivist gaze; the emerald opera glass acts as micro-setting that re-weights the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across spiral stair and kitchen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve intangible culture—tightens when the lens reveals ghost crafts; the bread-initial custom supplies one visible cost (displaced eat only the taste of their names). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges through bread, lens, and bees’ absence; no explicit thesis stated. Final image (“wondering which of us history would spare”) re-weights prior motifs with conceptual cost, meeting CR standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries consistent archivist precision—“vocabulary of a footnote,” “rotting velvet seats”—without register drift. Compression (“roar softened into a constant breath”) teaches lyric pattern early; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual when Lira commands “Then look at us with it.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long atmospheric clauses to short declaratives at pressure points; no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor (“world that had already decided to vanish”) is minor; information density high, every sentence advances stakes or texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Refugee camp inside a museum inside a waterfall is fresh; bread-initial ritual and emerald opera glass as memory prosthesis transform familiar displacement trope into specific cultural technology. Risk-taking (lyric accretion over plot reversals) heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
