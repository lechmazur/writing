<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s curiosity is concrete—he pockets vials, kneels to leave his own print, chooses not to lie—each micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values (heritage vs. duty) with visible cost. The amber flash promised to his daughter externalizes internal stakes, making the emotional price legible. The red vial’s untouched chill in the final line is Earned Stasis: refusal forecloses retreat, sealing cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (iceberg summit, submerged-city lights, pulsar beacon) tightens the same stake—loss of the last untouched grain—until the amber glow reweights it into beauty remembered. Closure is Charged Poise: options (lie, delay, surrender) are crystallized in the final red-vial silence, cost felt. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: “dawning hush” is named more than enacted, but the amber bloom pays the pattern off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: its glassy basalt pan and knife-edged shadows literally guide where Ilya can kneel and press his glove. The “submerged city” of dormant harvesters mirrors the buried grain, charging the final image when both face obliteration. Basalt shard serves as tool-stage for the amber reaction, tying environment to closure. Light horizon seam constrains camera frame, making sunrise a countdown device.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—last grain’s erasure—tightens once: heritage shutdown timer drops from 20 min to amber ignition. Protagonist agency: refusal to declare instability costs him any further orbit of reprieve; amber flash is proactive creation of beauty under duress. Cost is legible—his own print beside history’s is irreversible once harvesters wake. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and necessity, crystallized in the amber glow that transmutes dust into memory. No moralizing; the final red-vial silence invites multiple readings—complicity, acceptance, futile witness. Recurring “hourglass” reweights: first as guardian, finally as spent sand. Insight is earned through the tactile act of pressing glove to regolith, not stated.</comment>

<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp: Ilya notices seals, stress gauges, horizon color as a professional inspector yet filters them through paternal tenderness. Syntax breathes with long accumulative clauses that mirror dust settling. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly limited to what an astronaut can know. Final red-vial coldness is rhythmic halt, mirroring emotional cutoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>High information density: “floodlights from the waiting harvesters glimmered like a submerged city” does sensorial triple duty—visual, emotional, thematic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (iceberg, hourglass, beacon) without cluttering peak beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by image (untouched red vial) that recharges earlier vial motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar heritage law + forensic parenting via chemistry. The amber-glow postcard to a child reconfigures typical “last man on moon” elegy into intimate engineering. Risk—quiet ending with no overt rebellion—pays off because refusal bears undeniable cost. Grain as nightwatch sentinel feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
