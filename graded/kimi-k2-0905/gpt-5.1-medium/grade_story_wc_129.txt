<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—solitary artist vs. hunger for community—are dramatized in the moment he touches the obsidian and feels “the orchard’s slow heartbeat.” The final micro-choice to invite strangers into a shared weave is earned by this tactile beat and carries visible cost: he surrenders sole authorship. Interiority stays concrete (“hands permanently greened,” “luminescent ache”) without diagnostic speak. secondary characters apply only light pressure; Mira functions more as echo than crucible, capping the score just below elite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Stay and scatter” reweights the premise, making the web-sculpture inevitable. The causal lens holds—three-day stay rule → find tag → co-create—though escalation is gentle, a single deepening rather than successive turns. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 15). Cost is felt in the final image (“small colors claiming space”) but not yet paid on-page; the slight softness keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not backdrop but tactical: the arbor’s facets literally swallow starlight, forcing the protagonists to squint, lean, discover grooves. Micro-setting (Mira’s chalk lines, Elian’s sap-green palms) constrains movement and dictates kneeling/standing positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Elian notices reed-like gleams, not tourist vistas. The environment evolves: orchard “folds into stillness,” signaling time for shared voices; this final charge lifts it above 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—signals early (“graft himself onto community”). Escalation is accumulative: each spiral walk tightens the possibility of solitary art out, collective art in. The arbor discovery is the single meaningful intensifier, foreclosing the option to keep searching alone. Cost is conceptual (shared authorship) rather than visceral; that softness keeps it shy of 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of graffiti’s ephemerality into crystal’s permanence: “stay and scatter” reframes kinship as both root and rumor. No explicit thesis; the final image of voices braiding beneath night air supplies the non-literal answer. Recurring “webs” shift from metaphor to material without sentimentalism. The ache stays luminescent, unresolved—复杂性 lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elian’s reed-tuned perception: “gaze boldly sympathetic” is shown when he kneels to avoid erasing chalk lines. Syntax mirrors his sculptor patience—long velvety sentences that suddenly notch tight at discovery (“There, she whispered”). No head-hop; Mira’s interior is inferred only through Elian’swatch of her covering her mouth. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is justified by Elian’sart-world lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “trees sprouted from echoes” carries world-rule, metaphor, and mood in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or social information. Figurative language peaks at the arbor but remains coherent—night-breath, drumlines—without muddling causality. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Premise fuses eco-fantasy with street-art philosophy; the crystal/pear/orchard combo feels fresh yet inevitable. “Stay and scatter” is a non-obvious synthesis of graffiti’s throw-up and orchard’s perennial growth. Risk—lyric ellipsis, no antagonist—pays off in Charged Poise. The transformation test passes: swap setting or medium and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Setup: “marsh-reed sculptor” in line 4. Development: his tactile habit of avoiding chalk lines mirrors reed-care; chooses collaborative weave over solo reed hut. Closure: invites strangers to weave fragments—decision impossible without prior reed craft. Cost: surrenders solitary authorship. Specificity high—reeds = fragility yet connectivity.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Obsidian arbor appears at 70% but instantly reweights all prior searching; grooves catch dust, making tag legible. Physical properties—swallowing starlight—force characters to squat, touch, decide. Final sculpture will hang beneath it, transferring the arbor’s charge to the community piece. Irreplaceable; no other object could archive light and intention this way.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Webs of kinship start as rumor, become literal plan: “weave in a fragment…until the sculpture held more lives than he could name.” Middle beat: Mira’s maps useless, reoriented to shared web. Closure: their voices rise like tender graffiti—web now audible. Concept drives tactics; without it, Elian would carve a solitary statue.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>“Boldly sympathetic” is shown when he kneels to save Mira’s chalk, catches others’ fractures “without pity.” Constrains action: he listens instead of advising, inviting collaboration. Cost: absorbs others’ pain without outlet, leading to need for communal release. Trait is not label-only; it governs micro-choices.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Dedicate appears late (line 87) but redefines prior material: solitary reed craft → communal lattice. Action is dramatized: “He would invite anyone…until the sculpture held more lives…” Without this dedication, closure image of shared voices cannot exist. Swappable verb would blunt causal linkage; “dedicate” carries artistic solemnity.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Shared search mechanics structure middle 60% of story; each spiral tightens stakes. Search teaches them to read light-as-ink, leading to arbor. Tag’s ellipsis (“Stay and scatter”) is the pivot that converts search into collaboration. Mechanics matter: without looking for subtle light-distortions, they would never find the imperative to stay.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Crystalline orchard is not scenery: its three-night rule sets the clock, its glass leaves listen, its obsidian arbor supplies the only surface that can hold Siltghost’s tag. Spatial choreography clear—tourists drift away, orchard “folds into stillness,” making private collaboration possible. Setting pressures choice: only here can echoes root.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>“Beyond the murmur of lost languages” is atmospheric frame rather than live clock; no ticking countdown. Yet it primes theme: languages lost = kinship forgotten, reversed by new dialect “one syllable at a time.” Functions as conceptual backdrop, not tactical timer. Mid-band justified.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Motivation declared line 8: “come to the orchard to graft himself onto community.” Friction dramatized: solitary ditches vs. shared weaving. Final micro-choice—invite strangers—pays cost of authorship. Without this desire, no story engine; tag would remain mere curiosity.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Luminescent ache is not static mood; it modulates: wonder at crystal pears → urgency of search → tender ache at “Stay and scatter” → quiet uplift of shared voices. Final image of “small colors claiming space” embodies ache turned hopeful glow. Tone charges closure, inseparable from emotional payoff.</question>
