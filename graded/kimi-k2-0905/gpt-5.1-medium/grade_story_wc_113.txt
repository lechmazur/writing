<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The musician’s trespass-for-music motive stays vivid; his embodied humming of the blot-notes shows a micro-choice that risks discovery. Yet the interior contradiction—why stay once the water threatens his instrument?—isn’t dramatized; the bow at the end feels symbolic, not costly. Still, the single-POV interiority is atmospheric and consistent, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: he accepts the ghost-score with visible cost—his bass above dark water, rebellion now shared. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each water-warped page intensifies the mutiny motif until the final image reweights silence itself. Orientation is swift; the closed opera house and rising flood are anchored by line 3. Causality is thin—why tonight?—but the pattern coherence overrides that gap at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Flooded pit, chandeliers clinking like distant chimes, sagging program—the sensory triad is selective and pressures choice: the flood literally prevents normal playing, forcing the new score. The body-as-setting micro-turn (instrument held above water) constrains the final gesture. No spatial drift; water level tracked implicitly through ankle→surface→drop echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s musical treason—tightens as each smudged staff line forecloses standard performance; the unresolved chord pattern is the visible price. One meaningful deepening: the realization that silence itself is part of the score. No secondary reversal, but the lens-consistent accumulation suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art as subversion persists even after state and structure drown. The opera-as-sunken-cathedral image reconfigures the meaning of “performance” without sermon. The final bow is a non-literal answer—acceptance of mutiny through silence—whose cost is felt in the freezing water and the unstruck chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate POV retains consistent perceptual signature—musician hears intervals in drips, sees notation in stains. No head-hopping; lyric compressions (“wordless conversation”) are taught early and pay off in final acceptance. Syntax mimics score rhythm: cascading clauses for rising water, clipped fragments for isolated notes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: “paper sagging, ink already bleeding into shapeless clouds” does triple work—sets, stakes, symbol. Figurative language is patterned (water-as-riptide, chandeliers-as-chimes) and never muddled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “like distant, uneasy chimes” and “like a pale, swollen leaf” are both simile clusters within 20 lines, but they serve distinct sensory slots, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: political dissent encoded in water-damaged notation is new; ghost-story and drowned-opera tropes interlock through the concrete program prop. Risk—lyric stillness at climax—pays off because the silence is the rebellion. Without this exact flood-warped score the mutiny motif collapses, meeting irreplaceability test.</comment>
