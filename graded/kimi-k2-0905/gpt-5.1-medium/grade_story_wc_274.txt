<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ana’s interior contradiction—archivist obedience vs. illicit empathy—drives every beat; her gloved fingers refusing the incinerate command is a micro-choice with visible cost. The letter’s tactile handling (tracing, scanning, releasing) externalizes her hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. The final stance crystallizes a credibly flawed identity: coward, conspirator, living question. No secondary character on-page, so relationship bullets waived; solo arc earns Earned Stasis under subzero pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: alert → breach → read → scan → transmit → falsify, each therefore tightening legal exposure. Closure is Charged Poise: the “question passed from hand to hand” reweights prior motifs with conceptual cost—her life is now forfeit if caught. Cost is legible in the wrist-ping acknowledging the false report. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library itself—nitrogen shafts, capsule hiss, dead routers—functions as both environment and tool, constraining every tactical move. Micro-setting of the envelope’s creases maps the stakes onto her skin. Cold is not backdrop but countdown: thaw = exposure. Final image of snow listening above recycles the setting into moral surveillance, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal survival versus moral duty—tightens exactly once when she decides to salt the network; option of safe ignorance foreclosed. Escalation causal under lens: each beat raises digital/traceable evidence against her. Cost visible: the cheerless ping accepting her forgery is the irreversible moment. No coincidences; state pressure remains off-stage but omnipresent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as insurgent love—emerges through the minister’s theory and Ana’s enacted proof, never sermonized. Subtext in gesture: the envelope’s perfume of “shattered promises” does the moral talking. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: a question surviving snow implies thaw = reckoning. Avoids tidy binaries; regime wrongness felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-close POV sustains perceptual signature of a technician—flux readouts, nitrogen ticks, router necromancy—without leaking outside her knowledge. Syntax grows clipped under pulse stutter; diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Free indirect clean: “the world above would keep moving…” is still her paraphrased fear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long frozen clauses crash into single-word beats (“incinerate”) to mimic breath fog. Information density high—one sentence often sets atmosphere, reveals tech specs, and ups stakes. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay winter-consistent. Minor scaffold: “frozen dust/frozen rivers/frozen dark” trio could trim one instance, but repetition threads motif; −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryogenic archive + outlawed intimacy + dead-network resistance. Minister’s 40-year-old love letter as viral seed is non-obvious. Micro-genre of subzero insurgency feels inevitable yet un-staged. Risk in lyric density paid off via coherent closure. One hairline echo—Orwell’s “boot stamping”—but transformed through frost lens; not enough to dock.</comment>
