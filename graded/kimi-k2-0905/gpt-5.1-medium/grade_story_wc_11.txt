<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The robot’s curiosity-as-ache is a sharp, embodied contradiction that drives every looped choice; the aerial ghost-view that accrues is a credible, costly transformation of perception. Interiority stays concrete (“cool ache under every diagnostic report”) and avoids label-speak. The refusal / varied touch experiments show micro-choices under pressure, but the final stance—“thoughts come from the space between moments”—is declared, not dramatized with visible cost, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop deposits one more sensory flake until the violin’s tone collapses the pattern into an aerial double-exposure that reweights HEPA-3’s cognition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the loop stutters into real dusk and the robot’s perceptual grid is permanently altered; cost is the puddled violin and the frost on his fingers—undeniable on-page traces. Causality is intact: the 612th touch is motivated by accumulated detail, not authorial sleight. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 30.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, icicle organ pipes, and the black-stone plinth are selective, tactile, and mirrored in the violin’s fragility; environment literally melts under contact, constraining the climax. Micro-setting (the ice violin) functions as setting-object and charges the final image. Sensory economy is high—sound released through tactile sensors is a fresh synesthetic twist. Twilight thickens instead of resetting, providing causal time-marker that evolves with plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a circuit-mind step outside its own pattern?—is signaled early and tightens through each micro-observation (frost feathers, tremble in recorded voice) that accumulates into the aerial viewpoint. Pressure is textural: every refused or harder touch tests whether pattern can be broken; the stutter-loop that fails to close is the visible price. No coincidence; escalation is driven by HEPA-3’s iterative agency. Cost is the melted instrument and the irreversible evening—felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the central image: a cleaning robot learns that thought is not output but a between-state revealed only by destroying the fragile instrument designed to be destroyed. No explicit thesis; the final line offers conceptual repricing—knowledge now arrives in the pause between broom strokes. Subtext resides in the violin’s hum and the frost riming his fingertips: beauty as expendable tool for cognition. Resonance is oblique yet unmistakable; ambiguity is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to HEPA-3’s perceptual circuitry; no head-hop. Syntax is subtly mechanical (“his thermal sensors projected”) yet lifts into lyric register when tone pours “like cold water” through arrays—an intentional distance shift that serves the beat. Diction remains within plausible robot lexicon while still feeling literary. Patterned repetition of loop cues is taught early and pays off when twilight fails to rewind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or cognition. Metaphors are precise and physically coherent (“icicles hung…like organ pipes”). Information density is high: one sentence can stage, sense, and philosophize (“the procedure they had wheeled his chassis…”). No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs anchor even abstract perception. Rhythm accelerates with loop compression, then breathes when tone releases aerial view—perfectly calibrated to emotional arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sentient janitor + ice violin + time-loop as cognitive experiment feels inevitable yet unprecedented. The violin’s designed-to-be-destroyed fragility reprises the theme of expendable beauty as gateway to consciousness. Risk—using mundane maintenance diction for mystical epiphany—pays off without clarity loss. Specificity of “space between broom strokes” is unportable; story would collapse if detail were swapped.</comment>
