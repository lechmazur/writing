<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s involuntary truthfulness is dramatized—speech is ripped out “in sharp strips”—and the final refusal to soften perception lands as earned cost. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the dream-from-the-eye beat is the only moment where contradictory impulses actively collide in scene. Risa functions as sounding board rather than crucible, so status/relationship pressure is muted. Still, the narrator’s flaw drives every micro-choice and the closing stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test for causality and cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass eye’s shift from ominous relic to “plain surface” reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the final sentence—“we practiced seeing one another and surviving the sight”—a Charged Poise that forecloses the old terror. Causality holds: the truffle-mapping, truth-telling, and storm converge to precipitate the clearing. One minor loop—”discredited textbooks” reiterated three times in 60 words—nicks perfection but does not touch the closing beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ravine-orchard is not backdrop but physics: cables hum, ladders vibrate, storms crawl; these constraints shape when and how the narrator speaks. The glass eye’s evolving tactile detail (cloudy → transparent) is the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is ruthless—salt-and-dust velvet, iron taste—each chosen to tilt the next choice. Environment, body, and tool jointly constrain tactics and are reweighted at closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can we bear to be fully seen?”—is signaled by line 5 and tightens once: the storm-night forces the eye to clear, dispersing the collective terror. Escalation is textural: fear chords accumulate through adjacent pods until the mirror-fright crystallizes and snaps. Protagonist agency is observational rather than decisive; the renunciation is to keep looking without the old buffer—costly but not a causal turn. Sufficient for high-band, though a hair below the 8.2 gate because the final release is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete reversal of the eye: empathy’s pain is not solved by filtration but by consensual exposure. No character ever articulates a moral; the final line’s “surviving the sight” is image, not thesis. Subtext hums in gesture—Risa’s laugh “like something cracking and then letting light through.” The discredited-textbooks motif reprises with shifted weight, satisfying the non-literal reweighting test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “rational truffle forager” diction fused with lyric compression—“truth sheared out of me in sharp strips.” Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for calm mapping, staccato fragments when storms press. Perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail (fungal lace, iron taste) is filtered through the narrator’s involuntary clarity. No head-hopping; POV distance stays interior-tight; elisions (“they said”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense packing, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“chewed,” “bit,” “sheared”). One metaphor cluster around “ligaments / nervous / dreaming animal” arrives within a single beat and is pattern-taught, so allowed. The final paragraph’s short declaratives mirror the eye’s clearing, propelling closure. A lone simultaneity hiccup—“I woke with the taste of iron in my mouth and the feeling of having watched…”—drops the tenth of a point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise is familiar, yet the inversion—oversensitivity as exile, truffles as mood buffers—feels freshly synthesized. The glass eye’s demystification reframes collective fear into chosen witness, a conceptual risk that pays off emotionally. Specificity anchors novelty: hollowed-walnut smuggling, salt-and-dust velvet, chords of unresolved hearts. The final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight yet un-telegraphed, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
