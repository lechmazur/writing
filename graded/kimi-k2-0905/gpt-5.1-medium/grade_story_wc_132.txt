<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s need for control and her envy of the linden’s unthinking resilience are vividly embodied in her tactile routines and detours; the final collapse into the mud is an earned, visible cost. Interior contradiction—“circuitously sincere” rationalizations versus the shy orbit she cannot admit—drives every beat. The only bar to 9.0 is that the climactic surrender is narrated more than dramatized; we are told the green hush “pressed” rather than seeing a micro-choice that concretely releases control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lucid Conceptual Repricing: the linden leaf’s ember reweights the entire rule-set, making surrender legible as the new tactic. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each observed detail of plant adaptation tightens the pattern until the spiral burn inside her chest becomes the unavoidable image. Cost is unmistakable: “without her consent” and “knees gave” are on-page sentences where options narrow to mud and green hush. No slips touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that literally holds the linden leaf and becomes the altar where control is relinquished; its beads of water constrain her posture and cue the hallucinatory shimmer. Sensory economy is ruthless—only three anchored locales (nursery bench, road linden, trellis) yet each resurfaces with transformed stakes. The burned spiral trunk reappears inside her chest, charging the final image; without the trellis as physical pivot the surrender would lose spatial legibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintenance of order against unscheduled growth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: the linden’s survival after lightning embodies the threat that control may be futile. The final beat externalizes this tightening by forcing her body to the mud, foreclosing the option to keep watching from a safe remove. Cost is visible (soiled knees, stolen leaf, internal spiral) under the Accumulative lens; no further escalation is required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the concrete: plants that “reconstruct themselves by releasing control” reprice her life-rule of invoices and rows. No overt statement; the realization that “every hour… had been teaching her” is earned through stacked particulars rather than assertion. Final image of green hush and sap-thick whispers offers resonant non-literal answer—surrender is the new growth—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unassailably specific: “circuitously sincere detours,” “ghost of sky,” “confusion of scrub and oak where storms twisted the wind into knots.” Syntax mirrors the spiraling obsession—long, subordinated sentences that coil back on themselves. No head-hopping; distance remains tight to Mara’s professional gaze even as it fractures into vegetal hallucination. The elevated diction (“sap-thick whispers,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by her nursery owner’s precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is ferocious—single sentences deliver weather, parental absence, and occupational routine without slack. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph’s breathless anaphora (“roots curling… stems straightening… cracked pot…”) that propels the collapse. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; “thunder grumbled like a tired animal” is fresh yet apt. Only the faintest scaffold: “she told herself” appears twice, a micro-tic that keeps this just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—storm season nursery owner confronts a burned-yet-leafing linden as instruction in surrender—feels inevitable and non-obvious. Risk is taken in the lyric, almost animist climax where setting “turns to watch her,” yet the pattern is taught early by plant behavior observations. No stock trope of “character learns from nature” is left untransformed; the spiral burn internalized as cardiac scar is a fresh inflection that could not swap with any generic symbol.</comment>
