<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The potter’s interiority is rich and embodied—micro-choices (pinch of clay-seed, hand-hover over hive) betray his quiet, obsessive compassion. The causal chain from swatting-scout = salt-death to water-dish = bloom is slim but legible; the “sharp gentleness” toward his own past cruelty crystallizes a credible internal arc with felt cost. No contradictory impulses play out in live scene, only layered observation, so the 9+ quick test isn’t fully met. Still, the character reads as an individual, not a type, and his final stance of unguaranteed stewardship lands as earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the timeline rule-set is rewired—kindness becomes an almost-physical force that can tilt history. Cost is visible in the final image: cooled porcelain fragility inside him, sprouts leaning toward his touch, persistent wasteland outside. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence and image density tighten once, reweighting the stake from “why green resists” to “kindness as phototropic engine.” No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors secured inside 120 words. One micro-turn: swarm/no-swarm hinges on past micro-gentleness; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The oasis is not backdrop but instrument: cracked hives, dry well, and lantern glass literally refract possible futures, constraining tactics. Micro-setting (glass shard, clay pinch) doubles as tool and perceptual filter; its final glint recharges the earlier seeding gesture. Sensory hierarchy obeys potter priorities—heat, texture, vibration—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: circling path, kneeling, hand-hover track without drift. Weather (scorched horizon, chimney smoke) affects timing of vision, not mere mood. 9+ gate met: glass constrains final meaning-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why life resists annihilation—signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened through two timeline images. Escalation is density-driven: overlapping futures thicken until kindness emerges as causal lever; narrowing options from “maybe bees return” to “maybe I already tilted the scale.” Protagonist agency lies in seed-and-clay offerings; cost = water rarer than sleep, bodily knees in grit, acceptance of uncertain outcome. No visible price beyond exhaustion, so 8.8+ band barely missed. Pattern break (sprouts lean) reweights stake with undeniable yet quiet payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: kindness as a weak but cumulative force that bends time. Subtext resides in gesture—clay pinch, hand-hover—never sermon. Final image reconfigures premise: survival depends not on grand resistance but on unwitnessed mercies that soak into soil. No tidy moral; ambiguity persists—wasteland still waits outside circle. The “sharp gentleness” itself is the thematic answer, returned as Charged Poise. No echoic thesis lines; only one near-platitude (“places resist change when enough kindness…”) but embedded in mid-story reflection, forgivable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to potter’s perceptual lens; diction (“kilns still worked,” “amber,” “ratcheted hive frame”) is potter-specific, never committee-voice. Rhythm lengthens and breathes with circling motion, compresses at epiphany—syntax mirrors wheel-throwing mindfulness. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay within clay/light/heat domain. Voice modulation under pressure: short, shard-like clauses when futures overlap. Lantern glass acts as built-in perceptual device, justifying slightly lyric heightening. Pattern of fractured timelines taught early and paid off at close—legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid algorithmic drums. Information-dense: one line often carries sensory, metaphoric, and causal payload. Only minor scaffold: “he wondered…” and “he thought…” appear twice but spaced, not clustered in closure zone. Metaphor coherence high—light/clay/bee motifs stay mutually reinforcing. No synonym churn or register drift. Final third clean of artifacts; closure image (“cooled porcelain fragile yet enduring”) lands pristine. Micro-loop: “sharp gentleness” coined twice; forgiven because it is thematic coinage, not accidental repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fused trope refresh: post-apocalyptic oasis + time-slipping oracle shard + ceramic cosmology feels non-obvious. Conceptual risk—quiet, non-confrontational climax—paid off via Charged Poise. Specificity of trade (clay memory, sun-pattern firing) prevents generic transfer; swap potter → gardener and logic collapses. Fresh inflection: kindness as literal photosynthetic force bending timelines. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
