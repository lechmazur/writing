<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Iri’s hybrid body and sensory vocation are vivid; the fossil-touch triggers a data-cascade and a felt pang, showing embodied contradiction. The floating renunciation crystallizes their charter into live cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lantern-led density tightens emotional residue into a spiral pattern that reweights the cave as mutual listening post. Closure—handing the fossil to the unknown—charges the final image with conceptual cost; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Coastal cave constrains every move: tide-level gates access, brine viscosity shapes buoyancy, lantern-projection turns stone into living archive; the fossil’s re-weighting in the final pool is inseparable from place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map the emotional wake for future wakers—tightens when spiral-traces reveal a non-human witness; floating becomes the visible price that forecloses retreat, deepening the archival mission under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from fossil-to-spiral arc: endurance as dialogue across species-time. Final plea to the unknown reconfigures human relic into inter-world covenant; no moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, sensor-saturated diction (“bone-glass,” “slow auroras”) stays inside Iri’s perceptual lexicon; rhythmic elongation matches cave echo. No head-hop; lantern-light modulates sentence cadence like pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, sensor-data, emotional weather—without metaphor glut; only one mixed vehicle (“ancient whale” ribs) but it doesn’t cloud closure. Propulsion clean; no loop or paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sensory-map maker as post-human archivist, emotion-heat as topography, and fossil-leaf as interlocutor fuse into fresh myth. Risk—floating alone toward unsleeping entity—paid off in uncanny yet inevitable closure.</comment>
