<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s shifting mimicry of lost voices is chillingly embodied; the narrator’s grief is likewise somatic, not labeled. The final hand-on-halo choice costs the tidy arithmetic of loss, earning the renunciation. Interior contradiction spikes when borrowed personas slip mid-sentence. Only the brother-crash memory feels briefly summary, not enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the geometry dissolves the “I” that was defined as the one left behind. Causal chain holds: star-death residue → topaz press → transposed empathy → shaken identity. Orientation anchors within 50 words; workshop/star pair is never confused. Cost is unmistakable in “sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz surfaces, inked type, and halo fragment are tactile tools that alter tactics; the translucent sheet refuses to admit it is ice becomes the final image’s pond. Star-death light is repurposed as emotional ink, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clean: narrator crosses from doorway to press to halo without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grief’s rigid equation—faces embodied test inside printed geometry. One tightening: hand-on-halo forecloses the safety of old certainties, price legible in “triviality.” Agency remains narrator’s throughout; Mara merely invites. Escalation is accretive: each borrowed persona layers pressure until geometry collapses the arithmetic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy is not understanding others but letting them rearrange your interior chairs. The final image reframes prior motifs—stars, type, geometry—as unstable constellations inside the skull. Ambiguity lingers, unresolved and potent. No moralizing, only reweighted grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accretive, synesthetic, yet anchored in bodily detail. Rhythm swells then fractures under halo pressure, mirroring dissolving geometry. No head-hopping; hallucinated personas are filtered through single “I.” Occasional elevated diction (“unnerving habit,” “diagnostic label-speak”) is brief enough not to rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences braid image, motion, and metaphor—high density, zero loops. Metaphors stay internally coherent: “grief hums beneath an ordinary day” sustains sonic motif. No scaffold; each line advances stance or image. One mixed metaphor—“drawer everyone rummaged through”—minor, not at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Star-inked empathy press is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sf-mystical grief tech. Personality-borrowing operator feels inevitable yet uncanny. Risk—lyric dissolution inside printed geometry—pays off by reconfiguring narrator’s self-boundaries. Specific detail prevents trope drift; no template plot beneath.</comment>
