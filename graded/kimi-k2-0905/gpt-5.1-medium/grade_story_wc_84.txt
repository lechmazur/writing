<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her headset hums, the cable-to-horizon slack is felt—but the moment of “tuning her heart” drifts into therapeutic shorthand. The micro-choice to map star-tones to faces is earned, yet the cost (her military identity) is implied rather than embodied in a final refusal or forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses—duty vs. yearning—co-exist in scene, not summary, lifting the score into the strong band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome’s starlight physically fills the chip’s absences, reconfiguring belonging from territory to pattern. Cost is legible—the chip’s glow is a visible price—under an Accumulative lens (density of star-tones) that holds without contradiction. The only hairline slip is the late articulation of “frequency of belonging,” which briefly risks thematic echo, but the final image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory’s rusted rib-cage telescope and cracked star charts are handled, not displayed: Mira leans her eye to the eyepiece, the stone floor receives the chip’s click. Starlight pooling through the dome breach directly constrains her mapping choice, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the chip on stone) doubles as celestial punch-card—irreplaceable, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus erased coordinates—is signaled early and tightens once: the star-tone map forecloses her old grid logic. The cost is conceptual (her war lens is obsolete) but felt on-page when the console hums new tones. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the slow shift of “missing pieces” from defect to invitation; no character sermonizes. The final image—chip glowing with starlight—offers a non-literal answer: belonging is mutual absence-sharing. Brief flirtation with the phrase “frequency of belonging” almost triggers echo penalty, but it is embedded in sensory action (console speaker) rather than moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mira’s drone-trained perceptual system—telemetry hum, grid logic—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors her targeting mind: short precise clauses, then dilates into longer star-mappings. Leto’s speech is distinctively archaic (“the sky has been trying to finish your sentence”), separating his voice without caricature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene: tight clauses under the dome’s pressure, then expansive star-catalogue sentences. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors—though “brilliant dimness” and “invisible cable” flirt with oxymoron clutter; context justifies them. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drone-pilot-turned-celestial-cartographer premise is fresh, but the “missing pieces = starlight” payoff feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test. Risk lies in collapsing military tech into antique star lore; the story commits fully, grounding the synthesis in tactile beats (eyepiece, console hum). No derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
