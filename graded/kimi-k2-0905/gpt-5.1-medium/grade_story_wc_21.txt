<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is specific—balancing on “the spine of history,” letting the past “scorch her”—and her micro-choice to kneel and whisper terms into the salt air crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (fear of contamination vs. hunger for truth) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final endurance—carrying the heavier diary—earns a credible renunciation of professional distance, foreclosing sterile detachment. Slight over-articulation of motive (“joined to uncover truth in tension”) keeps this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the diary’s added weight and the shoreline’s dark invitation reconfigure Maris’s archival ethic with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of lagoon, debris-letters, and diary pulses intensify density until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early (zeppelin, dusk, satchel) and pays off when the same shoreline rewrites her constellations. One minor scaffold—”Tonight began after the letters are found” could be compressed—does not touch the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating library ribs, swaying book-lanterns, and obsidian lagoon that “drinks the sky” are filtered through Maris’s archival gaze; each detail doubles as tool and metaphor. Micro-setting—the diary warming in her palm—constrains the choice to descend the rope ladder. Spatial choreography remains clean: rope ladder, dunes, debris-letters track without drift. The lagoon’s return in the final image recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—whether to let the past scorch her—tightens when the diary pulses hot and the debris spells KNEEL/WITNESS, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is present: she kneels and whispers terms, enduring retrocognitive overload as price. Escalation is textural—each spiral of symbols and shoreline mimic increases density rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: heavier satchel, torn breath, and the final acceptance of shared wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between sterile cataloging and embodied witness; no articulating character sermonizes. The lagoon shifts from tourist curiosity to devouring mirror, reweighting the premise that some archives must be lived, not shelved. Subtext lives in gesture—kneeling in sand, whispering terms—rather than exposition. Final image of the “past slightly less alone” offers non-literal resonance without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, rhythmic, and taught early: “books swaying like lanterns,” “night poured in like ink.” Compression—“breath a torn cloth”—is patterned and paid off under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is archivist-specific: constellations of letters, courthouse fluorescence, microfilm ladders. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Maris. Register never drifts into academic diction despite conceptual load.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: “moonlight could not pierce its surface; it seemed to drink the sky” does three jobs—sensorial, metaphorical, foreshadowing. Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato fragments under retrocognitive slam. One paraphrase loop—“truths buried deep enough to seem endless” echoes “no bottom, just layers…”—but occurs early and does not recur at closure. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent to lagoon-as-absence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating civil-rights library airship is fresh, yet grounded in archival labor; the premise is followed through—catalog cards sway, microfilm ladders dangle. Encrypted diary that hot-loads memory via shoreline semaphore is a non-obvious synthesis of analog and occult archiving. Risk—retrocognitive contamination—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if Maris is swapped out; her archival lens is integral to the concept’s payoff.</comment>
