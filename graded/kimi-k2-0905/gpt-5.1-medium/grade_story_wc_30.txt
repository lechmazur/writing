<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian’s hinge-hearted, brass-boned interiority is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (accepting contradictions, smelting selves) grows from the established mechanical-flawed self. The fisherman’s wan-dering identity is shown, not labeled, through his triple gaze and shivering question. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, only summarized across paragraphs, keeping it just below the 9+ gate. The final shared reflection is a credible, costly renunciation of singular selfhood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fisherman leaves carrying a newly alloyed, contradiction-tolerant identity, paid for by the librarian’s internal furnace and the absent moon’s tide. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure intensifies through image-density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“tidal atrium”), waived penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: “his reflection… borrows my metal jaw,” a mutual, irreversible metamorphosis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is not backdrop but instrument: water level dictates shelf access, the bamboo creel becomes a crucible, moon-phase absence thickens light. Glass bones, marble stacks, and flooded arches are tactile, lived-in, and constrain the smelting ritual. The creel’s reeds darken under “currents older than the marble,” a specificity that reweights the ending when returned lighter. Micro-setting (the creel, the librarian’s chest furnace) directly shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can wonder survive routine once tomorrow vanishes? Pressure mounts imagistically—moonlight thickens, tide rises to mid-shelves—culminating in the librarian’s single decisive intensification: smelt the fragmented selves or lose the fisherman to the tide. The act is not reversible; options narrow to accepting contradiction or dissolution. The cost is felt in the librarian’s gears turning “slow, tectonic,” and the fisherman’s newly shared reflection—visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: identity as alloy rather than essence, wonder preserved only by embracing internal contradiction. The returning image of borrowed reflection reweights earlier motif of migrating faces, crystallizing the thematic answer in action. No moralizing final paragraph; the last line’s shared cheeks are the quiet, charged poise. The concept re-prices the premise: selfhood is now knowingly plural, a conceptual cost paid in the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained metallic lyricism: “hinge-hearted,” “brass-boned,” “winter-pale but resolute.” Syntax mirrors clockwork tension—long breathless clauses that tighten into short furnace beats. Perceptual signature is consistent: the librarian notices tides, gears, unread spines; the fisherman notices salt taste, lantern that no longer burns. No head-hopping; even the shared reflection is focalized through the librarian’s perception of mutual borrowing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally: opening sentence sprawls, final sentence snaps into image. Metaphors are coherent—glass bones, marble stacks, moonlight thickening—none contradict prior physics. One paraphrase loop mid-text (“wandering… migrate… trade perches”) but momentum recovers. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses clockwork librarian + tidal archive + vanished tomorrow into an inevitable, non-obvious synthesis. The smelting of breath-sized selves via accepting contradiction is a fresh inflection on identity politics and grief. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring closure. If names or places changed, the alloy ritual would collapse; thus transformation is anchored in specific invented world logic.</comment>
