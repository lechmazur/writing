<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaper’s grief is concrete—his hollow chest, the lantern that “strictly refused to die,” the atlas he handles like a surgeon. Interior contradiction pulses: he both courts and fears each fear he names. The final renunciation—witness, not destroy—is earned by the child-memory that still “cuts,” and the cost is felt in the crystalline shards he keeps instead of souls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory floor glitters with named terrors, the reaper’s purpose reframed from harvest to witness. Causality holds: because the child’s sacrifice scarred him, he now crystallizes fears instead of reaping them. The atlas, lantern, and recordings form a closed causal loop that reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s dome, brass table, and salt-crystal geometry are tactile and constrain every ritual move; the cracked lens literally scatters the light that summons fears. Micro-setting (the lantern’s stutter) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: shards, atlas, phonograph remain tracked and handled across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming fears to atone—tightens when each recording releases a new creature that must be faced rather than scythed. Agency is renunciation: he keeps paying in regret and lantern-oil, each crystallized fear a visible price. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative, each voice adding density until the floor glitters with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the atlas monsters turned inward: external terrors become internal regrets. The echo of sacrifice reweights the final tableau—crystallized shards are both monument and prison. No moralizing; the image of scattered constellations on the floor answers the thematic question obliquely: memory is the only afterlife we can grant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at the reaper’s shoulder, diction archaic-tinged yet precise: “quavers,” “inkish,” “strictly refused to die.” Rhythm swells with phonograph whispers, then thins to the hush of salt crystals. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is his—light through cracked glass, fear tasted as dust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long, breath-held clauses to fragmentary shards mirroring the crystals. Figurative language is controlled—metaphors (ink in water, hollow instrument) never repeat or clash. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reverb without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing maritime bestiaries with psychopomp lore feels inevitable: map monsters become taxonomies of dread. The premise risks gimmick yet stays grounded in the reaper’s single regret. Scattered-light as summoning mechanic is fresh, taught early, and paid off when constellations fall to the floor. Transformation is complete—removing any element collapses the ritual logic.</comment>
