<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—ink-scented fingers, locket warming against ribs—but the contradiction between summoning Mara and claiming “I do not summon” is never acknowledged as self-deception, blunting the arc. Micro-choices (pressing photo, dipping pen, following footprints) track a clear value hierarchy; the final endurance of writing alone carries visible cost. Character voice remains singular and consistent; no label-speak intrudes. Missing only a sliver of interior contradiction to hit 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger now “heavy enough,” the covenant regenerated, the cost the solitude after Mara fades. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer steeping the paper tightens the stake until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: footprints exit the page, forcing the narrator to the jetty’s edge. Could use one more causal linkage between photo-steeping and Mara’s appearance to breach 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Jetty, tide, and paper bruising are tactile and filtered through archivist priorities; barnacle roses and phosphor footprints evolve with causality. Micro-setting (locket hinge, damp rail) constrains action—photo must be flattened, ledger braced. Twilight timeframe is signaled early and narrows perception. Final image of “stars came out and the paper finally felt heavy enough” recharges every prior sensory layer. One notch below 9 only because weather never complicates tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and intensifies each time ink meets salt. Mid-story tightening: footprints abandon the page, forcing narrator to choose follow or abandon covenant. Cost is legible: Mara’s euphoric but vanishing return leaves narrator writing alone under stars. Under Accumulative lens, density of blooming images reweights the stake; no coincidence resolves. One more beat of external resistance (wind smearing ink, festival guard interrupting) would push 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-weight emerges from concrete actions: bruising paper, steeping photo, ledger growing heavy. No explicit thesis; final image lets stars and paper mass speak. Subtext in Mara’s “sharper than joy” face implies covenant’s price is solitude. Ambiguity lingers—did Mara choose storm or was she claimed?—without confusion. Resonant reconfiguration achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, syntax elongates then snaps—“tired snakes shedding borrowed color”—mirroring tide’s inhale. Perceptual signature is archivist: ink smell, paper bruise, ledger weight. No head-hop; unreliability (denial of summoning) stays implicit. Compression taught early (“I prefer paper that can bruise”) pays off in final heaviness. One hairline slip: “gently thorough” feels coined rather than earned in dialogue; keeps it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—sea as page, footprints as commas—never mixed. Information density high: one sentence delivers ink color, tide argument, narrator oath. Minor scaffold: “barnacle roses opening into slick mouths” and “mussel shells unfolding like black tulips” stack vehicles within three lines, slightly diluting pressure. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic archiving meets tidal necromancy, memory quantified by bruise and weight. Covenant regeneration via proximate cause (ink, tide, photo) feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and controlled. Transformation test fails if relocated inland—salt and ledger essential. One-half step from 9 only because “walnut-ink archivist” label edges toward quirk without occupational detail.</comment>
