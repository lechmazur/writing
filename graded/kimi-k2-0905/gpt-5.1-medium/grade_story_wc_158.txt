<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The poet’s insomnia, need to transmute pain into beauty, and memory of his grandmother supply clear, embodied motives that escalate to the public song. Internal contradiction is thin—no moment where he almost turns back—and the “shyly unstoppable” trait is asserted, not probed under pressure, but his visible resolution to accept the moon’s phases earns a credible micro-change with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon’s return is negotiated through sung words, coral blooms, and the postcard image, all paying visible cost in public exposure and concession to imperfection. Causal chain is lyric but legible: song → coral path → revealed moon → poet’s acceptance; no beat is reversible without breaking the spell. Orientation is swift; “gargantuan shell” anchors place by line 3. Minor slack: the postcard’s “instructions” are declarative backstory, yet they tilt the present choice and are paid off when the card is lifted to sky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell city, reef corridors, and water-light are filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias toward luminescence and pain; each sensory note either guides movement or mirrors interior state. The gargantuan shell constrains the finale—threshold as negotiation stage—and the postcard’s star-glow micro-sets the closing image. Economy is high; no exposition dump. Spatial choreography passes the body/prop tracking test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the moon to ease communal sleeplessness—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when coral itself responds, forcing the poet to finish the lullaby with explicit terms of forgiveness. One meaningful tightening: the coral path forms only while he sings, narrowing option to “keep singing or lose the moon forever.” Cost is felt: public vulnerability, voice imperfect, acceptance of future shadows. Coincidence (clouds part) complicates but does not resolve; truce is still uttered and paid for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated beauty-through-pain emerges from bloom/next-night cycle, coral skeletons, and lullaby: no overt thesis stated. Subtext lives in coral “blossom armistice” image—bone-flowers carrying both frost and fragrance—re-pricing the premise that darkness and light must coexist. Final image of poet writing till dawn reconfigures sleeplessness from wound to vocation. No moralizing paragraph; resonance stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compressed lyric diction teaches its pattern in the first paragraph and holds: “listening ink,” “reef-shadow joy,” “water-light” are coinages that remain legible. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for spiral walking, staccato fragments when moon emerges—mirroring perception under insomnia. POV distance stays tight third; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings, high information density; metaphors stay physically coherent. One scaffold trace—“shyly unstoppable” repeated exactly—feels thematic, not accidental, but drifts close to template cadence. No mixed metaphors or register drift; nouns precise. Opening and closing lines carry punch. Minor paraphrase loop in “blossom armistice” explanation could compress, but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—poet in nautilus city sings moon back via coral accord—is fresh synthesis of cli-fi, myth, and lyric essay. Tropes (missing moon, lullaby, grandmother’s gift) are re-wired through insomniac art practice and bioluminescent reef politics. Specific detail (“barnacles pulsing like metronomes,” “kelp hammock”) prevents generic fantasy feel. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced yet paid off with legible closure.</comment>
