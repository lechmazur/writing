<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—truth-teller who fears commitment—drives every beat; the underwater vow he finally utters is the earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“green ringing that rang against his ribs”) rather than abstract. The only cap: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each glowing vow adds density until Elias’s own promise reweights the world. Closure is a Charged Poise—he surfaces hearing colors—cost paid in irrevocable perceptual shift. Pattern taught by line 3 (“color of sound”) and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the brass tag and drowned-library door physically constrain entry and choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s obsession—sound-as-color—so every plank and silt flake feels filtered. Gate met: tag recharges the final image when it flares clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he dare promise?—tightens once yet decisively when he speaks his vow underwater, foreclosing his life-long evasion. Cost is the new synesthetic burden he must now carry. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density alone reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation: abandoned promises still matter because they leave luminous traces. Final image answers the thematic question—what does it cost to vow?—by making perception itself the price. No moralizing, only reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: lamplighter diction, synesthetic metaphors, rhythmic pulse mirroring waves. No dialogue, so voice contamination impossible. Elision (“boots tasting the slick rungs”) is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences for underwater drift, tight fragments for surfacing. Zero loops or synonym churn; every image advances color-sound motif. Occasional elevated diction (“meteor hush”) is voice-motivated, not drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sunken vow-library is a fresh, risk-taking frame; premise requires synesthetic payoff and delivers it. Specificity of “hotel skeleton key tag” as library card transforms trope. Emotional truth—fear of commitment—anchors the fantastical device.</comment>
