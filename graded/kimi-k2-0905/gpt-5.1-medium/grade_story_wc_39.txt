<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poet’s “wistful courage” to open the box gives one vivid micro-choice, but interiority flirts with label-speak (“felt strangely rich…gleaned redemption”) rather than body. His loneliness is shown early, yet the moment of giving the jar away is under-dramatized—no contradictory impulse, so renunciation feels smoothed rather than paid for. Still, the body-in-sand cues anchor him and the final “step down” shows visible cost, keeping motivation legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the jar’s transfer crystallizes his vocation from hoarder to bridge-builder, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost implicit in “pockets empty except for pennies.” Causality is accumulative-textural; the pattern of bottling/listening taught early holds to the final image. Orientation is swift—dunes, dawn, loft—so no penalty; only the woman’s appearance edges coincidence, yet it complicates, not resolves, so allowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loft’s broken ribs, cracked slats, and sand crust charge the final image when he steps down, leaving the skeleton behind; micro-setting serves as constraint. Salt-scoured ballerina and wax-stoppered jars recur with re-weighted meaning at closure. Sensory pick is selective—briny mutter, wind through ribs—never catalogue. Spatial tracking stays clean: hatchway, threshold, descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate between generations—tightens once: he relinquishes the private music-box memory instead of selling it, narrowing his hoarder-option. Agency is present but soft; the woman’s arrival supplies external pressure, yet the decisive surrender is his. Cost is conceptual (emptied pockets) rather than viscerally felt; still, under accumulative lens the cadence shift from solitary bottling to communal handing-over reweights stakes acceptably.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: inter-generational silence is sweetened by shared sound, not explained. The lullaby’s missing notes embody the theme—brokenness made honest. Final image of “jars of lonesome splendor” recharges earlier motif without moral tag. Subtext lingers in granddaughter-screen silence versus jar-prayer, inviting reflection beyond page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: “sand crusted in eyelashes,” “sound like shy birds,” rhythmic control mirrors tidal listening. Free-indirect stays clean; no head-hop. Compression (“gleaned redemption”) is taught by prior pattern of trading sounds; payoff clear. Diction stays within vagrant poet’s ken—no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm swells and contracts with wind/music motifs; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: ribs-timbers, birds-notes, knot-absolution. High density—“jars slept yesterday’s footsteps” fuses object, emotion, time in eight words. Only minor filter verb (“he felt”) in closing beat, but does not obscure cost image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sound-bottling conceit is fresh yet grounded; magic feels folk-real, not gimmick. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens emotional cadence without clarity loss. Specificity of faceless ballerina and salt-bitten brass prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if relocated: dunes, jars, loft are inseparable from resonance.</comment>
