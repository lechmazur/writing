<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Noel’s contradictory need to erase and resurrect his musical past is dramatized in concrete beats: selling the turntable for the meteorite, tying melody-bars to birds, finally writing the forbidden song. Interiority is specific—dust as “slow trumpet,” guilt as attic balance—never abstract. The final act of releasing the bird with the completed song is earned; it costs him the last relic of his erased identity. Yet the woman’s pressure is mostly declarative; her presence supplies the pivot but not a fully reciprocal crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust motes, pigeon routes, and meteorite build density until the final song-tying reweights meaning with undeniable cost. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bird carries both the song and the proof that trust can survive its own ruins. Orientation is swift—attic, dawn, rain-smell within 60 words. No causal contradictions; every beat adds texture that the final image retroactively charges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Attic functions as micro-setting: warped floorboard dictates balance, skylight-slit scripts the dust-map used to chart pigeon routes. Sensory triangulation—cardboard mildew, wing-beat drafts, meteorite heft—directs Noel’s ritual choices. The setting never stalls; each descriptor enables the next tactical move (naming birds, plotting dust-route, tying song). Final image of dusk turning dust to “drifting ink” re-anchors the space as the launch site for trust’s repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the echo of lost music outlive its guilt? Pressure tightens once: the woman’s arrival forces Noel from denial to composition. Escalation is textural—each pigeon carries a melodic bar, accumulating until the single missing song is demanded. Cost is visible: writing the song re-opens the fire trauma and irrevocably attaches his name to it again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—trust as unfinished melody—emerges through recurring images of partial transmission (incomplete song, meteorite chip, dust motes). Subtext operates in silence: pigeons “watchfully still” when the sister’s death is named, wordless acknowledgment of shared guilt. Final image reframes prior motifs: the released bird is both confession and absolution, no moral stated. Ambiguity is productive: faith survives ruins, yet ruins remain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Noel’s perceptual signature: dust as musical notation, coos as “chords slipped out of human frequency.” Syntax mirrors his precarious balance—long, tilting sentences that resolve into terse renunciations. No head-hops; woman’s interiority surfaced only through what Noel can read (folder swelling, cuff shine). Compression is purposeful: “music was falling stones” condenses an entire aesthetic theory without explication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from lung-full catalogues of sense to clipped denials (“I wrote many songs…”). Figurative language is dense but patterned—dust = staves, city = score—taught early and paid off at closure. No scaffold loops; each line advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“unspooling life”) is marginally outside Noel’s likely lexion but reads as lyrical magnification rather than register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—guilt-ridden composer using pigeons to smuggle lost melodies—feels fresh yet inevitable. Meteorite-as-relic and dust-as-map are specific inventions, not stock symbols. Transformation test: story collapses without pigeon-music conceit. Risk is taken: quiet lyric closure instead of courtroom confrontation. Slight proximity to “musician haunted by fire” trope is offset by avian courier twist and textural rather than confessional arc.</comment>
