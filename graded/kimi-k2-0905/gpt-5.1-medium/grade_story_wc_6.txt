<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s contradictory impulses—firefighter discipline versus arsonist’s daughter shame—are dramatized in the single beat of shielding the boy while feeling heat on her neck. The coin graft is a micro-choice that visibly costs her the last relic of her father, earning the quiet closure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the boy’s motivation is slightly abstract, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she hears the boy, therefore she turns her back on the fire; because she gives the coin, therefore the curse is communal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her father’s coin now tied to the boy’s jar—cost legible in the surrender of her final keepsake. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the fire crew’s arrival is slightly convenient, but the emotional cost has already landed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The obsidian lagoon and hot dune sand constrain every tactical step; the Mirror’s stillness contrasts the crackling grass, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—salt-softened smoke, kelp-drift peace—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: dune crest, water line, fire line track without drift. Micro-setting (jar, coin) functions as setting and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she repeat or repair her father’s legacy—tightens when she must choose between fire suppression and the boy. One meaningful turn: she turns her back on the flame, narrowing her own safety. Cost is visible in the coin surrender. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; coincidence (crew arrival) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt and communal healing emerges through the coin-to-jar graft, never stated. Final image reweights the Mirror from site of paternal destruction to shared restoration. Subtext operates in the boy’s barefoot stance and the jar’s black sand—curse made tangible. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the quiet “ease” of the last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maris’s firefighter perception: hose-coupling memory, wind calculus, salt-softened smoke. Syntax mirrors her dancer-like alertness—long lyrical sentences that compress under pressure. No head-hopping; boy’s interior is revealed only through dialogue and tremble. Distinct perceptual signature holds through final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “fire loved distraction” does double duty as metaphor and character memory. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—one mixed metaphor (“flames leaping… doubling the terror”) but it does not touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with heat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—arsonist’s daughter as firefighter—could be schematic, but the black-sand curse and coin graft particularize it. Risk is taken in the quiet ending that chooses symbolic repair over heroic extinguishing. Fresh inflection: the curse is broken by shared holding, not solo sacrifice. Not quite 9 because the boy’s “restless feet” curse edges toward folklore shorthand.</comment>
