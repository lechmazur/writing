<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized in her immediate, tender reply to the silo and in her sustained mediation among volunteers; the palm-to-steel beat shows embodied empathy driving choice. Interiority stays concrete and music-lensed (“floury accents,” “corn dust and locomotive breath”). The slight abstraction in “vigorously tender” is offset by visible micro-choices—opening hatches, guiding choristers—so the trait works as motive, not label. Cost is present but diffuse (exhaustion implied, not staged), keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each hourly chime layers density until the final plaza canon reweights the stake—city-as-one-body. Closure is a Charged Poise: the open chutes exhale cool air while the crowd hears itself “many chambers, beating in time,” a crystallized image whose conceptual cost (permanent public intimacy) is undeniable. Causality holds via the pinecone weight chain and the multilingual braid that resolves discord into harmony; no off-stage solves. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“inside its wheezing stone ribs worked Mara”) and again at descent, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clock tower, grain-elevator ribs, and swaying pinecone weight are tactile tools that constrain tactics (chain route dictates repair sequence, bins become organ pipes). Sensory triage—dust applause, “mice and memory,” floury accents—mirrors emotional arc without catalogue glut. Spatial choreography is clean: chain runs down fissure, volunteers circle bins, final plaza gathers farmers beside bankers. The astronomical dial and hourly chimes function as micro-setting that pulses the ending, satisfying 9+ gate for charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: liberate the silo’s voice to liberate the city’s silences—signalled when elevator first whispers names. Escalation is accumulative: each bolt turned, language added, hour struck thickens texture until midnight chute-opening offers irreversible exposure; cost is the city’s new audible interdependence. No coincidence resolves; the contralto naming choristers underfoot is earned by earlier listening sessions. The tightening is single but decisive—midnight release forecloses sealed anonymity forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—silos (physical, linguistic, social) must become bridges—emerges through concrete acts, not assertion. Multilingual canon literalizes the idea that difference creates harmony; final “many chambers, beating in time” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing paragraph; wisdom stays in the image of grainless chutes breathing night air across strangers. Counter-readings linger: bridges may collapse, shared breath may infect—complexity invited, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Mara’s musician ear: “dust motes moved like silent metronomes,” diction filtered through choral cognition. Rhythm swells/ebbs with scene—short clauses for descent tension, elongated phrases for open-throat release. No head-hopping; volunteer voices surface only as choral texture (“Hola,” “bonjour”) consistent with Mara’s conductor ear. Non-standard lowercase opener “under the hush...” teaches quiet pattern paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “wheezing stone ribs,” “fractured harvest metaphors,” each noun/verb pair fresh yet precise. Metaphors interact—starlight is both borrowed and returned via open chutes—no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loops absent; adjacent sentences advance rather than echo. One minor scaffold: “When disagreements flared... she mediated like a conductor” could compress, but it occurs mid-scene, not in closure third, so 9-band allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—talking grain elevator healed by multilingual choir—risks whimsy yet grounds in tactile mechanics (cuckoo weight chain, rusted hatch). Fresh synthesis: urban-planning rehab merged with choral tuning, turning agriculture metaphor literal. Language-braid transforms familiar community-art trope; final image of city as single beating organ reconfigures familiar “bring people together” arc. Risk pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
