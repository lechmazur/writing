<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elya’s interiority is textured and embodied—her doubt is dramatized through the micro-choice of ignoring the clipboard and following color instead of score. The visitor’s arrival catalyzes a credible micro-shift that costs Elya her need to guide, replacing it with co-listening. Their open-ended stance at the end is an Earned Stasis that forecloses certainty, visible in the final “rough-edged texture” line. No diagnostic label-speak; all emotion is anchored in tactile bell-work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pilgrimage rule-set is repriced from “guide the stranger” to “be guided by what they hear,” with the cost being Elya’s relinquished authority. Causality is accumulative/textural—color-bends and bell-harmonics build density until the visitor’s need reframes the ritual. The lens is taught early (color → memory → belief) and holds without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by line 8; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The miner's lens is micro-setting-as-tool: it refracts lantern-light into color that literally steers Elya’s striker, constraining her sequence choice. Golden shadows modulate from celebratory to honest as power returns below but remains fragile above, mirroring the shift from scripted to co-created pilgrimage. Bell-wires, jars of silent bird calls, and cracked cylinders are specific, lived-in, and filtered through her tuner's ear. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions as visitor climbs and both stand inside the lattice of tones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elya’s need to feel authentic connection—tightens when she abandons the grant-promised score, trading institutional approval for co-improvised sound. One meaningful deepening: the visitor’s raw admission “I needed somewhere the lights might fail again” reweights the blackout from inconvenience to existential honesty, forcing Elya to risk unscripted resonance. Cost is legible: she forfeits measurable outcomes and exposes her process to a stranger’s unfiltered need. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: authenticity arises not from leading but from surrendering control and listening. Subtext lives in gesture—visitor clutching railing, Elya lowering striker yet not hiding it—showing vulnerability rather than declaring it. The final image of “two questions listening for each other” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise. No moralizing or thematic echo; ambiguity lingers about whether the bells will ever work again, which is the point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Elya’s perceptions: color shivers “like water trying to remember being rain”—a metaphor she could plausibly invent. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments under bell-strike tension, mirroring her shift from analytical to intuitive. No head-hopping; visitor’s interior is surfaced only through Elya’s reading of swollen eyes and grip on railing. Diction stays within a sound-artist’s lexicon—harmonic, droplet, lattice—without crowding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied: long anaphoric clauses build suspension, then short percussive beats match striker contacts. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No paraphrase loops; “color shivered…like water” is the only metaphor cluster in the climax and it pays off the lens motif. Minor scaffold: “the thought did not comfort her, yet it loosened something” could compress, but it does not blunt the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The artificial pilgrimage concept is freshly inverted: instead of tech-enabled transcendence, success requires abandoning protocol and embracing fragility. Bells tuned to memories, prism-light guiding sound, and a blackout that makes honesty possible synthesize into a singular speculative micro-world. The risk of letting the first participant arrive unscheduled feels organic, not engineered for twist. Without these exact elements the emotional reconfiguration would collapse—hence high irreplaceability.</comment>
