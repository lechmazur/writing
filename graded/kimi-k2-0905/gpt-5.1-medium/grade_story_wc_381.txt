<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ilen’s interiority is lush and embodied—his chest tightens as each prophecy-thread dissolves—but the “tranquil blaze” motive never complicates or contradicts itself; compassion is declared, not battle-tested. No flaw or blind spot surfaces to create an internal reversal, so the final stance feels serene rather than costly. Still, the micro-choice to let the brook speak through the paper’s silence valleys is specific and irreversible, earning a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught by sentence two—“night folded itself”—and holds: each hush-layer thickens until the final image reweights silence as future possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane’s glow pours over water, futures un-fixed, cost felt in Ilen’s bone-heaviness. One soft spot: the prophecy’s mechanics (why a rhythm collapses kingdoms) is asserted, not demonstrated, but the pattern pays off in the luminous final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brook-as-micro-setting actively receives the silence-lattice; its “low, companionable murmur” is the altered state that lets the valley exhale. Paper crane, reed gossip, and firefly orbits are tactile, never touristic, and each is re-handled to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible wing angles or water placement. This is the rare 600-word piece where environment, body, and tool fuse into one constraint engine.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—still the prophecy’s echo—tightens once: when Ilen lays hush inside each far-off tavern-hole, his bones gain weight, options narrow to endurance. No reversal, but the density shift is legible and irreversible. Cost is visible—“weight added to his bones”—and shapes the final poise. Could push higher if the prophecy had fought back with a micro-turn, but the single deepening is purposeful under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of curating possibility: silence is not void but fertile dark. The refrain of “blank space as valley where sound went to rest” re-weights at closure when fireflies sketch *new* constellations. No moral is stated; the resonance is in the image shift. Minor deduction for the abstract “kingdoms would move accordingly,” which slightly telegraphs the stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at psychic distance two, never leaking omniscience; perception is filtered through Ilen’s breath-rhythm and cartographic silence-reading. Syntax lengthens and contracts with inhalation beats—“nested rooms of quiet”—creating a thrum that is neither monotone nor algorithmic. Diction stays within a summoner-poet’s lexicon; no corporate register drift. The voice is singular enough that substitution would collapse the texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line craft: every sentence layers image and causality—“fireflies wrote brief constellations” does triple sensory, metaphoric, and foreshadowing work. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The only hairline slip is “terrestrially cosmic” appearing twice; the second feel fractionally ornamental, but the repetition is purposeful echo, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hush it describes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—“silence as cartography against prophecy”—is non-obvious and fully committed: no late-breaking spell or dialogue saves the day. Origami-as-silence-engine feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh in execution. Risk is taken with lyric abstraction, but coherence never wavers. Minor proximity ding for “fireflies wrote constellations,” which faintly echoes pop-culture star-writing, yet the image is re-seeded with paper-ink constellations to transform the trope.</comment>
