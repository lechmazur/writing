<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific; the narrator’s shame about “crooked” family speech and the micro-choice to speak aloud in the niche are embodied and costly. The only flaw: the epiphany edges toward diagnostic summary (“I understood then that my talents for forgetting…”) just before the climax; a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “hidden thunder” reweights the premise—home is not a place but a mouth forced open by language. Cost is felt in the pain behind ribs and the audible cracking of “sealed rooms.” Causal linkage holds: the stone’s demand → protagonist speaks → thunder inside bones. No orientation debt; mountain, niche, and map are anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain functions as a living constraint: moving shelves, lanterns of stained pages, and the spring-fed ink all shape navigation and possibility. The niche’s glass that feels “feathered” is the micro-setting object that literally unlocks the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. Just shy of 9+ because the exterior storm is only acoustically registered—no tactile consequence on skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a speakable home—tightens when the stone demands burial be reversed; the on-page trade-off is acute: speak the ashamed tongue or remain sealed. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each remembered lullaby narrows the option to keep forgetting. Cost is visible in chest pain and audible thunder inside bones. One minor dip: the seer’s gate could have applied harder pressure after admittance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox that “lost language” is not foreign but the intimate, half-hummed cradle speech; the ending’s “shape of home returning in the language that named every room” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; the thunder image reconfigures meaning without exposition. Subtext in the mercury-glass eyes reflecting “shaken fragments” quietly foretells the shattering of sealed memory rooms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: noticing “pages torn from granite,” “shy teeth” of hidden letters, “geometry of absences.” Syntax grows more liquid under pressure—final paragraph’s breath-long sentence mirrors the unstoppering of speech. No head-hopping; distance stays internal. One hairline slip: “diagnostic” tag “memory-burdened child” could have been left to the seer’s diction alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is exemplary; sentence lengths swell and contract with the protagonist’s breath. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as “pulse-warm,” glass as “ghosted friction.” No scaffold loops; each image advances either atmosphere or causality. Minor density surge in the lantern/page paragraph but it pays off by teaching the world rule that air itself “reads,” justifying later linguistic infiltration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain that “substitutes reality nightly” is a fresh crucible for the oldest theme—mother tongue versus empire language—made specific through the feather-textured lock and the stone that seeds “new tongues” by forcing old ones. The inversion that the “lost language” is the private family dialect, not an extinct national one, feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds causal pressure to the final thunder inside bones.</comment>
