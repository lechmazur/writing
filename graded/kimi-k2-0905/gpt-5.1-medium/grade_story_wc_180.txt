<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is specific—quartz-eye, repair bag, ribbon fetish—and his guilt is embodied through the echoing nave. Yet the daughter remains a projection (vision in the apple) rather than an on-page force, so the relational crucible is off-stage and the final vow feels lone, not mutually tested. Still, his micro-choices (pruning, apology, ribbon as covenant) visibly cost him pride and safety, earning the renunciation of ownership.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative lens: each image (contract ashes, feral orchard, ribbon rain) layers density until the closing “slow rain of petals” reweights stakes from legal title to seasonal caretaking. The orientation anchor—“by the time the apples ripened in the rafters”—arrives inside the first line, satisfying the ~120-word rule. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the deciduous vow forecloses repossession and crystallizes a charged poise with conceptual cost—he accepts perpetual uncertainty. One causality hiccup: the bag contents (lens, wire, lead) appear as a late inventory rather than seeded tools, but they don’t break the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<comment>Orchard-in-cathedral is more than postcard: roots buckle flagstones, stained glass becomes grafting scaffold, and the ripe apples mirror in the quartz eye—details that constrain tactics (he must climb via ruined glass) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors proprioception and sound over visual catalog. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the cracked lens and copper wire act as portable terrain that enables the high-branch reach. Spatial choreography stays clean as the narrator’s body navigates hooks, counterweights, and falling petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—custody of the orchard—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each surreal growth phase (branches through glass, roots under slabs, alien-colored fruit) tightens the cost of staying. The decisive tightening is the narrator’s spoken vow beneath the “watchful” trunk, which forecloses the legal option to reclaim or sell. Price is visible: he commits to indefinite, unpaid tending with no guarantee of daughter’s return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of property into stewardship; the apple-vision reframes ownership as seasonal compost rather than immutable contract. Subtext lives in gesture—tying the ribbon is both apology and new covenant—avoiding explicit moral. Final image (petal rain) offers Conceptual Repricing: the same spell-system that once enforced bank title now answers with blossom, reweighting value from capital to caretaking. No late platitudes; the “accidental wisdom” stays in the daughter’s mocking rustle, keeping theme earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a mender’s tactile diction: “coax fractures into alignment,” “deciduous grammar.” Perceptual signature is material—glass, wire, sap—never drifting into academic register. Compression is taught early (“the contract lay in ashes”) and paid off in the final petal fall. No head-hopping; the daughter’s voice arrives only through orchard rustle, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long lyrical accumulations crash into staccato cuts (“I refused, tore the contract”). No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (contract risk = moss, soft until pulled). One template cadence appears—three consecutive “I…”—in the vow paragraph, but it mirrors incantatory intent and does not obscure causality. Information density high: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, and world rule (“spells shuddered, turning the orchard feral”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses ecclesiastical ruin with arboreal rebellion, then subverts it into anti-capitalist parable—fresh without gimmickry. The “deciduous vow” concept grows inevitable in hindsight: every prior image (ashes, ripe fruit, ribbon knots) prepares the closing petal covenant. Risk—lyric orchard that answers back—heightens stakes without clarity loss. Specificity: “quartz-eye” is not just flair but the literal seeing device that delivers the vision beat.</comment>
