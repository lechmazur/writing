<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living-statue POV delivers a consistent, mineral slowness that permeates every beat; interiority is anchored to tactile stone nerves and silt breath, never generic. The climactic consent—her gloved palm on the cracked column—externalizes the moral pivot cleanly. Reflection stays ≤20 % and is tied to present micro-choices (dislodging silt, widening fault-lines). Flaw: the moment of “fear” is named rather than embodied; a hairline slip at the hinge beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: secret spoken → garden awakens → statue must fracture city → recruits diver → collapse engineered. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“underwater city garden clung to a collapsed avenue”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ceiling rupture lets sea and daylight swap places, cost paid in the statue’s deeper embedment—visible on-page. Minor drag: the rulers’ back-story is delivered in one dense paragraph; still inside BRR limit, but slightly dilutes immediacy before the final ascent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lantern-corals, barnacled stone ribs, and the foxglove-ampoule’s color scatter are worked through action, not postcard lists. Micro-setting (the cracked column) physically constrains the final consent beat and later collapses, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography keeps diver, statue, and column in tight triangulation. One anemone-painted lion drifts past like a pale fish—vivid, but could have returned to charge the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the secret be replaced by a new certainty?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the ampoule becomes the portable verdict. Escalation is causal: each pull at the fault-line narrows escape options and increases flood risk to the diver. Price is concrete: the statue sacrifices its own mobility forever; she risks suit tear and nitrogen narcosis. No reversal beyond the single consent moment, but that is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Certainty vs. nuance emerges through the image cascade of cracked stone, loose ink, and daylight spearing down—“truth should arrive as cascading revelations” is dramatized, not asserted. Final image reweights the premise: the statue, once monolith of dogma, becomes porous reef for future questions. Subtext in the ampoule’s tilted colors and the bell’s rust song avoids moralizing. No tidy maxim; the thematic aftertaste is a question readers must carry upward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person mineral POV sustains a slow, sedimentary rhythm: “stone ribs ached as they flexed,” “silt billowed like breath from old lungs.” No head-hop; telepathy stays within stone nerve limits. Syntax grows shorter under tectonic stress—“Columns groaned… crack widened.” Distinct perceptual signature: time measured in accreted guilt, color read through algae filtration. Dialogue-free design is earned; voice never defaults to explain-to-reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers geology, history, and moral pressure. Metaphors stay internally consistent (ink, stone, tide). One paraphrase loop: “certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root” echoes earlier “cracked wide enough” but is deliberate reprise. No filter-verb clusters or mixed vehicles. Final line cadence slows to match receding water—rhythm serves closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Flood-invited-by-rulers twist is fresh; statue as living archive of civic guilt transforms familiar Atlantis trope. Ampoule of algae-coded light is a specific, non-portable object that could not be swapped for generic USB drive. Risk taken in telepathic stone narrator pays off through sustained voice. Conceptual integrity holds: the city drowns itself to erase dissent—no retreat into metaphor. Minor proximity to Borges/Calvino echoes, but voice and mineral embodiment feel singular.</comment>
