<comment>Lio’s seasonal muteness and tactile eloquence create a vivid, embodied contradiction; the moment he places the iceberg shard and accepts voice-loss is a credible micro-choice with cost. Interiority stays concrete (“ice forming behind his teeth”). No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped; head-count clean. The renunciation of speech is earned by prior causal chain—winter always takes his voice—so the endurance qualifies as Earned Stasis. Flaw: no visible contradiction inside the final beat; emotion is single-register acceptance, keeping him just shy of 9-band complexity.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hanging relics → wind chord → visitor cleansing is taught early and re-weighted when the shard re-tunes the tower. Closure is a Charged Poise: sculpture keeps singing, Lio’s voice gone, cost is legible (“last warmth of speech leave his throat”). Orientation anchored by line 3 (“whispering bluff above the clouds”). No lens ambiguity; pattern holds. Micro-drag: causal linkage between shard and city-wide “pause” is implied not shown, a hairline gap preventing 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting = kinetic tower; its brass arms and mirrored vanes constrain where/how the shard is cradled and directly charge the final sonic image. Selective sensory economy: wind, altitude, glint of light through ice—each filtered via Lio’s tuner perception. Spatial choreography clean (“climbed its narrow ladders…carved a cradle”). Tone of hushed altitude supports theme of unsayable wonder. Weather actively participates (wind drives chords). 9-band gate met: tower’s kinetic bones foreclose placement options and determine climax timbre.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake = preserve wonder’s color before global graying; signaled by girl’s frost-steam arrival. Escalation is the shard’s insertion into tower: wind seizes arms, new chord emerges, cities pause—options narrow for Lio (voice exits) and world (gray temporarily held off). Cost paid on-page: muteness arrives, “last warmth of speech” lost. Agency = carving cradle, setting shard, accepting silence. Slight deduction: choral effect on cities is reported not dramatized, keeping cost one step removed from reader skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—wonder is un-ownable light that moves on—through image chain: shard glistens → sculpture sings → people glance up, no moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture-only society and wind-grammar of bells. Final image of ongoing, wordless music reweights prior material without sermon. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis. Ambiguity embraced: cities will forget, sculpture still sings. Emotional aftereffect = quiet re-enchantment. Slight reserve: could use one more grounded particular to push into 9+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric, stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is tuner’s interval-thinking (“thinking in intervals instead of sentences”). Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for wind-swept bluff, then clipped precision during cradle-carving. Metaphors are musician-specific, never mixed. No head-hopping. Experimental elisions (“after words become unnecessary”) are pattern-taught and paid off. Voice sustains muted vigor throughout. Minor tic: occasional luxuriant adjective clusters (“impossible greens and blues”) but they occur in low-pressure beat, not under climax stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver tuning action, sensory flare, and emotional register (“Wind pushed an arm…bells answered with shifting chords that no tongue could lie through”). No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay physically coherent. Varied sentence openings; paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Micro-drag: one stock phrase (“furniture of the heart”) slightly clichéd, −0.3. Otherwise artifact-free, even at closure. Read-aloud ear test passes; prose propels without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—mutely tuning truth from abandoned relics via kinetic wind-sculpture—is non-obvious synthesis of sound-art, post-language society, and climate-loss. Iceberg shard as portable wonder-color feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if Lio is renamed—his occupation drives every beat. Risky lyric structure (no dialogue, causal gaps) heightens atmospheric stakes and lands cleanly. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Specific detail throughout (“brass bones and hanging glass organs”) prevents abstraction. Bold concept executed without gimmickry.</comment>
