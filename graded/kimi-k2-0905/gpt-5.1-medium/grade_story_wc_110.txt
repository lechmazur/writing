<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The registrar’s solitude, notebook fetish, and eventual wordless outreach are sharply particular; her contradictory need for both secrecy and connection is embodied in the micro-choice to offer the lens. The final silent pact is earned because the doodles and archive acts dramatize her flattening. Cost is felt: the rain-soaked tickets become a fragile bridge she must publicly defend. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, ink, glass, and mist externalize her stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared silence with the stranger crystallizes a new rule—transparency can exist inside the surveillance archive—at visible cost to her anonymity. Causal chain holds: contraband tickets → lens trick → recognition of mirrored isolation → wordless confession. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“campus perimeter”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the projector lens is introduced, used, and re-offered in a clean loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s rain-slick balustrades refract light into halos that literally guide the registrar’s UV trick; setting constrains both method and mood. Micro-setting—the damp tickets beading condensation—functions as tactile timepiece and trust gauge. Spatial choreography is immaculate: from archives hall to plaza fringe, bodies and objects track without drift. Weather is not backdrop but catalyst: rain schedules the concert and enables the final silver-mist communion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve secrecy vs. risk connection—tightens when anonymous doodles mirror her own habits, forcing a public stance. One meaningful escalation: pocketing the tickets (preservation) flips to walking toward the hooded stranger (exposure), cost legible in the pounding heart that “seemed another instrument.” No coincidence resolves; the stranger’s return is patterned, not lucky. Pressure peaks at the fringe of the collective mind-field, options narrowing to lens-offer or perpetual erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—language’s residue can still broker trust—emerges through image, not statement: graphite storms on tickets replace spoken thought. Final image of “mistrust cracked like thin ice” reweights the archive’s ethos without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive: we never learn the stranger’s agenda, yet the shared paper reconfigures both lives. No thematic echo; the registrar never spells out a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to the registrar’s perceptual filter: “droplets…seemed to listen,” “hum of spent thunder”—a hush-tech argot she would own. Syntax lengthens under hesitation, then fragments as she steps forward, mirroring risk. No head-hop; the stranger’s interior is unknowable, preserving POV modesty. Dialogue is absent by design, so voice lives in tactile metaphor and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist still braided with the lamps” fuses sensory layers in one verb. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—arrows as sutures, tickets as talismans—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Occasional Latinate elevation (“resonant hush,” “communal field”) is justified by the registrar’s archival diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit memory-archivist decoding doodled concert tickets to find her mirror—feels fresh, not a trope checklist. The UV-lens trick and rain-scheduled telepathy concert synthesize archival noir with lyric SF. Risk is high: almost no dialogue, stakes hinge on graphite smudges, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if names change; the crystal forecourt, lens, and ticket medium are irreplaceable.</comment>
