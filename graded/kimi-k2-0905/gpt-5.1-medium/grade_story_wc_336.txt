<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s shift from numb exile to tentative planter is embodied in the trembling warmth of the seed-touch; the final “first true hope” lands because we watched the gray city memory tighten around the choice. Lior’s function as mentor is thin—no interior contradiction or visible cost—so the relationship crucible never ignites. Still, the narrator’s micro-choices (watching, imagining, watering with memory) earn the Earned Stasis closure with felt cost: the city remains gray, the orchard merely offers a thread.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the seed absorbs the imagined rainbow-city, the orchard brightens, and the narrator’s stance reconfigures from spectator to keeper; the cost is the unspoken probability that the city may never change. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each imagistic layer (gray memory → color wish → seed glow) tightens the cadence rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet-waterfall micro-setting functions as constraint: the fray-and-braid stone is the only place the seed can be planted, so geography directly shapes the final act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—bruised-leaf scent, mist-cool cheek—never touristic. The orchard’s “twisted trunks” and shifting iridescence in the seed charge the closing image without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can wonder be re-planted in me?”—is signaled early and tightens through imagistic accretion rather than external opposition; the single meaningful deepening occurs when the seed drinks the rainbow-city vision, narrowing options to keeperhood or retreat. Cost is legible: the narrator now carries forward the possible failure of that vision. No external antagonist is needed; internal gray vs. possible color supplies sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as water, wonder as perennial cutting regrown. The final image of leaves “newly awake” reweights the earlier “gray city” without moralizing. Subtext in Lior’s “treaty with the air” whispers that every act of preservation is also a violence—never spelled out. Complexity is honored: the city may stay gray, the orchard may fail, yet the choice still matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, devotional cadence that modulates into breathless urgency during the seed-planting beat; syntax lengthens then fractures, mirroring wonder overload. Perceptual signature is consistent: color-as-taste, memory-as-scent. No dialogue clutter; the two spoken lines carry subtextual invitation rather than exposition. Register never drifts into pseudo-philosophy; diction stays within the narrator’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: strong verbs (“pruning ghosts,” “shivered with light”) and selective metaphor avoid purple overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The single risky stack—“branches reaching down into my city, up into unfamiliar constellations”—earns its sweep because it pays off immediately in the seed-glow. Punctuation and tense remain stable; no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “orchard that prunes ghosts” is a fresh synthesis of agrarian and metaphysical, transformed through tactile detail rather than trope recycling. The gray-city-to-seed conduit feels inevitable in hindsight, not borrowed. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no city saved, only a stance crystallized—but the commitment to that small-scale wager is authentic. One minor echo of “memory steeped in sunlight” skirts cliché but is redeemed by context.</comment>
