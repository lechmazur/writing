<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dye master’s desire to “learn why some people magnetize stories” propels every beat; his quiet micro-choice to display the morpho wing crystallizes that motive. Interiority is concrete—“borrowed heart kept time with strangers becoming luminous”—and the final bow registers earned cost. No contradiction in impulses, though the courier & child remain functional rather than crucible. The old-heart / new-heart contrast supplies ongoing embodied tension without diagnostic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wing’s shimmer reframes the patrons as mirrors, not magnets, re-weighting the core question with visible cost—his bow acknowledges unrecoverable distance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each added testimony thickens the mist of longing until the final image re-configures meaning. Orientation is clean—floating tea-house, dusk, valley mist all anchored by word 60. No causal reversal is needed under this lens; the single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tea-house-as-setting actively constrains the climax: its slats let dusk-light slice in to ignite the wing, enabling the re-framing image. Selective sensory economy—“valley-mist wonder seeped,” “surface trembling like mica”—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, kettles, wing track cleanly. Environment, body (chest), and tool (wing) triangulate to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the new heart reveal the magnetism secret?—tightens through pattern accumulation: each patron’s shorter tale compresses more longing. Agency remains observational, but that stance is the only path compatible with his surgical gift; final display of wing is the decisive act that forecloses pure spectatorship. Cost is legible in “borrowed heart” and audible clinks against ceramic—felt, not declared. No coincidence resolves; mist merely listens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: people do not attract stories, they mirror one another’s hunger. Subtext operates in gesture—the courier sets satchel “as carefully as if it were a sleeping child,” encoding unspoken cargo. The morpho wing’s iridescence re-prices the concept of magnetism into reflection without a moralizing sentence. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer under undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet maintains perceptual signature—“quietly explosive pressure,” “blue morpho wing remembering how to fly.” Syntax modulates: longer, breath-held clauses in observation, then short beats—“He poured more tea.” No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to dye master. Dialogue sparse, natural, sub-textual—woman’s silent laugh, child’s balloon line carry implication, not exposition.</comment>

<comment>High density: “stories gathered here the way mist pooled in hollows” does triple sensory, metaphorical, and causal work. Rhythm breathes—sentence lengths vary from 4-word pulse to 28-word mist-drifts. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; each image advances either atmosphere or concept. Metaphors stay physically coherent; “folded blue morpho wing remembering how to fly” sustains internal logic without strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The floating prayer-tethered tea-house is not mere ornament; its aerial stillness makes the wing-light refraction possible, a risk that fuses magic-realist frame to thematic inquiry. Lepidopterist-donor detail turns potential gimmick into inevitability. Fresh inflection: magnetism redefined as mutual mirroring, not charisma. Sustained conceptual commitment without explanatory collapse; specificity of dye master’s sun-tracking past anchors the metaphoric leap.</comment>
