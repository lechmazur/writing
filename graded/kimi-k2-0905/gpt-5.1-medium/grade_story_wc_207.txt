<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—rational cartographer vs. psychometric visionary—are dramatized in the compass-touch beat; his micro-choice to jar the cave-air costs him bodily fear and forecloses retreat. Interiority stays concrete (“heat flared up his arm”) and avoids label-speak. The final boat-rock crystallizes his hierarchy of wonder over safety. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: compass burn → vision → follow → boat → lagoon crossing, each step a therefore-link narrowing escape. Closure is Charged Poise: the spinning needle locking inward makes the hinge-legible cost undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One causal micro-gap—why the factory “guards” is inferred not dramatized—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Abandoned rail, chemical ditch, limestone cave, and still lagoon form a causal chain that successively constrains movement and charges the final mirror-surface. Sensory hierarchy skews to smell and touch, matching Elias’s collector bias. Spatial choreography is clean: the skiff’s rotted ribs echo factory ribs, tightening the motif. Environment directly shapes the final tactic—boat as only path—qualifying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—tightens when the compass abandons north for inward; the lagoon crossing is the visible price (risk of no return). Internal/external stakes braid: curiosity vs. bodily survival. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Cost is legible but not yet paid on-page, capping below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from scent-as-time: petrichor = buried memory, factory = sealed history, cave = pre-history. Final image of “hinge half open” reweights earlier grandmother line without moralizing. No abstract thesis stated; meaning resides in sensory echo. One notch off for faint convenience in “factory built to guard”—unearned geopolitic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Elias’s perceptual filter—metaphor choices (“teeth of a patient beast”) are his, not authorial. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten inside the tunnel. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses cleanly. Compass vision syntax shifts to paratactic chant, then snaps back—pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Only two scaffold loops (“then he… then he…”) early in descent; otherwise rhythm varies and propels. Metaphors are lean, never stacked; information density high—“jars clink softly” does triple duty: sound, fragility, obsession. No mixed metaphors at climax. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he sees… he realizes”) in vision paragraph costs −0.2, keeps below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of psychometry + petrichor-collector is fresh; the compass not as treasure-map but as time-leak feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet speculative mode pays off: no monster, just mirrored stillness. Specific detail—factory emblem on crates—grounds twist. Loses 0.1 because “hinge” metaphor nearly drifts into self-conscious profundity.</comment>
