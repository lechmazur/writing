<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured: “spatially imaginative by nature; she felt buildings as organs…”. The deleted-film metaphor externalizes her life-long question; touching the strip becomes a micro-choice that crystallizes her history of unsent letters. The “ache she felt in the seconds after saying goodbye” is embodied, not labelled. Closure—her decision to see unused love as “unfinished reels” rather than failure—stems from prior causality and carries felt relief/cost; she forgoes the old self-definition. Projectionist is thin but functional as pressure-source; main focus stays on POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of spliced-out images builds density until the booth wall shows her own deleted frames. One scene, no orientation debt; anchor (who/where/when) nailed by sentence 3. Closure is Charged Poise—she lets the cooling film re-price her past. The cost is legible: she must “let new scenes grow” without recovering the originals. Causality intact: because she touches the strip → visions → re-framed identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The booth is rendered through tactile lived detail: “dust, hot metal, slept-through matinees.” Projector as lighthouse is specific, not decorative; setting constrains her only path to answers. Rain/neon outside contrasts interior hush, sharpening tonal pressure. Spatial tracking is clean: stairwell → booth → wall for impromptu screen. Setting passes 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled sentence 1. Pressure tightens through image accumulation; no external antagonist needed. Micro-turn: realization that cut love is “not erased, only stripped from the narrative” narrows her options to acceptance or perpetual ache. Cost is visible: she abandons the hope of reclamation and takes on the labor of “new scenes.” Fits 8.8+ requirement under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from film-cut metaphor; no explicit thesis. Deleted scenes = unsent love reweights reader’s own marginal gestures. Final image answers thematic question non-literally: “unfinished reels awaiting her choice of ending.” Ambiguity embraced—she neither forgives nor forgets, only re-visions. Sentimentality avoided by mechanical specificity of sprocket holes and emulsion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is architectural (“rooms as thoughts”). Metaphor cluster is voice-driven and taught early: “rosary” of film, “lighthouse in fog,” etc. No head-hopping; projectionist’s dialogue restrained, cinematic. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences in vision trance; short declarative after “So that is where it goes.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs three jobs (anchor, sensory, metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors (“smile sounded like a reel clicking”) are deliberate synesthesia, not slips. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts hit at perception shifts. Closure line is clean, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—deleted scenes as stored unloved moments—is fresh synthesis of familiar cinema nostalgia. Micro-setting (booth) and psychometry method are specific to narrative need. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure legible. Not quite 9+ only because film-archive magic edges known tropes; still transformed through Mara's architectural lens.</comment>
