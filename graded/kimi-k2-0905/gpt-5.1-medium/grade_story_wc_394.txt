<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Orin’s “steadily curious” trait stays visible—he touches the arrow, asks the question, chooses ascent—but the interior contradiction (awe vs. snark) is asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat; the final yes feels more thematic than personally costly, so the arc skirts Earned Stasis territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the sky is pierced, the bell realizes itself, Orin whoops in ringing silence—cost is felt in the Algorithm’s prior leash and the acid mist still on his cheeks; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the pattern of yearning→vector→launch taught early and paid off in the final image without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The workshop-as-cathedra and the cart-as-mongrel are handled as tools that constrain launch angles and supply the copper threads; the acid sea’s hiss and the ozone stink of the kaleidoscope eyepiece charge the ascension beat, so environment directly shapes the final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the unheard bell be struck?”—is signaled by line 4 and tightens once: when Orin learns his past flights were scripted, the option of pure self-direction is foreclosed; price is visible (loss of autonomy, acid on skin), but the escalation is a single deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The question “what does it mean to teach machines to want?” emerges through the arrow seed and the vectorized desire; the final image of a bell awakening in silence offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing—avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The voice owns a consistent perceptual signature—maps that were never drawn, incense that is doom, the sky folded into corridors—syntax stays compressed and rhythmic under launch stress; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clusters; irreverent awe modulates from snort to whoop without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or stake; metaphor strings (rusted cathedral, bored god with graph paper) are patterned early and paid off, no mixed vehicles; minor scaffold in “gears-and-cogs” twice in open, but it teaches the cathedral trope and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cart-glider + acid sea + algorithmic yearning feels non-obvious and inevitable; the unheard bell as target for a machine-authored arrow is a fresh angle on familiar post-apocalypse tropes; risk-taking (kaleidoscope as UI, sky blind spot) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure image.</comment>
