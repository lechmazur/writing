<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The instructor’s ache for star-navigation is embodied and consistent; the anchor-chain keeps memory alive in every beat. Internal contradiction—comfort in the abyss vs. longing for open sky—drives the silent yes to Mirror’s invitation, paying the cost of sleep and safety. Micro-choices (unclasping the chain, pressing it to glass) crystallize values without diagnostic talk. The only block to 9.0: we see ache but no irrevocable tactical loss inside this single scene; the cost is atmospheric, not yet lived. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each sensory layer (pressure dome, manganese plain, alien spires) adds density until the star-edge web reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator frames sky with rusted iron, embracing a curriculum he cannot yet teach—cost is the unknown future, visible in the final image. Causality is interior but coherent: because he once navigated by stars, therefore he accepts Mirror’s lesson, therefore the chain becomes lens rather than anchor. Orientation rock-solid by line 3; no ambiguity. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Diamond blister viewport, thermal-current charts, and the chain link itself act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only through the blister can edge-geometry be seen, only the chain lets the narrator literalize the lesson. Black nodule plain and humming alien spires mirror inner absence/attraction, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ex-helmsman notices pressure, sound below hearing, starlight translated into wavelength. Detail economy perfect; nothing is tourist scenery. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the narrator re-learn navigation once north vanishes? Tightening occurs when edge-geometry replaces static star-fixes, narrowing his toolkit from certainty to gradient-sense. Protagonist agency: he could refuse the midnight lesson; instead he unclasps the chain, physically enacting commitment. Cost is legible—sleep lost, former certitudes dissolved—yet scene ends before we see this new method risk lives, so escalation is philosophical rather than visceral. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: navigation is less about destination than about choosing which absence to trust. Subtext loaded into objects—rust circle vs. star void—so final image reweights “anchor” as frame rather than ballast. No moralizing, only resonant ambiguity: will gradient-sailing save or doom cadets? The somber marvel tone sustains thematic duality without forcing a thesis. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: maritime vocabulary (“hull,” “salt,” “rigging”) collides with abyss diction (“blister,” “column,” “thermal beacon”) yielding a believable exile idiom. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for immersion, fragments at revelation (“So I went.”) to mimic descent. No head-hop; Mirror’s dialogue vibrates through metal, avoiding anthropomorphic convenience. Voice tension escalates under pressure without syntactic crumble. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“spires like frozen sound,” “tidal flowers”) are purposeful, pattern-taught early, paid off in final rigging-of-constellations image. Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs dominate. Read-aloud ear varied; no algorithmic cadence. Line clarity survives peak lyric beats. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of submarine noir with alien epistemology feels fresh yet inevitable; star-navigation as negative-space geometry reframes SF tropes. Risk taken: story stakes are philosophical, not explosive, trusting lyric accumulation to carry tension—successful. Specificity (chain link, manganese plain, thermal beacon) prevents abstraction from drifting into anywhere-setting. </comment>
