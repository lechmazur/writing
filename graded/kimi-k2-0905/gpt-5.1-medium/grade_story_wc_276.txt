<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fisher’s refusal to voice his question crystallizes a lifetime of listening translated into a single act of withheld speech; the rail-spike burn and the salt-grief on his tongue make the cost visceral. Interiority stays concrete—"every unanswered question ever flung at the sky"—and the contradiction between his habitual transliteration and final silence is dramatized, not labeled. The choice forecloses the mythic promised payoff, a credible renunciation scaled to 800 words. Small slip: “not-knowing tugged at him more sharply than hunger” drifts toward abstract hunger-cliché, blunting embodied specificity one notch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: by letting the question dissolve unsaid he rewrites the garden’s music into “new, broken rhythms,” a visible cost that re-weights the entire premise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density escalate until silence breaks the waveform; the final image re-configures meaning without causal reversals, satisfying the lens guardrail. Orientation is swift: “cool-headed fisher poled his skiff” anchors who/where/when inside 15 words. No telegraphing of stakes or abilities is violated; the grandmother whisper sets up the silence method early enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rail spike functions as micro-setting: its remembered rail-history pins the skiff and later burns his palm, constraining the final refusal. Sensory triangulation—iron cold, salt taste, mute foam—filters through the fisher’s professional attention to sound and silence, never tourist-catalog. Sky geometry is tracked cleanly: spiral shell of light forms the garden’s “throat,” spatially coherent. One hair-line slip: “water rose and fell in rippling chords” risks sonic cliché, but immediate follow-up “each crest hissed a note” re-anchors physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—tightens once: the spiral forms and silence method locks the waves, narrowing options to speak or refuse. The refusal is the single meaningful turn; cost is the echo’s grief flooding him and the garden’s rhythm breaking, visible on page. Pressure is textural, not causal; density peaks when suspended droplets wait “like a note on a staff,” then pattern fractures into new song. No secondary reversal, but one escalation suffices at this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: the price of asking versus the cost of silence—world broken into song versus world left to sing itself broken. The kneeling goddess offers “only reflection,” refusing to moralize; the reader carries the ambiguity. Subtext operates via taste of salt and burning iron—sensory rather than asserted. Final image of “new, broken rhythms” re-weights the premise without sermon, meeting CR standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet concrete: syntactic parallelism (“each crest hissed…each trough held”) teaches the wave-music pattern early and pays off in the broken rhythm finale. Perceptual signature is sonic-selective—widow’s silence becomes “chart of currents,” sailor’s laugh “tomorrow’s wind”—profession-specific diction. No head-hopping; compression like “calendar pinned to certainty” is legible within metaphoric logic. Filter verbs serve voice: “he felt every unanswered question” is justified as transliteration gift, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: “rail spike taken from a drowned track” packs history, metallurgy, and drowned rail-bed into five words. Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato “He could demand…” without algorithmic feel. One mixed-metaphor risk—“constellations…shuffling their stars like hands fumbling through dark pockets”—but physical logic holds (stars ≈ coins/pocket). No scaffold loops; paraphrase absent. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fisher who nets sound instead of fish, goddess echo as catch, and silence spoken through iron transform familiar quest-into-myth into fresh sensory logic. The “feral lullaby” tonally re-configures from lullaby to broken song, a risk that heightens rather than obscures stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable: only this man, this tool, this night of misaligned sky could yield this new music. No derivative premise penalty; sea-shattered goddess is sufficiently re-particularized.</comment>
