<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s muteness, paint-stained fingers, and final “Use me” crystallize a credible arc from proxy-artist to conduit; the embodied tremor of the flower-press key against hot brass gives visible cost. Interior contradictions—shyness vs. hunger to speak—are dramatized in the graffiti circuitry instead of label-speak. No second character on stage, so relationship bullet skipped; headcount stays coherent. The closing surrender of authorship to the wall hits as earned stasis with skin-level price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the city’s raw confessions (“I AM LONELY”) reweight every prior mural into public grammar, cost legible in the overheated bolt plate and Lio’s unvoiced throat. Causal chain: copper dust etchings → code-ghost awakened → graffiti grammar reversed → city exhales. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no disorientation debt. Lens holds as Causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Persistent constraint: once the wall speaks, Lio’s private code is permanently socialized—an irreversible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Misty courtyard above clouds functions as both stage and pressure cooker—its silver mist conducts the literal circuit and narrows perceptual field to lantern-glow and damp stone. The flower-press bolt plate evolves from conservatory relic to resonant ignition key, constraining the final interface. Spatial choreography stays clean: palm on stone, four screws, hovering petal-moths track without drift. Weather (lightning-to-thunder interval) works as live clock that forces the encode/decision before thunderclap applause.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to unspoken needs—tightens when the wall demands reciprocity, foreclosing Lio’s anonymity. Escalation is single but meaningful: the ghost flips encoder into decoder, forcing public exposure. Cost visible in hot brass and the city’s raw sentences now irretrievably externalized. No antagonist needed; pressure comes from reversed instrumentality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of outsourced voice emerges through circuitry and pigment rather than thesis lines; final graffiti confessions reweight earlier murals from secrecy to communal reliquary. Subtext runs in chalky petal-moths and the ghost’s “WE ARE YOUR UNSPOKEN LISTENERS,” implying art’s obligation to its public. No late moralizing; thunder’s applause is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity lingers: whose need is being served—city’s or artist’s?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Lio’s sensory bias—paint scent, metal warmth, mist taste—without POV leakage. Diction (“trembling breath,” “driftingly alert”) is character-specific, not generic poetic. Rhythm accelerates into short, breathy clauses during wall-reply, mirroring skipped heartbeat before thunder. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue; narrative syntax itself becomes songline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught (“lightning stitched white veins”) and paid off in thunder’s applause, so no overworld penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances circuitry or stakes. Minor filter verbs (“he felt”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Final line “tinkersong wonder” is precise coinage that fuses gears and music without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of street-art circuitry with urban ghost narrative feels non-obvious yet inevitable; copper-dust mortar as antenna is fresh world-logic. Graffiti grammar reversing into public confession reframes familiar “artist vs. audience” trope. Risk in high-wire lyric pays off: hovering petal-moths could have tipped into whimsy but are grounded by tactile chalk dust. Specific detail—conservatory bolt plate, copper dust—anchors concept in lived scavenging rather than abstract tech.</comment>
