<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ilen’s interiority is vivid—his lungs “forget how to breathe,” his laugh “scraping like a chair on concrete”—and his micro-choice to stand beneath the portico under the Voice’s command crystallizes his variant-allegiance arc. The childhood blackout memory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts his stance, satisfying BRR. Cost is felt: he realizes “the choice had probably been made years ago,” a resonant renunciation. Minor slip: the phrase “lyrically prophetic” is used meta-diagnostically without on-page dramatized cost, −0.2.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of rain-lashed cobalt glass while the Choir “argue cheerfully” reweights the stake—dawn will remember the bargain. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static density rises from “chipped teacup” through “bruised purples and feverous greens” to the storm-night aquarium. Causality is intact: Voice’s invitation → Ilen’s obedience → crystallized stance. Cost is legible in the final clause “the dawn would remember this bargain.” Hairline slip: “lyrically prophetic” is a touch outline-ish, −0.1.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observatory-as-teacup and cobalt portico function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: Ilen must physically stand beneath the glass to seal the bargain. Sensory triage under stormlight—taste of metal, sound of gravel on drums—mirrors his eroding psyche. Spatial choreography is clean: tea mug knocked over, mold pilgrims marching, rain turning panels into warped aquarium. One hairline overdraft: “bruised purples and feverous greens” edges toward palette-list, but it’s POV-filtered, forgiven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Ilen surrender his future to an unknown Voice—tightens when the Voice demands allegiance under the portico. Escalation is accumulative: signals shift from static to conversational, then to whole sentences, finally to a conditional prophecy. The portico stand is the visible price that forecloses refusal. Cost is felt, but slightly abstract (“the dawn would remember”) compared to bodily stakes earlier; keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of editing history: variant futures vote on which Ilen they want, making the self a negotiable text. Subtext operates in silence—no answer to what the Voice is—and in the mold colony’s doomed march. Final image reweights “shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows” into a debt owed to darkness. No moralizing, no thesis statement; avoids tidy equivalence between obedience and defiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly Ilen—syntax like “stormlight kept licking its rusted ribs,” perceptual skew that names static “the Choir of Rust.” Rhythmic control under pressure: the final storm-night paragraph accelerates through clause-stacking without losing clarity. No head-hopping; distance tightens from lyrical remove to skull-knuckled immediacy. A hairline echo of “lyrically prophetic” is the only near-generic phrase, but it’s framed as academy jargon, forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lightning threaded through the swollen sky below” fuses visual and kinetic in one breath. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. One mixed image—“gravel poured over drums”—is justified by sonic logic. Minor scaffold: “the word hung in the buzzing air” slightly abstracts the moment, −0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Premise—an exiled astronomer made prophet by overlapping futures arguing via radio—feels inevitable yet fresh. The Choir of Rust transforms steampunk trope into ontological electorate. Risky second-person intrusion (“HELLO, ILEN”) pays off by tightening stakes. Specificity of “dawn remembers its debts” reconfigures cosmic horror into personal accounting. No close echoes; transformation test passes—plot collapses without variant-allegiance mechanic.</comment>
