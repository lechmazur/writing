<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leila’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. yearning for belief—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing names, brushing dirt). The final renunciation of departure is visible in her “breathing as if for the first time,” but because that beat is slightly abstract we do not feel a hard cost foreclose another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds density to the orchard/bones/sundial motif until the final solar alignment crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—time restored, continuity felt—yet the cost (permanent exile from straight-line modernity) is only implied, not nailed to the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is a living pressure system: roots clasp skulls, soil destabilizes the trench, saplings stake future graves. The sundial’s gnomen shadow literally touches the bronze pointer at climax, so object + environment jointly constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can interrupted journeys ever loop back into meaning?—tightens when collapsing trench wall exposes the 360° calendar, forcing communal decision to rebuild. Cost is visible: desecration risk, priest’s blessing bought with shared authorship, Leila forfeits observer neutrality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as cyclical vs. linear time; “interrupted journeys” re-weighted into circular continuity. Subtext in silent orchard listening and collective breath avoids overt thesis; final image of circle-not-line lands resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Leila, filtering every image through diaspora-eyed estrangement (“air smelled… of something older she could not yet name”). Syntax grows longer under enchantment, contracts during trench collapse, teaching pattern; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse action + metaphor (“apple trunks…cursive prayers”). Occasional soft paraphrase (“journey… severed line”) loops earlier phrasing but does not stall climax; sensory nouns strong, scaffold minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing archaeology with living orchard-sundial-calendar feels fresh; risk of landscaping-the-dead is openly admitted, not hedged. Specificity of cracked jars, seed-pit ring, and ancestor songs prevents trope drift.</comment>
