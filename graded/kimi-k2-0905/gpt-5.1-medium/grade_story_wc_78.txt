<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aera’s interiority is concrete and embodied—bare feet on brine-soaked planks, the mallet’s weight in her palm. The “obstacles into instruments” credo is dramatized, not declared, through her percussive commands that literally retune the orchard. Cost is visible: fear stays a bass note under the new harmony, and her smile at the end carries the residue of every wave she just dared. Only the grandmother flashback feels slightly abstract, blunting the full bite of generational trauma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each strike layers resonance until the orchard’s physical balance and future paths audibly shift. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aera’s leeward smile—where cost is felt in the still-ringing deck and the tomorrow already humming. One causal micro-turn (shift casks starboard) converts acoustic knowledge into physical salvation, tightening stakes without causal gaps. Orientation is secure by line 5; driftwood circle, blue hour, tide-prophet role are anchor enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: salt-roped timbers groan in chord progressions, blossoms become percussive shrapnel, tide-casks double as bass drums. Micro-setting (body, mallet, mast) constrains every tactic—Aera can only act by sounding what her hands can reach. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis logic: wind roar first, brine-sweet petals second, cloud cartography last. Spatial choreography survives the tilting deck; distances remain legible as children cling to trunk-rails and ballast stones answer back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the orchard afloat—tightens when the largest swell slews them leeward and paths “snarled together.” Aera’s dub-driven command reweights the physical layout, turning noise into stabilizing rhythm; the price is the persistent bass-note fear that remains audible under the new sway. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of sound and motion increases until the platform finds syncopation with the sea. One visible forfeiture—blossoms sacrificed to wind—marks the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the acoustic metaphor: order is not imposed but listened into being. The orchard’s shift from cacophony to “restless euphony” reconfigures the meaning of fear itself—no longer erased but carried as rhythm. No character articulates a thesis; the final smile is an image of acceptance that reweights earlier dissonance. Ambiguity lingers: tomorrow’s hum could be promise or next threat, keeping the moral un-tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Aera’s perceptual signature—clouds as charcoal strokes, ropes as cello strings—without poetic overreach. Sentence rhythm mirrors wave pulse: longer swells of imagery broken by single-beat commands (“Move the casks starboard”). No head-hopping; children’s panic is filtered through the mast’s vibration she feels underfoot. Register stays inside a sailor-poet diction credible for a tide-prophet who thinks in sound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear rewards varied sentence openings andclause lengths that mimic sea-surge without falling into template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent: “brine-sweet petals” is precise, not purple. One mixed metaphor—“paths snarled together like knotted rigging”—is justified because rigging is literal environment. Information density high: one sentence can do setting, sensory tilt, and foreshadow (“apples clacking like teeth”). No scaffold or synonym loops; each noun earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The maritime orchard tuned by percussion is a fresh synthesis; none of the tropes—floating village, weather prophet, found music—feel recycled once welded here. Fractal forecasting via xylophone strikes transforms a gnomic prompt rule into lived physics. Risky second-person echo (“Dub the world until it answers”) pays off by becoming Aera’s inherited battle cry. Specificity of sound-as-map makes the concept impossible to transplant to another setting unchanged.</comment>
