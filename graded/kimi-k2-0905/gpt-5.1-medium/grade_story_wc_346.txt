<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The adjuster’s contradictory motives—to keep the child’s relic yet still act—are palpable in the puppet’s placement, but his interiority sometimes drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“he understood then…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (speaking the sequence, palm on glass) are present and costly, yet the pivot from global saviour to lullaby-whisperer is asserted more than dramatized. Relationships are memory-only, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are N/A; the reflection % is high but within the allowed ceiling and anchored to present stimuli. The arc lands as credible renunciation, but the emotional cost is more declared than corporeally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causality holds: broken puppet → mechanism shudder → chamber walk → clock fade forms a clean because/therefore chain. The lighthouse door “sequence of years” seed pays off the early disorientation, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world still burns but some rooms stay intact, with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world did not end all at once”). One minor slack: the “nested patterns” mechanic is taught only by metaphor, not demonstrated until the corridor walk; still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is legible and held to the final dimming.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Environment is vividly selective—brine, dust, halted-storms metal—yet stays tactile (door resists hand, shelves carved). The broken puppet itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when the key should have waited. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean in a single room. The lighthouse and clock charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. One hairline slip: “pane of hush” is used twice without a physical referent the second time, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to halt or soften doom—signals early and tightens when the puppet substitution visibly forecloses the master-key path. Escalation is textural: each chamber deepens the cost of tenderness withheld, reweighting the stake rather than reversing plot direction. The price is felt in the bruised awe of the final line. No off-stage rescue; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the value of small mercies over grand salvation—emerges through the corridor of forgiven cruelties rather than exposition. Subtext hums in the cracked puppet smile versus the clock’s blank metal. The ending image (“world did not end all at once”) reweights the premise without moralizing. One faint sermon-line—“he had come for something quieter, harder”—is cushioned by immediate visceral action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent perceptual signature: mist “like breath that had forgotten its owner,” time “thrumming like a trapped bird.” Syntax modulates from long liquid coils to fragment-cut beats under pressure. No dialogue, so those bullets N/A. POV distance remains stable; abstraction is patterned early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm is organic, with purposeful breath-length variation; no algorithmic cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned (light/time/breath) and never clutters causality. One paraphrase glitch—“nested patterns like questions nested within regret”—is a near-loop but occurs mid-text, not at closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; pronoun tracking clean in a single-character scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mythic apocalypse + broken toy = fresh synthesis; the puppet-as-key twist feels inevitable post-fact. Lyric mosaic structure is taught by dusk arrival and pays off in chambered walk. Risk—halting armageddon with a cracked doll head—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor derivative echo: “one minute to midnight” is familiar, but reweighted by the lullaby payoff.</comment>
