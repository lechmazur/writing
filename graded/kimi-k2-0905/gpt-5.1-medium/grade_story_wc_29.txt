<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s rigor vs. trickster-hunter thrill—is dramatized in micro-choices (dial twist, slider nudge, apology to gear). Embodied cost arrives when she risks the station’s license and her own anonymity by feeding the debate into the Void. The “gambler setting the table” moment crystallizes earned change; tricksters’ answering swell confirms she’s no longer pawn. Flaw: cautious-hope trait is named more than embodied in final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tower sale → signal shift → Mara’s subsonic counter-move → audible reply. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: campus discord is re-broadcast as cosmic invitation, cost felt when window glass rattles—military encryption now looms larger. One transition (studio→ceiling debate) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. No meaningful escalation break; tightening occurs at subsonic patch moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Radio tower as tuning fork, rusted guy-wires thrumming in teeth, and sub-bass snakes in monitors give tactile specificity that constrains Mara’s technical choices. Astronomical charts glow under exit light, becoming literal map for her incantation-script—object charges final image. Acoustic tiles raining dust bridge upstairs debate to downstairs sabotage. Selector knob, slider, and patch bay function as micro-setting that enables the climactic interference.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the Void playful and student-accessible—tightens when defense contractor looms. Escalation is causal: each human fracture (senate vote, on-air debate) correlates with signal mutation, forcing Mara’s counter-move. Subsonic broadcast is visible price: she jeopardizes FCC compliance and personal safety. No coincidence; tension narrows to single question—will tricksters accept her invitation instead of vanishing into classified spectrum?</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: spectral sovereignty vs. commodified spectrum; mischief as communal resistance. No explicit thesis; final image of sky swelling in reply reweights earlier “radio ink” metaphor—contracts now subject to cosmic revision. Ethereal grit tone sustains ambiguity: student idealism is neither mocked nor sanctified. Subtle counter-reading: Mara’s gambit may merely relocate exploitation to a larger stage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: technical synesthesia—“signal greeted her like always, a shimmer underneath the static, almost polite”—anchors POV. Compression and elliptical syntax (“She rewrote phrases…aligning verbs with right ascensions”) taught early and paid off in incantation beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under console glow. Diction stays within student-engineer lexicon; rhythmic variation mirrors rising sub-bass pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “budget meetings” compressed into “radio ink”; single sentence fuses playlist cut, angry text, studio roar. Metaphors are disciplined—no mixed vehicles—and serve character perception. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at patch toggle, then releases with “long, low swell.” Minor scaffold: “like always” + “almost polite” is faint paraphrase but does not touch closure. No filter-verb clusters or thesaurus churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of campus-politics thriller and cosmic-signal SF feels fresh yet inevitable. Trickster-cosplay premise is grounded in concrete radio-engineering procedure, avoiding abstraction. Risk of subsonic counter-broadcast heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail—charts glowing under exit light, SUB BASS knob—renders template unrecognizable; removal would collapse plot logic.</comment>
