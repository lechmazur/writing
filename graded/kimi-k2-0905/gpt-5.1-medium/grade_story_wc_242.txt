<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s “cultivated estrangement” is dramatized through the glass-disc ritual and her refusal to join topside life; the interior contradiction—loner who needs strangers—drives every beat. Her micro-choice to keep Mara on the line is earned by years of wrong-number friendships shown in compressed flashback. The cost is legible: she stays alone in the tunnel, spinning silence back into the dark. Only the final beat drifts toward soft epiphany-speak (“narrow, echoing bridge”) that slightly blurs the embodied price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara rewrites her loop by dialing her sister; Lena’s price is renewed exile. Causal chain holds—glass tone → instruction → streetlamp fade → new dial—with no soft resets. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; the single-scene default is met. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through lyrical density until the final cadence reweights the stake of endless loops.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concrete throat, rusted gate, dripping dark—tunnel details are filtered through Lena’s professional attention and shape her acoustic ritual. The glass disc functions as micro-setting: its icy sound literalizes “haunted” and enables the coaching beat. Spatial choreography is clean—receiver cord, shelf, alcove—no floating bodies. Final image of tunnel-as-bridge reconfigures place from trap to conduit, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loops must be broken—signals on page 1. Escalation is textural: each echoed phrase (“hum of streetlamps”) tightens the noose around Mara’s decision. Agency sits with Lena’s risky instruction; the lamp’s fade supplies external pressure. Cost is visible: Mara walks away, Lena remains in dim throat—option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—endings can be retuned—emerges from the glass-tone metaphor and the relay of wrong-number confessions, never sermonized. Subtext lives in silences, traffic hiss, the lamp’s stutter. Final image reprises tunnel-as-vein/bridge, reweighting estrangement as conduit, not void. Ambiguity is preserved: Lena’s own loop continues, unpaid.</comment>

<comment>Fused narrator-operator voice: syntax contracts around relays and hums, diction stays technician-cold (“rotary switchboard,” “neutral script”). Glass disc gives tactile rhythm; damp fingertip stroke beats like a pulse in pressured lines. No dialogue bloat; Mara's voice carries river-wind grain without head-hopping. Compression taught early (“Lena unlocked…”) pays off in final stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long sentence opens, shortens under call pressure, lengthens again into ebb. No synonym churn; “electric pause,” “concrete throat” are specific, not purple. Only micro-loop is “hum of streetlamps” echo—functional, pattern-taught. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Subway phone-booth operator is fresh premise; wrong-number therapy loop is specific twist on crisis-line trope. Glass harmonica as tuning fork for choices is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric density over plot—pays off in charged final image. Could swap city name, but operator + harmonica + tunnel is inseparable bundle.</comment>
