<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Noah’s contradictory dread of metal tunnels (contrasted with honest rock) and his simultaneous need “to stand by the unremembered” create a live interior fracture. The moment he pockets the gold-flecked codex, both motives collide—greed/curiosity versus reverence—pushing him deeper instead of back to safety. The claustrophobic panic is fleshed through breath, visor flash, negative-mass sphere, not labels. Only missing a sharper cost-on-page at the final beat (he “turned” but panic and conscience are not re-weighed in one embodied beat), capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Noah’s choice to leave with the humming sphere is crystallized in the last clause “whispering of return,” a Charged Poise that forecloses leaving the past sealed. Causal linkage holds: gold fleck → sphere → temporal drift warning → renunciation of full escape. The orientation anchors (who/when/where) hit by line 3; facility purpose and tide clock are clear before 120 words. Cost is felt: four-hour window already shrinking, sphere’s “negative mass” promises future toll; lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-as-sleeping-beast, rust flakes “choking” stairwell, cables “arterial undersea links” supply tactile specificity that mirrors Noah’s rising dread. The sphere-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: its “almost negative” mass reweights the entire mission. Spatial choreography is flawless: hatch → corridor → archive → core lab, each step narrowing ceiling height and options. No object drifts or impossible positions; environment directly guides his descending route and compounds claustrophobia.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape within tide window versus staying with remembered voices—tightens when rig flashes “temporal drift approaching.” Meaningful turn: choosing to carry the soul-net sphere out forecloses clean exit and invites undefined coast. Cost is visible on-page: sphere’s anti-gravity tug and client-obscured agenda ensure future peril; tide clock is live constraint. Pressure escalates via because/therefore chain (codex clue → deeper descent → drift alert) under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges from the sphere capturing “unnoticed thoughts,” gold codex margin, and Noah’s self-named duty to the “unremembered.” Subtext carried in gesture: pocketing the ruined codex and lifting the weightless sphere silently trade reverence for commodification. Final image re-weights premise—salvage becomes trafficking of souls—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: client motives, sphere aftermath, Noah’s complicity all unresolved but thematically charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice marries caver’s tactile lexicon (“tightest throats,” “salt damp”) to lyrical compression (“world’s amnesia,” “crashing hush”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Noah notices space, pressure, honesty of materials; metaphors are subterranean or maritime. Syntax flexes with stress—short clauses as ceilings press closer; no head-hopping. If a single quibble, “negative mass” feels one notch toward explanatory register amid otherwise sensory diction, preventing full 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control: opening spondaic beat (“The sea above…”) teaches cadence that recurs in softer wave-crashes. Sentences layer job-density—each advances exterior action, interior panic, and world lore simultaneously. Metaphors stay physically coherent (sea pillow, arterial cables). Minor filler: “told himself he was only here for the payday” could compress, but overall momentum never stalls; no loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combines cave-diving thriller, drowned cold-war listening post, and metaphysical soul-harvest into a seamless, fresh alloy. Quantum “phase transition” soul-net built from marginal gold ink is novel yet internally rigged. Risk of abstraction is conquered by concrete bodily stakes (claustrophobia, tide clock). The takeaway image—weightless sphere murmuring return—feels inevitable yet wholly new; no pop-culture echo. Concept and character mutually invent each other.</comment>
