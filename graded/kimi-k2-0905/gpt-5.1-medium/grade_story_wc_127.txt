<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eve’s interior contradiction—needing clarity yet craving empathy—drives every beat; the static-sense is embodied in “crackling halos” and copper tang, not labeled. Her micro-choice to accept the blotter-petal reconfigures her professional identity with visible cost: “you may not like the person who walks back out.” Dealer’s affectionate detachment and copper-wired wrists make him a believable catalyst, not a cipher. No stock therapy-speak; even “calibrated empathy” is immediately re-defined as counterfeit that glows, keeping diagnostic language at arm’s length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: amber density, static charge, and bottled moods keep thickening until the final image of “scaffolds to climb.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the half-truth empathy is now inside her, re-weighting future verdicts; cost is felt in the ominous warning she has already accepted. Causality holds: because she inhales the counterfeit, therefore her static arranges into readable patterns—an irreversible perceptual shift. No orientation debt; grotto, dusk, and roles are anchored within first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber grotto is not backdrop but dielectric: honeyed sorrow light refracts perception, copper shelves ground the static field, and the blotter-petal acts as wick and electrode. Sensory triangulation—resin glow, copper tang, burnt-sugar scent—mirrors Eve’s synesthetic static, fusing setting to body. Spatial choreography stays clean: dealer on crate, shelves growing from stone, Eve’s palm opening to receive the petal. Final image of “scaffolds to climb” re-uses the grotto’s golden ribs as metaphor, charging the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Eve audit without losing herself—tightens when the dealer warns her identity may survive only as question. escalates through sensory density: each vial she passes increases the static hum until the ampoule breaks and patterns lock into place. no external antagonist needed; pressure is perceptual overload and ethical self-risk. cost is paid on-page: certainties subsumed, persona potentially forfeited—an earned stasis under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the counterfeit conceit: half-truths are not moral failing but necessary scaffolding for empathy. final re-pricing flips courtroom granite ideal into mutable amber—truth as captured insect, not monolith. no explicit moral; insight crystallizes in image of “constellations emerge from scattered stars,” inviting reader to re-weight prior material. affectionate detachment tone keeps sentimentality at bay, letting ambiguity linger without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries synesthetic perceptual signature—tasting terror, hearing light—sustained across every sentence. syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as static intensifies, mirroring neural overload. diction stays within plausible auditor lexicon yet coins fresh metaphors: “syrupy, honeyed sorrow,” “brittle pride… sharp as bitten glass.” no filter-verb stacks; immediacy remains unfiltered. dealer’s dialogue distinctively rhythmic, almost baroque, separating his cadence from Eve’s analytical interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “light from fossilized resin seeped through the stone ribs overhead, staining every face with a syrupy, honeyed sorrow” embeds setting, atmosphere, and emotional filter in one sweep. no paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the counterfeit motif without contradiction. rhythm modulates: languid opening clauses give way to staccato sensory bursts as empathy floods in. closure line “scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage” lands clean, no mixed metaphor, recharging entire piece.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Counterfeit-emotion black market feels freshly specific: copper-wired wrists, bottled Consolation in bulk, blotter-petal as delivery device—none borrowed from existing canon. static-sense as audit tool transforms mundane synesthesia into plot engine, not quirky overlay. theme that half-truths are pragmatic currency rather than ethical lapse offers non-obvious moral calculus. risk-taking structure—single scene, no physical violence—relies on perceptual stakes and still delivers charged poise, proving ingenuity can trump spectacle.</comment>
