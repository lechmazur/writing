<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s fear of smell and his micro-choice to switch on Aron’s lamp are specific and embodied; the tears he finally sheds feel earned. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted emergency room disinfectant beneath phantom greenhouse humidity”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair. Still, the refusal to turn away lands as credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias lets the wave hit, crystallizing a before/after stance with ultraviolet-lit tears as felt cost. Causal chain holds—Mara’s vial → scent → lamp → memory → tears—each beat tightening options under the Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (aromatic caution) shapes every tactic until foregone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stall’s “crystal shadows” and the UV lamp’s “trapped bees” hum are tactile and selective; the cracked lantern constrains the final choice by demanding attention. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene. Micro-setting (the vial, the lamp) charges the closing image. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail is filtered through Elias’s risk calculus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias risk smelling grief?—is signaled early and tightens once: the scent surges, he flicks on the lamp, option to retreat vanishes. Cost is legible in on-page tears and the seed cracking in Mara's charm. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Causal lens. Escalation is driven by his agency; coincidence complicates only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme—memory’s scent as both wound and seed—emerges through image, not statement: tears feed a dormant seed into life. Subtext lives in gesture: condensation on cheekbones, lantern pulsing like a heartbeat. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers as “tomorrow gather, tentative but possible.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction (“scentwisped,” “pollen lantern”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Rhythm accelerates with stacked clauses as scent hits, then breathes with tears. No dialogue requires voice distinction; narrative voice modulates with pressure. UV lamp’s “buzzing like trapped bees” is sensory, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light as writing, tears as stars—paid off in closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop (“lanterns trembling...lanterns dimmed”) is minor and does not touch the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Bottled light” and “aromatically cautious” broker fuse fresh speculative angles with intimate grief. The extinct-plants greenhouse and fossilized pollen scent feel particular, not quirky ornament. Risk—letting smell kill or heal—drives every beat. Without these exact elements the emotional reconfiguration collapses; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
