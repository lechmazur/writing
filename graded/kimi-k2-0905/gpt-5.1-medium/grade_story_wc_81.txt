<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—obedient indexer vs. truth-hunter—drives every micro-choice; the colder stamp, the broken shelf-sequence, the decision to snap the kelp-ribbon all embody her trait. Emotions stay embodied (fingers on “reluctant lips” of pages) rather than labeled. The final renunciation—she will pursue the unapproved past even without council sanction—costs her the safety of civic myth; the choice is fully earned by prior causal beats. Only minor hedge: we get no second character to test status dynamics, but the solo POV remains coherent and pressurized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear: blackout → stillness → Mara’s dawning recognition of curated gaps → deliberate rupture of the hidden folio → decision to act. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 50 words and payoff is the blackout’s velvet silence that enables her theft of truth. Closure is a decisive conceptual change: the library’s official history is now irreparably undermined inside her; cost is the audible hush of complicity she now carries. One micro-turn—stamp colder—tightens rather than reverses, satisfying the single-turn allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (drowned towers pressing windows, mineral-stained aisle) literally buckles under the same hydrostatic pressure Mara now applies to official narrative. The library’s “papery hush” and the brass lantern’s stubborn star constrain visibility and timing—she can search only within its wick-span. Final image of the crude imitation stamp reweights the setting itself as co-conspirator: the building once smuggled in the forbidden folio. Setting never drifts into postcard; every shelf-gap is noticed because it blocks her indexing path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the erased hillside voices will stay silenced—is signaled in paragraph eight. Escalation is steady: each missing shelf-cluster raises the probability of deliberate curation, tightening Mara’s options to complicity or exposure. The snapped kelp-ribbon is the visible price—she irreversibly vandalizes collection integrity to reach truth. Cost is legible: she forfeits her status as neutral indexer and accepts outsider exile implied by “beyond her depth.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of absences rather than lecture: what the sea ‘did not yet chew’ is what the city first chose not to save. Subtext operates in gesture—the blank date space on the forged stamp is the unspoken civic lie. Final image re-prices the meaning of “origin” itself: no longer ledger date but the moment silence was chosen. No moralizing sentence closes the piece; resonance lingers in the oily shimmer of almost-lost ink.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: Mara reads spines “the way other people read faces,” catalogs by memory, feels pages “stick together like reluctant lips.” Syntax stays controlled and marine-tinged: “velvet over rust,” “kelp-thread,” “water held respectfully still.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under lantern-limit but never fragments. Voice sustains pressure without syntactic monotony or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Figurative language is selective—no mixed-metaphor clutter—and metaphors serve causality (tides vs. civic pressure). Minor scaffold: two adjectives in “faint, papery hush” could trim to one, and “reclaimed stillness flooded” is nearly self-repetition of “stillness flooded,” but these are hairline. Overall rhythm breathes with scene needs and closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Submerged-city library with indexer-detective is fresh synthesis; trope of hidden testimonies is re-animated through hydrostatic specificity. Risk of lyric overwriting is courted but earned—watery silence becomes investigative tool rather than atmospheric garnish. Transformation test fails if relocated to dry land: pressure physics and aquatic hush are integral to how truth is smuggled. Concept commits fully, no retreat into generic dystopia.</comment>
