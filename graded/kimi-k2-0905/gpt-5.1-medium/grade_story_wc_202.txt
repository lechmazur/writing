<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivation—“to honor overlooked histories”—is declared early and re-anchored in the guilt-shame beat near the end; the interior contradiction between professional detachment and moral debt is felt, not label-stated. However, no external pressure forces a live choice in-scene; the painter-alchemist is more oracle than antagonist, so the micro-choice that should crystallize cost is off-loaded onto later, off-page use of the shard. The “promise weight” of the shard lands, but the stance shift is prospective, not enacted here.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of images builds until the lighthouse shard drops as a pattern-break that re-weights the stake. Causality stays internal—each canvas detail is a because/therefore of attention, not plot—but the final image of closed fist + city lights below delivers a Charged Poise with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is taught lyrically from line 1 (“silver spine”) and waived when the payoff arrives; no ambiguity at closure. The missing live option-foreclosure keeps it shy of 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s nervous system: the swaying planks, brass alembics, and breathing pigments are not backdrop but tools that teach the narrator how to read silences. The lighthouse shard itself becomes micro-setting in the final beat, bending light and meaning in the palm—this constraint on future action charges the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean despite dream logic; every dangling frame and night-wind eddy is tracked. Only the city below remains a postcard blur, but that distance is thematic, not error.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“let overlooked histories speak”—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accretion of visual evidence rather than external threat. The shard’s fall is the single decisive intensification, turning abstract guilt into tactile responsibility; cost is legible in the sudden weight against skin. No live trade-off is forced in-scene, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—acceptable under Accumulative lens but capping the upper band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from recurring light/refraction imagery: translation as refraction, lens as conscience, frame as exclusion. No character moralizes; the final image of the fragment bending unseen light back into the beam offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity is purposeful—no prescription on how to wield the shard—yet the emotional after-effect of complicity is unmistakable. One minor echo of prompt language (“anchors of intuition”) costs −0.2 but is embedded in painter’s speech, not narrator summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and internally consistent: long vowel chains (“elusively tangible sound, as if it were made of warm breath and faint coins”) create a hush that matches the eternal-instant tone. Perceptual signature is strong—translator notices scuffed boots and cracked tiles before faces. No head-hopping; painter’s idiom is distinct yet stays subordinate to narrator’s filter. Rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter declaratives when shard drops (“Keep it, the painter alchemist murmured, and listen”) after lusher catalogic sentences—control under peak stress is near-flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet lucid; metaphors are coherent within light/refraction through-line, no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often handles atmosphere, backstory, and foreshadowing (“Between childhood and now, the market had waited…”). Two near-adjacent “as if” clauses are the only scaffold trace, too minor to ding. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy marketplace is familiar turf, but the alchemical frame-exchange for silenced histories feels fresh; the shard-as-keepsake converts souvenir trope into ethical prosthesis. Risk is taken with lyric disorientation early, yet pattern is taught and closure repays. Specificity of “pigments ground from forgotten sunsets” and “condensed dusk” on fingertips rescues concept from abstraction. Not quite 9 because the core mechanism—hidden painting details—remains more asserted than demonstrated in-scene.</comment>
