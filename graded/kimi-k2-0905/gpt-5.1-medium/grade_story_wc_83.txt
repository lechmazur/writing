<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s survivor-guilt and need for control are rendered in scalpel-sharp interiority (“I wanted my hand on the tilt of its descent”). The crystal-as-talisman object-choice is embodied, contradictory, and escalates to the final repair-nudge. Flaw: the leap from passive watching to active rerouting is slightly under-causal; one more micro-choice mid-text would have pushed 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic of shards is taught by 25% and resolves to a clean Conceptual Repricing: the vortex over the village reweights “unused potential” from abstract to stolen lives. The causality chain (observe anomaly → geode ache → model reroute) lands with undeniable cost on the page. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Floating observatory dragged its shadow across the ruined desert like a question mark” immediately anchors who/where/scale. Micro-setting (geode in pocket) constrains the final moral choice—repair vs ruin—charging the closure image. Sensory economy favors irradiated light, engine hum, violet teeth: all POV-filtered, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“see the machinery with no filter” versus complicity in future murder—tightens when the vortex parks over his own crater. One meaningful deepening: realizing the anomaly is not future violence but past stolen futures. Cost is conceptual (guilt made legible) rather than external; a visible forfeiture would have nudged 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organico-metallic: predictive murder-machines trained on human potential. Final image re-answers the opening question-mark shadow with a triangle of absence—no births, no transactions, no pings—making the moral cost undeniable. No moralizing sentence; the insight is charged into the model’s reroute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, drone-cold yet emotionally pressurized: “bleak exhilaration is the only honest phrase”. Syntax mirrors orbital mechanics—long drift-clauses, then sudden torque-line kinks. No head-hop; diction stays inside ex-physicist lexicon (“perturbation theory, basin of possibility”). Metaphor engine sustains without over-loading: “violet teeth” “probability clouds shimmer and tilt”.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or concept (“Every perturbation is a small echo of the blast…”). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary from one-line punches to longer orbital sweeps. One mixed-metor stretch (“question mark that never closed” adjacent “bleeding constellations”) is hairline; it does not obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses drone-revenge-survivor with quantum futures-trading; the stolen-potential vortex feels inevitable yet unexampled in published fiction. Risk: lyric density could have tipped into purple, but restraint keeps it cold-wire precise. Transformation test fails—this plot could only occur with this geode, this crater, this orbital guilt.</comment>
