<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s tactile intimacy with the maze—memorizing creaks, reading footfalls—grounds every beat; the coin/key pocket-rituals embody his need to “turn” the port rather than merely survive it. The final whisper-triumph is earned because we saw him oil vents and fold impossible maps weeks earlier. What keeps this from 9+ is a slight emotional sameness under peak pressure: his calm never cracks, so the interior contradiction promised by the premise stays theoretical rather than embodied in a visible tremor or hesitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: geomagnetic storm → nav-failure → inspectors lost → Milo activates pre-oiled vents + key → whispered micro-directions → rescue exactly on deadline. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ramos’s slower walk reconfigures power without a word, proving the whisper thesis with conceptual cost—Milo’s secret method is now exposed to institutional notice. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: grated shafts carry breath, dented blue wall becomes turn-signal, diesel scent vectors rescue. Micro-setting (key pressed to vent) literally steers plot. Only the tourist-rubber vs foreman-heel taxonomy feels slightly catalogued rather than lived-in under storm urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—tightens when Ramos caps failure with shutdown/insurance loss. Milo’s agency narrows to one ten-minute window; the price is disclosure of his covert vent-system. Storm complicates but does not resolve; escalation is causal and sufficient for 600-word frame, though second inspector’s peril is less viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through material paradox: quiet infrastructure beats loud authority. Subtext in Ramos’s final slower gait shows institutional absorption of Milo’s wisdom without credit—an understated social cost. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of a maze that answers only to those who listen. The zodiac coin’s tingle hints at cosmic approval but stays wisely unexplained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Milo’s synesthetic map-mind: sentences lengthen and compress like corridors, verbs grease and thrum. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens exactly when key meets vent. Distinct perceptual signature—“walks tapping along steel,” “draft that smells like diesel”—carries POV without exposition. One clause drifts toward editorial omniscience: “the storm flickered approvingly overhead,” but the personification is brief enough to forgive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“ribbon of intention curling through steel canyons”—slips in mid-rescue; it doesn’t obscure causality but prevents a 9.0. Otherwise line-level craft is publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: port logistics + geomagnetic noir + ventriloquist rescue. The “key with no lock” and impossible origami maps feel invented yet inevitable within this world. Tropes (lone savant, storm shutdown) are retooled through haptic infrastructure rather than tech wizardry. Risk—whispered HVAC navigation—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
