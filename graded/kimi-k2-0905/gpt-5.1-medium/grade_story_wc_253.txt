<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The performer's interior contradiction—State Joy Amplifier smuggling grief-acceptance—is vivid, but Mara's passivity flattens the crucible; her only micro-choice is compliant placement of the wooden figure, so the relationship under pressure never forces a mutual state-change. Embodied emotion (cooling tea, chipped mug) is specific, yet Mara's numbness stays summarized, not contradicted in scene. Earned shift lands in the performer, not Mara, so cost is felt asymmetrically. Still, the wooden hybrid as remade hush externalizes flaw and motive cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wooden figure crystallizes a clandestine new silence inside the surveillance grid—conceptual cost legible in “remade hush.” Causality holds: spoon-as-rebellion seeds the aesthetic, whittling enacts it, bouquet receives the contraband. Orientation anchors by line 4; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of tactile objects (shavings, tea, pine) reweights the stake rather than because/therefore turns. One soft spot: Mara's absence of choice weakens the two-sided Before/After legibility.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadows sliding across cracked yard, and the chipped mug form a micro-setting triad that constrains mood and stealth. Wooden figure's hollow center recharges the same visual grammar as the bouquet, letting setting evolve into prop. Surveillance sensors under blades appear late but pay off by reframing the room as panopticon, so environment directly shapes the performer’s tactic of “narrative texture” camouflage. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile wood curls and cooling ceramic over visual vista—economy achieved.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicit permission to grieve—tightens once: refusal to joke shifts to sculpting silence, narrowing options from verbal to tactile subversion. Agency resides solely with performer; Mara’s complicity is passive, so pressure feels one-sided. Cost is visible in surveillance risk and the wooden figure’s rough fragility, but because Mara doesn’t stake her own safety, escalation plateaus mid-range. Still, the single meaningful shift satisfies length-scale requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as stealth compassion within tyrannical cheer; no character articulates a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: spoon stirring “counterclockwise into rebellion” and the hybrid turbine-flower carving reprice “brightness” as noise. Bouquet’s dried lifelessness versus fresh pine offers understated irony about state-mandated preservation of feeling. Final image invites reflection on illegal interior quiet without sermon—ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to performer’s theatrical idiom: “heroic reduction of unnecessary volume” maintains patterned diction without filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature notices shadows sliding, wood falling “like pale petals,” aligning metaphors with vocation. Mara’s flat dialogue (“What are you doing, actually”) contrasts via syntax, achieving minimal voice distinction. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under turbine drone, mirroring compression of permissible feeling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long clause sets scene, then short chip-fall sentences mimic carving cadence. Information density high—one sentence often layers task, metaphor, and world rule (“spoon… sworn to stir the universe… into rebellion”). No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“brightness was regulated, measured in smiles per hour”) but serves world rule exposition and is forgiven. Metaphors stay coherent within mechanical-flower lattice; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands clean, recharging “remade hush.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-surveillance with grief prohibition—fresh, yet anchored in tactile miniatures rather than abstract dystopia. Wooden turbine-flower hybrid reconfigures familiar eco-imagery into contraband talisman, passing transformation test. Risk: narrating mundane acts as epic could read as twee, but consistency of performer’s vocation justifies frame. Specificity of “smiles per hour” bureaucratic metric keeps satire grounded, avoiding generic dystopia gloss.</comment>
