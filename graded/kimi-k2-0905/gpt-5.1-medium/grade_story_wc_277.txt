<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—inheritance loyalty vs. public exposure—are alive in scene; the rosewood nib squeeze externalizes the cost of her decision. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak. Micro-choice to “print against family” is earned by the prior causal chain; refusal of silence carries visible social cost. Only minor slip: father’s remembered voice is briefly generic, not specific enough to wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens options—documents arrive → revelation of emotional surveillance → proof by contradiction → decision to publish—so silence becomes untenable. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: family name will burn, ink will thunder. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. One taut deepening beat inside the observatory suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Observatory glass-limbed above cloud-sea is not postcard; it supplies the literal downward angle that enables Orpheus and the final “aim down today” choice, so environment constrains tactics. Micro-setting rosewood nib re-weights from heritage weapon to gavel in her grip, charging the last image. Selective sensory hierarchy—metallic sigh, murmuring gray—mirrors Elena’s narrowed attention under pressure. Weather and altitude remain causally present throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—public truth vs. family complicity—signaled on first page; escalation delivered in one sharp tightening once documents prove emotional surveillance. Protagonist agency drives the irreversible choice to publish; cost is printed city-wide shame. No coincidence resolves; pressure coils under causal lens. One meaningful turn satisfies short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: information as liberation vs. information as cage. Subtext lives in telescope angles that look down, not up, and in the nib once used for apologies now signing betrayal. Final image—presses thunder, city sees its reflection—reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: liberation may still be a different cage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is architectural, financial, metaphoric—“glass-limbed lighthouse,” “orbit of regret.” Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, staccato for proof steps. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elena’s elite lexicon. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Tariq’s clipped urgency vs. her philosophical play.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description plus metaphor that advances concept. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled: one sustained Orpheus/observatory orbit metaphor that pays off. Strong verbs (“swallowing,” “spikes,” “thunder”) replace modifiers. Only hairline slip: “information should set people free” edges toward aphorism, but immediately undercut by next line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Emotional-surveillance satellite network sold to media/police is fresh extrapolation of existing tech, made specific through newspaper dynastic guilt. Proof-by-contradiction as activist method is a non-obvious tactical frame. Risk taken: no scene of actual printing, yet closure still lands via conceptual repricing. Transformation test fails if names change—inheritance and observatory are irreplaceable.</comment>
