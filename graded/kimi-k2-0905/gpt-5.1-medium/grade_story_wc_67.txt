<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is sharply etched through ash-scatter choreography and the grandmother-proxy mask; the renunciation of “safety” is embodied, not declared. The micro-choice to release the final ash visibly costs her the illusion of control, earning the Earned Stasis. Grandmother’s mirrored mask-handling supplies external pressure, but the relationship crucible is implied more than staged, keeping the score just below 9. No contradictory impulses are voiced in scene—only symbolically enacted—so the quick-test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each ash line visibly deepens the gallery’s spatial compression toward the titular vanishing point, reweighting the stake “safety is drawable only in charcoal that will burn.” The final scatter is a Conceptual Repricing: the floor becomes an exitless horizon, cost felt as shoe-gray smudges on the audience. Orientation is taught by word 70; no causality breaks; closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—no one pretends they are safe. 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gallery’s forced perspective is not backdrop but tactical weapon: ash lines physically stop foot traffic, turning architecture into choice-constraint. The porcelain shard mask recurs as micro-setting—its glint signals Grandmother’s approval beat, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: charcoal warmth, hush, gray snowfall—each selected to make distance sink. Meets 9+ gate by letting environment directly shape the final tactical image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safety is mirage”—tightens through spatial compression: each ash circuit narrows exit vectors until the floor itself becomes unstable horizon. Agency is performative but real: Mara’s last scatter forecloses the option to stop, ash visibly resettles on shoes as price. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible; minor deduction for off-stage audience reaction rather than protagonist loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ash-line geometry: safety is not denied, it is redrawn until it vanishes. Subtext lives in silence—no mission statement, only the hush that follows the final scatter. The closing image reweights every prior charcoal stroke as provisional. No moralizing; resonance is optical and visceral. Quick-test exceeded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance, filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias toward erasure and negative space. Syntax alternates between long accumulative clauses and fragmentary scatter-steps, mirroring ash rhythm. No head-hop; Grandma’s interior is surfaced only via porcelain glint, staying within POV modesty. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” lens—accepted as narrator’s critical overlay, consistent with gallery meta-frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “ash lines tracing invisible boundaries” folds setting, stakes, and gesture into one clause. No synonym loops; each ash fall finds fresh tactile verb—drifts, settles, powders. Rhythm breathes with the slow circle, then snaps shut on “nobody pretends they are safe.” One mixed metaphor—“electric quiet”—but it’s early and taught, forgiven. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” trope is inverted: portraits are not exhibited, they are eradicated, making absence the medium. Vanishing-point architecture as erasure machine feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk—entire story happens in held breath during one scatter—is rewarded by legible conceptual cost. No recognizable pop-culture echo; the synthesis is specific to this voice.</comment>
