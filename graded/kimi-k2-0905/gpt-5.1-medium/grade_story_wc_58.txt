<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lady Sera’s motives—mapping “the geography of healing” through self-sequestered pilgrimages—are specific and internally contradictory; her confession under the pergola dramatizes both urge to flee and need to feel. The narrator’s profession as living-obituarist is more label than lived; no micro-choice in the walk reveals how that avocation shapes perception. Yet the shared garden circuit visibly costs her (naming each locus of pain) and earns the final image of “nothing disappears,” satisfying earned stasis. Relationship pressure is single-sided; the narrator remains observer, so status crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the garden tour reframes absence as subterranean continuation, with the phrase “nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern” delivering undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: parcel thread → meeting → co-walk → re-vision of vanishing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated naming of grief-sites thickens emotional density until the final re-weighting. Orientation is swift—harbor / palace / dusk line 1–50—and space remains coherent throughout the spiral walk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden operates as micro-setting: unpruned roses snag hems, gravel records steps, dry fountains mute echo—details that literally constrain pace and acoustics during the confession. Autumn’s browned vines and leaf-crusted bronze nymphs mirror internal withering while remaining tangible. Palace carpets and harbor cliffs anchor macro-world without exposition dump. Final image of dark harbor carrying “her presence like a lantern” recharges the garden’s extinguished lights, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator write an “explained absence” that satisfies Lady Sera—tightens when she demands he “help me walk it,” turning interview into joint pilgrimage. Each named grief-site increments pressure under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: the garden proves absence is not erasure, forcing narrator to abandon neat horizon-line narratives. Escalation is steady but single-tier; no secondary reversal, hence caps below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: vanishing as unseen persistence. Subtext resides in the unlit lamps and smoke-scented thread—objects that contradict the city’s demand for “clean departures.” No character articulates a moral; the final lantern image reconfigures grief as portable interior light. Particulars resist universal uplift, retaining ambiguity about whether such pilgrimages heal or merely ritualize pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator’s voice is lyric-accretive, syntax layering participial phrases that mimic carpet weft: “fountains dry, bronze nymphs crusted with leaves…”—pattern taught by line 3 and held to final metaphor. Psychic distance contracts perceptibly during the walk, moving from remote harbor gaze to skin-close silence. Lady Sera’s diction—“geography of healing,” “unmapped interior country”—is distinct yet plausible for eccentric recluse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence music is deliberate but controlled; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density peaks at “laces of low mist” yet remains coherent. Minor scaffold: “roses bowing beneath their own unpruned abundance” could trim to “roses bowed under unchecked cane,” but image is vivid. Propulsion stays high; each paragraph advances either spatial leg or emotional disclosure. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise flips obituary into anti-obituary for the living—fresh angle executed through concrete garden cartography rather than abstract inversion. Carpet-weft metaphor recasts psychological withdrawal as structural support, transforming familiar recluse trope. Risk taken with near-allegorical tone pays off via sensory specificity. While “grieving aristocrat in decaying garden” is familiar, the weft/pilgrimage synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
