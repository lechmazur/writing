<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s curiosity-driven trespass and evolving apprenticeship are credibly motivated; the translucent tutor’s “death is mostly a scheduling issue” line crystallizes his liminal ethos. Interiority stays concrete (“some old etiquette manual had opened in my spine”) and degrades under wonder without lapsing into reportage. The final gesture—grasping the seal while accepting the building’s denials—earns a quiet renunciation with felt cost, though the emotional arc is slightly under-articulated between beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers sensory mosaics until the rooftop meteor shower reweights the stake. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; the kettle-groan cue bridges planes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seal’s empty circle re-tunes the building’s voice and the narrator’s tenancy, charging “agreed upon lies” with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; the ghost’s scheduling aphorism is the persistent constraint that shapes every tea session.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and antique seal function as micro-settings that literally channel the building’s grammar; the seal’s brass softness is re-handled in multiple beats and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—sugar-jar emptiness drives the first trespass, meteor-tinged basil focuses the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: fire-escape ladder, planter boxes, and the seal’s placement track without drift. Environment constrains the final choice—only while lying on the roof under meteors can the narrator “listen for the next story.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the language before demolition”—is signaled early and tightens when the seal’s blank ring makes the building’s denials audible. Agency is attention rather than plot heroics; the narrator’s choice to clasp the seal and accept lies narrows future options. Cost is conceptual but legible: tenancy now requires carrying denials “as gently as their truths.” One deepening, no reversals; accumulative pressure suffices under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of language, architecture, and self-deception; no explicit thesis. The “agreed upon lies” reprise at closure reweights earlier material without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the seal leaves no imprint yet rings like a bell—implying translation is absence-shaped. Emotional aftereffect is melancholic wonder rather than message.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a patent perceptual signature: “air taste like paper left too long in rain,” “focus itself had turned up a notch.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for rooftop stargazing, staccato trespass opener. Diction stays within educated-but-not-academic range; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, each line goal-driven: “You want something from the building” forces confession. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“I realized then”) and are paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “yellow lamps should not flicker sea-green” does triple sensory/otherworldly work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is patterned—sky drafts, meteor punctuation—taught early and paid off. Minor whisper of purple in “meteors scratched quick silver questions” but fits lyric register and does not obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing ghost-tutorial with architectural linguistics feels inevitable and fresh; the dead tutor’s translucence is never explained yet fully exploited. The antique seal as blank key reverses the usual haunted-prop trope. Risky accumulative structure taught by second paragraph and holds. Specificity—roof tomatoes, landlord’s wink-garden—grounds the conceit in lived urban texture.</comment>
