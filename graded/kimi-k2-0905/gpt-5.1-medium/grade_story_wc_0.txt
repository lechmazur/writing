<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—mourning catastrophe yet craving quiet science—is vividly embodied in her tactile setup of dust-traps. Her “kindled humility” is shown, not told, through micro-choices (taping leaks imperfectly, smelling iodine, refusing drama). The final refusal to seal the greenhouse perfectly crystallizes her renunciation with on-page cost: she surrenders dryness for memory, a visible trade-off that earns her stance. Minor dip: Amir functions mostly as sounding board, so relationship-as-crucible pressure stays light.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the image of narrowing leaks while accepting perpetual damp re-weights her scientific method and emotional stance with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each filter, vine, and puddle accretes meaning until the final cadence. No orientation debt; who-where-when are anchored by line three. The single tightening beat (deciding to let the greenhouse stay partly wet) is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s broken glass, iodine reek, and sagging trellis actively constrain every move—where she places filters, how she tapes plastic, why she accepts damp. The setting literally drips into her data, charging the final image: a lab that remembers water. Micro-setting objects (cracked pane, muddy brick tide-line) recur with evolving states, mirroring her internal softening. Environment–body–tool circuit is complete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she relinquish explosive spectacle for quiet accretion—tightens when she chooses dust traps over supernova telemetry. The moment she tells Amir “I am trying to stop mistaking fireworks for truth” narrows her professional identity with a public, felt cost. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational and stance-driven. One meaningful deepening is exactly what 700-word fiction needs; we feel the gradient descend.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repetitions of settling, staining, and remembering: knowledge comes not from bangs but from slow deposits of damage and data. Final image of “quiet and cumulative” truths lands as Conceptual Repricing without sermonizing. Subtext in Amir’s frown and Lena’s laugh carries the mutual recognition of methodological grief. No thematic echo violations; the word “humility” appears once, earned by flood memory, not editorial assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close narration maintains a precise perceptual signature: physics lexicon (“braided matter into pure equation”) filtered through newly humbled attention to dirt and damp. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for reflection, staccato for wind-shoved squalls—without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is sparse but carries indirection; Amir’s “less dramatic…” line reveals status shift and affection in one beat. No head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines (“water had risen past the third-floor observatory, swallowing her simulations…”) advance both backstory and emotional stakes without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“catastrophic punctuation marks”) fits an astrophysicist’s mind yet stays within POV lexicon. One minor paraphrase loop on “dust” mentions in closing paragraph, not enough to dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing neutron-star physics with post-flood citizen science is fresh; the granular metaphor—each dust mote as ion from a cooling star—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken by making the climax a refusal to dry the lab, yet the conceptual payoff is clear. Specificity of salvaged power strips, cucumber vines, and paper filters prevents abstraction. No derivative premise debt; the “scientist turns to humble observation” arc is remade through exact material detail.</comment>
