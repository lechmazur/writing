<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—cataloging monsters for pay while craving release from that role—are alive in every beat; the twin’s invitation to “stay and rewrite” crystallizes an earned renunciation paid for by the burning hand on the emerald card. Interiority stays concrete (“the absence hurt worse”) and avoids label-speak. Cost is visible: the professional self is abandoned on the page. One hairline slip: the twin’s motivation to flee is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (carousel mirrors, ticket-stub curtain) thickens the stake until the theater-garden reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“I stayed, a blissfully aberrant shadow”—reweighting the premise that classification was inevitable. Time is anchored by sensory cues within 120 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the emerald card burn lingers and shapes the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ship’s rotting carousels, fog-wet brass, and mirror corridors are filtered through the POV’s taxonomic gaze; every object (swatch card, ticket hedges) constrains navigation and charges the final garden image. Spatial logic is tight: gangway → shooting gallery → funhouse → theater. Weather and decay affect bodily contact (cold-burn). One minor over-description loop—“carnival lights flickering awake in hesitant constellations”—barely dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the classifier’s life versus reclaim the twin—tightens when the narrator chooses to stay aboard, forfeiting off-ship identity. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The mirror gallery micro-turn forces recognition of unlived selves, narrowing options. Cost is legible: professional future is renounced on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: identity is not taxonomized but cultivated by accepting aberrance. The garden is revealed as an internal seed, reweighting the quest without moralizing. Motifs (swatch card, mirrors, ticket stubs) return transformed, not checked off. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—“impossible lives keep burning”—without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a cataloguer’s precision warped by lyric longing; sentence rhythm tightens under pressure (“rows of seats occupied only by silhouettes made of smoke”). Perceptual signature is consistent: greens are memories, mirrors are chapters. No head-hopping; twin’s dialogue stays distinct in cadence and subtext. One filter-verb cluster early (“I thought… I realized”) is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences often twin image and motion (“rust running backward like water”). No loops or scaffold beyond one near-repeat of “burning.” Metaphors stay coherent (mirrors = corridors of face). Strong verbs anchor every beat. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing”—is earned by narrator’s professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maritime ghost-carnival and ontological twin-hunt feels inevitable yet unexampled; the garden turns out to be internal marrow, not external plot coupon. Risky time-as-viscous conceit is taught early and paid off in theater mutation. Familiar doppelgänger trope is re-animated through taxonomic occupation and memory-botany. Final reconfiguration could not survive relocation to another venue or object-set.</comment>
