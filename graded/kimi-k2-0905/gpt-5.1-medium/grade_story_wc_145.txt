<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cartographer’s interior contradiction—precision versus the lure of a rogue, self-authored command—drives every beat; embodied unease (“familiar, subtly confident twitch”) undercuts diagnostic self-talk. Micro-choices (packing red pencil, stepping onto ice) tie professional identity to existential wager, and the final kneel to sketch is a costly refusal of bureaucratic safety. Flaws complicate rather than decorate: obedience to an unremembered note is a gamble with no safety net. The earned, visible cost is the moment the red line splits the blank shore; no epilogue is required to feel the career he is about to torch.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: falcon delivery → forged note → ice crossing → seam revelation; each because/therefore link narrows options until the protagonist commits cartographic heresy. The cylinder sketch and condensation pattern are telegraphed early, paid off when they meet at the bluff seam, forging a single Decisive Change. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5 and never drift. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “quiet trouble it would bring” foreshadows bureaucratic reprisal, making the new line a burning bridge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment acts as tool: ice groans underfoot, bluff seam steams—both resist survey orthodoxy and literally redirect the pencil. Sensory triage—iron-bright sky, silent wings, rusted ribs—mirrors the protagonist’s narrowed professional attention. Micro-setting (condensation on one windowpane) functions as GPS, guiding the final walk and earning its keep in closure. No static postcard lines; every detail either creaks under weight or bleeds warmth into the cold that decides the route.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth of river origin versus official atlas—tightens when personal handwriting commands the search. Escalation is one continuous ascent: bureaucratic silence → ice corridor → steaming seam, each step foreclosing retreat. The final narrowing occurs at the kneel: redraw or obey; the red pencil’s touch is the irreversible payment. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (condensation map) complicates rather than solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between sanctioned representation and lived geography; nothing is asserted, everything is sketched. The phrasebook scrap’s multilingual agreement literalizes convergence without preaching. Final image—red line on blank ice—reprises “singular convergence” and reweights every prior approved map as lie. Ambiguity is productive: head-office backlash looms, yet the moral remains cartographic, not moralistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is dry, cartographer-precise: “atlas proofs spread like fallen feathers,” “flourish on the final letter,”—diction stays within a map-maker’s lexicon. Rhythm tightens with pressure: clauses shorten on the lake crossing, then expand at the bluff revelation. No head-hops; silence is used as dialogue, parsed through a surveyor’s habit of listening to metal. Filter verbs appear only when they mimic professional hesitation (“I felt the familiar twitch”), serving voice rather than padding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “ice accepted my weight with a complaining crackle, but held” simultaneously propels, senses, and foreshadows. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (iron lake, fallen feathers, dry stare) is used once and left to resonate. Syntax modulates from languid dock sentences to drum-beat steps across the ice, echoing the internal crescendo. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors that could be lifted out as proof of structural polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lonely outpost, messenger falcon, secret message—are retooled through cartographic minutiae and bureaucratic dread, making them feel earned rather than borrowed. The ice-to-river origin is fresh: hydrology as personal revolt. Condensation-as-map gadget is taught early and repaid, avoiding gimmick status. Risky compression (no back-story dump, no antagonist face) heightens stakes without thinning credibility.</comment>
