<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s needle-prick blood-drop, the flame-bent lie-detector beat, and her refusal to crown the prince with a story all crystallize a believable, contradictory interior. The “miscounted” star-maps as smuggling ciphers give profession immediate tactical bite. Only minor slack: the prince’s fever feels labelled, not embodied, and his uncle-fall motive is off-page cue. Still, her micro-choices visibly foreclose paths with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: missing stars → false charts → prince seeks untraceable route → Liora sews absence-void map that warns him of erasure. The empty palace loop in the cloth is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—ghost path chosen. Orientation anchored by frost prints and candle by line 6; no ambiguity. Closure beat lands with visible constraint: “those who walk there vanish completely.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glass, frost ghosts, and candle-shadow twins create a tactile observatory micro-setting that constrains (flame=polygraph). Selective sensory hierarchy—indigo cloth color, frost soundlessness—mirrors theme of erased stories. Spatial choreography clean across spiral stairs, desk, bench. Autumn cold never generic; it narrows breath and fuels candle’s survival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can covert intelligence survive regime rewrite? Tightening occurs when the stitched void where palace should be forecloses the prince’s heroic narrative—he must risk erasure. Agency stays in Liora’s hands: each stitch is a because/therefore decision that raises cost. Price legible: “move where no story predicts you will move” = social death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—history’s erasure vs embroidery’s persistence—emerges through cloth and void, never sermon. Subtext in flame’s leaning, the empty loop, and “ghosts hear clearly” reweights power as listening, not ruling. Final image answers thematic question: silence as archive. Complex ambiguity: prince may still choose erasure; Liora accepts complicity in ghost-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: frost as “ghost fingerprints,” stars as whispered confessions, flame as blue tongue. Syntax mirrors stitch rhythm—long sentence loops, short knots. Free-indirect fuses Liora’s skepticism: “they laughed when she miscounted...never noticing.” No head-hopping; prince’s dialogue coltish, impatient vs her elliptical calm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: “power moved not in straight lines but through adjacent possibilities” entwines concept and metaphor without drift. Varied sentence openings; no scaffold loops. Only hairline slip: “conspiracies unraveled and rewove themselves” is near paraphrase of earlier re-weave image, but cadence just distinct enough under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial cartographer as rebel archivist, flame-as-polygraph, and void-map that weaponizes absence feel inevitable yet unexampled. Occupational specificity (galaxy-chart embroiderer) drives plot rather than décor. Risk of empty palace as tactical advice could have collapsed into gimmick but earns retroactive awe through cost line. Voice, world, and theme cohere as singular stance.</comment>
