<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper’s motivation to offload “borrowed memories” is vivid, but the investigator’s turn to accept the boutonnière hinges on one persuasive line rather than a visible erosion of resistance; the interior micro-pivot is implied more than dramatized. Still, the keeper’s softly persistent cadence and bone-colored edelweiss create an unforgettable, specific obsession that charges every beat he occupies. The final pinning of the flower onto the investigator earns a felt cost, but the investigator’s contradictory impulses remain summary-level, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the investigator’s assumption of the edelweish re-weights the premise—witnessed isolation is now inherited duty—at exact visible cost (pinning the flower and waiting). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each reported “absence” tightens the conceptual trap so the final image crystallizes options rather than explains them. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the 25 % mark and holds through the last line. No orientation debt, no causal gaps, no loop artifacts touching the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock’s moonstone glow and cataract-blind lighthouse windows are not backdrop but tools: the planks literally color the investigator’s perception and the caged lantern mirrors the keeper’s occluded memories. Mist is both atmospheric and functional—it hides the “invisible” memory objects the keeper manipulates, making setting participatory. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single long take down the dock. Environment constraints directly shape the final stance; this satisfies the 9+ gate, but the dock’s physicality could bite even harder into the investigator’s body to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens into a deeper one: accept or refuse the memory-transfer ritual. Escalation is textural: each named “gap” (unraised cup, empty chair) increases conceptual pressure until the investigator’s agency crystallizes in the final pin. Cost is felt: the act of waiting in the mist wearing bone-white edelweish manifests the inherited loneliness. Under the Accumulative lens this single meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the price could be sharpened by an immediate sensory consequence (cold, ridicule) to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as contagious burden, isolation as communicable service. The edelweish’s color shift (white → bone) and final reprise perform a Conceptual Repricing that reweights solitude from affliction to vocation. No moralizing, only image-argument. Subtext lives in gesture: the keeper cups “nothing,” the investigator later cups the flower—silent consent to an ethic of bearing witness. The ambiguity is meaningful and haunting; the reader is left to decide if this is mercy or curse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: maritime twilight optics, bureaucracy-speak (“routine inquiry”) scraped raw by lyric surges. Rhythmic control—long breathless clauses that collapse into single-line revelations—mirrors the investigator’s dawning vertigo. No head-hops; keeper’s interiority surfaced only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Filter-verb stacks appear but are voice-motivated (“I realized,” “I felt”) to flag epistemic slippage; they do not dull immediacy. The keeper’s idiom is distinct, softly persistent, edged with antique flower-lore, satisfying 9+ distinctiveness with only hairline surplus filters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Almost every sentence carries double duty: sensory punch + conceptual map (“wet planks throwing back colors no one had painted there”). Metaphors are coherent—mist as living membrane, lighthouse windows as cataracts—and map onto memory’s haze and blindness. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles. Clause variety and paragraph cut-test pass; removing any paragraph would erase a knowledge tilt or sensory cue. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final pin, then snaps to stillness; line-level craft is exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “borrowed memories” conceit is freshened by treating recollection as transferable, physical absence—an inversion that makes forgetting a gift and remembering a burden. Nautical-twilight witness-suicide is familiar gothic fodder, but here the gesture is reframed as consensual memory donation, converting trope into ethical paradox. Specificity—opal dock, cataract lantern, bone-white alpine flower—anchors the concept so it could not relocate without disintegration. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure pays off: meaning accretes rather than twists, yielding inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
