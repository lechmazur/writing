<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A single, consistent POV whose tactile ritual steadily reveals interior ache. Micro-choices (circular sanding, hand-weighing) externalize grief without slipping into label-speak. The final gift to the children crystallizes the vow; cost is felt in the ache of “almost like a heart.” No contradiction under pressure; interiority stays embodied and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared early (soft light gathered, no fire) and held to the final “gentler way to shine.” Orientation anchored inside 120 words (“In the serpentine grotto… I lay out…”). Closure achieves Charged Poise: the cloth opens, options re-weighted, sky “bowed low” with undeniable conceptual cost—light without burn now belongs to the children. Persistent constraint (fear of fire) shapes every polishing move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto, basin of sand, body-as-workbench all constrain the only possible tactic—hand-polishing. Sensory triangulation (lemon-rain air, slick stone breathing) is filtered through the narrator’s professional vigilance for hidden stars. Micro-setting (the shard itself) charges the final image; without its glow the children see nothing. Environment never drifts into tourist catalog; every detail is worked by hand or breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver calm light to refugee children—signaled in first third and tightened only once: “I swore then to share light without using fire.” Escalation is density/cadence, not causal turns: each polished fragment adds emotional mass until the galaxy-in-cloth overbalances the grotto dark. The visible price is spent breath, abraded knuckles, reopened memory; cost stays legible in the closing glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “light without fire” rather than thesis statement, culminating in the children’s cupped moons. Subtext lives in gesture: weighing the shard equals weighing a lost heart. Final image reweights the premise—gentleness itself becomes sustainable illumination. No moralizing, only crystallized stance; ambiguity lingers in whether such light can outlast the tide-drum outside.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person sustains a hushed, tidal cadence; patterned elision (“I begin to rub… breath finds the rhythm”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature—stars inside dull glass, ocean hush in stone—never drifts into generic uplift. Psychic distance tightens under pressure without voice slippage. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles during the crucial polishing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and breathing space, mirroring sanding strokes. Information density high: one line often fuses action, memory, sensory cue (“The grotto settles… mist folding like petals”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse enough to retain clarity. Minor register lift (“zephyr bloom”) is voice-motivated and taught early; does not obscure causal chain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trauma-healing-through-craft trope is re-angled by refusal of fire and the geologist’s lens on sea-glass astronomy. Specificity of “rain and lemons” scent, grandmother’s shard, sand-wheel technique makes the lens personal. Risk—quiet lyric escalation rather than overt reversal—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Conceptual payoff (“the sky has bowed low”) feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
