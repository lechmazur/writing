<comment>Brann's alien-historian identity is vividly embodied—cloth-wrapped boots, conductive palms—yet his interiority stays abstract ("simple and strange, even to himself"). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the sole micro-choice is to keep descending to the next fireplace, a repetition not escalation. The cost is conceptual, not personal, so the arc plateaus rather than deepens. Still, the non-human stance is sustained without anthropizing slips.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of wall-absorbed memories tighten into the final CR that stories outlast dreamers. Orientation is immediate; silo-library, post-human era, and Brann’s quest are anchored by line 4. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “old ones were enough work” reweights the premise that new dreams are needed. One transition (diary → tapestry) is legible and keeps the lens.</comment>

<comment>The reclaimed silo library is not backdrop but instrument: spiralling shelves guide Brann’s literal descent and metonym for cultural descent. The fireplace’s “blackened mouth” and the tapestry’s “interrupted orbits” are handled twice each, their material history altering his sensory route. Dust-filmed skylight, bronze-quiet air, and soot temperature all return in the final image, charging the CR with tactile cost. Setting micro-constrains every probe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can erased human memories be re-voiced? Pressure intensifies texturally—each artifact adds spectral testimony—rather than causally narrowing options. No reversible jeopardy faces Brann; the cost is transferred to the vanished humans, felt as conceptual loss rather than personal risk. Closure qualifies as CR, not DC, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “walls remember what minds forget,” seeded in Brann’s belief, textured through diary & tapestry, reprised in final line “library listened with all its walls.” No explicit thesis states this; the realization is imaged, not moralized. The displaced axis motif threads geology into epistemology, giving the thought a planetary scale without abstraction overload. Subtext of archivist guilt stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, elliptical, lyric—matching Brann’s alien sensorium: “bronze quiet,” “knots like interrupted orbits.” Pattern of compound metaphors is taught early and sustained; no cadence drifts into monotony. Perceptual signature stays consistent—heat through circuits, hum in walls—without filter-verb bloat. Final image crystallizes rather than explains, fulfilling the taught compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, concept: “Pages curled like autumn leaves, ink blurred into small storms.” One paraphrase loop (“wall…remembered…remembered…remembered”) is purposeful anaphora, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift; even “displaced axis” keeps physics consistent. Momentum breathes with paragraph length variation, never stalls in description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-human archivist reading scorched walls—is non-obvious yet immediately legible. Combines library-silo, tapestry fragment, and geological slip into one sustained metaphor machine. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced but controlled by sensory anchoring. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course walls outlive dreamers, of course a historian built by machines would seek warmth in ash.</comment>
