<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—his “frugal” trait shows in lived detail (paper > food, rented room). Micro-choices (tracing numerals, flicking breakers) reveal hierarchy of values. Flawed devotion drives the climax; the renunciation—shutting lights, embracing doubt—carries visible cost. No second character, so status dynamics N/A; single-POV voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of repeated alignment attempts tightens stakes via density, not causal chains. Closure is Charged Poise—final cloud-reveal reweights prior notebook smudge with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“dusk…palace”). No teleporting props; tile warmth is subjective perception, not break. Cost legible in final sentence: “richer by a question he could never exhaust.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through astronomer’s lens: floodlights become “invisible columns,” tarps “sleeping colossi.” Micro-setting—the tile’s cool matte surface—constrains his tactile choices and charges closure. Palace-between-regimes supplies stealth access and controllable lights, enabling experiment. sensory hierarchy favors sight/smell over tourist catalog; spatial choreography clean from gallery to courtyard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: test whether cosmic order answers human pattern. Escalation via iterative beam-star approximations; each near-miss increases cognitive cost. One tightening: planet slots exact node, reweighting prior dismissive smudge. Cost felt in final embrace of “usable doubt”; no off-stage resolution. Coincidence complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: measurement vs. longing, order vs. entropy. No explicit thesis; “encrypted devotion” reframed from solution to lifelong question. Final image reweights earlier motif—smudged notebook page becomes celestial echo. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“empirically ironic,” “encrypted devotion”) stays inside astronomer’s conceptual lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, fragments under star-fit tension. No dialogue, so voice contamination N/A. Perceptual signature—numbers as names, lights as abacus—distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“beams rose like invisible columns…converting the courtyard into a three-dimensional abacus”). No scaffold loops; metaphors consistent (abacus, chapel, grid). Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”—is narrator’s own taxonomy, justified. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian palace-museum as between-regimes laboratory, clay magic square as star-map interface. Risky structural choice—no antagonist, no dialogue—paid off via accumulative tension. Transformation test fails if tile swapped for any artifact; its numeric skin is integral. Specificity of black-market dig, cuneiform sums, spice-shop garret prevents generic drift.</comment>
