<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gardener’s contradictory compulsion—joyful whistling while bound to unfinished grief—shows in every tactile micro-choice (rake in hand, dirt under nails, strip pressed to tapestry). His refusal-to-leave is not declared but dramatized by the hum that answers when fragment meets border; the cost is the moment he recognizes the soil-handed opponent as his own shadow. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; the epiphany is earned because the tapestry literally stitches his past persona into present stance. Flaw complicity is irreversible: once he sees the loose strands he names himself keeper of knots, foreclosing any exit with visible existential price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the night exhales only after he palms the rewoven border and accepts perpetual caretaking. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (chess clock, sovereign case, tapestry strip) layers density until pattern reweights identity with undeniable cost. Orientation is swift: cemetery/silo/starlight anchors arrive by line 10; no disorientation serves the payoff. Causality holds: strip answers clock, climb answers tug, knowledge answers pattern; no convenient amnesia or teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo constrains the final climb and hums like a throat only when the tapestry fragment is inserted—environment literally voices the choice. Velveteen gloom, ink-through-silk, and sealed candle are selective metaphors that guide mood without cataloging the graveyard. Spatial choreography is pristine: ladder rungs ring, hatch gapes, metal floor receives the knee—all tracked. Weather and stars remain indifferent observers, mirroring the gardener’s discovered necessity to witness forever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will the gardener keep listening or cut the threads? Pressure tightens when the strip ticks against the case—first signal that passive rounds must become active decoding. Protagonist agency: he climbs, aligns, palms the weave; each act narrows his future to eternal caretaking. Cost is legible in the final exhalation—night softens because he accepts infinite unfinished games.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not flowers but unfinished decisions; graves need scissors, not wreaths. Subtext resides in silence of the spent chess clock—time ended yet persists. The tapestry border reconfigures meaning: caretaking is not devotion but self-imprisonment to keep stories alive. Final image of softened gloom offers Charged Poise—grief not solved but respun into vocation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is laced with cemetery diction—"blithe," "uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom"—all colored through a man who trims grass around sunken plots. Syntax elongates in lyrical loops yet tightens under pressure: climb becomes "each rung echoing like a small gong." Perceptual signature notices cracked glass, frayed colors, soil under nails—details only a gardener-collector of unfinished ends would prize. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded to his thigh-warm case and humming silo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from lush cumulative clauses to stark single images ("the hatch gaped"). Metaphors are selective and paid off: "sealed cobalt candle" returns as throat that clears itself. Zero loops or synonym churn; no scaffold sentences. High information density—one sentence often reveals tool, body, and emotional tilt simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses chess-clock afterlife with tapestry necromancy—fresh synthesis. Risk: the dead as loom-weavers could tilt precious, yet grounded in gardener’s rake and soil. Specificity anchors novelty: sovereign case holds cloth not coins; silo is observatory not storage. Final inversion—caretaker realizes he’s another loose strand—feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
