<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is dramatized in the moment he decides to play the voicemail: grief recoils yet is overridden. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—amber totem vs. firmware, both handled in decisive beats. Final renunciation is earned: the living laugh dissolves the haunt, foreclosing the loop with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the laugh reweights guilt into release, cost is the irrevocable airing of the last private sound. Causal lens holds—every beat from job acceptance to console drawer is because/therefore. No teleports; amber, letters, phone all tracked. Orientation is taught early via throat-door image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Laboratory constrains tactics—tape paths, server lights, console drawer—each enables the final upload. Amber micro-setting is charged at closure: its trapped insect mirrors the firmware’s trapped voices, guiding the sacrifice. Meteors outside mirror the burning inside, reconfiguring stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the firmware mimics the lost voicemail through baby-cry frequency; options narrow to playback or endless loop. Escalation is causal: each letter, each machine interface increases the pressure until only the truest sound can tether the haunt. Cost is the voicemail itself, once private, now consumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of recording: preservation can haunt unless sacrificed. Subtext lives in the amber—natural fossil versus digital fossil—without exposition. Final laugh offers resonant non-literal answer: release is not deletion but re-animation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers on whether the firmware is truly starved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person texture is constellation-tattoo specific; syntax contracts under meteor hush—“hands shaking as if meteors are dragging my bones.” Patterned elision taught early—“time folds”—and paid off in blurred clock hands. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays sleepless, vinyl-dust tasting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors reel-to-reel motion—long sentence intake, short splice release. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent: meteors as silent stitches, firmware as fireflies. High density: amber, voicemail, tattoo constellations collapse into final burn without overwritten stretch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise fuses haunt-tech with grief-recording; fresh angle is using baby-cry frequency as virus vector. Inversion of fossil—amber vs firmware—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric non-linear time folds heightens stakes without gimmick. Specific detail prevents abstract drift; voicemail laughter is irreproducible.</comment>
