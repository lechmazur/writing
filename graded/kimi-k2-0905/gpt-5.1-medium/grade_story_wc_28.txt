<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Laleh’s “hinge” self-definition crystallizes a believable internal arc; the steel arms embody the cost of her refusal to ration mercy. The micro-choice of pressing the tessera into the pillar is anchored in prior embodied emotion (scarred hands, pocket-weight). No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; solo arc earns high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s air “uncoiled” and the city steps into her arms—undeniable social cost for her aberrant mercy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mosaic step layer intensifies meaning until the tessera rewrites civic time. Orientation anchor (“ancient plaza beneath the shattered sky”) arrives by word 7; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The minaret shard and plaza mosaic function as micro-setting that literally resequences time; their tactile specificity (thumbnail size, color-stepped stone) constrains every tactical move. “Warm coldness” of refracted sunlight on steel arms charges the final image. Meets 9+ gate: object-as-setting alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can mercy survive scarcity—tightens when naming the fire “teacher” forecloses vengeance as a live option. Agency is interior/ritual, but the cost is visceral: she forfeits the safety of silence and becomes the city’s visible “hinge.” One meaningful deepening satisfies escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy as public infrastructure, not private virtue. The reframing of fire from tyrant to teacher reweights every prior image without moralizing. Final image of people “stepping carefully into gentler hold” offers resonant non-literal answer—no thesis statement required.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence—“time had retrocognitively trapped the city inside itself”—maintains perceptual signature throughout. Compression like “aberrant mercy” is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to judge; internal diction stays within plausible lexicon of apoetic activist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentence “She named the sky fractured, not shattered, so it might heal” does three jobs (re-naming act, stakes, metaphor). One scaffold trace (“step on blue, step on green, step on red”) is pattern-taught and propulsive, not looped. No figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-as-mosaic plus mercy-as-public-infrastructure feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk of lyric retrocognition pays off by making causality visual-tactile.Could not swap tessera/stepping-stone apparatus to another object without collapsing logic.</comment>
