<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity-driven interiority is concrete—his “puzzles spiraling in impossible geometries” shows obsession under pressure. The seed-planting is a micro-choice that visibly costs his complacency, satisfying the earned-change test. Missing a second beat of visible trade-off keeps this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (mud, brook-groan, seed-cold) thickens the same stake—will the town stay safely commodified or let the strange grow. Closure is a Charged Poise: “entrance instead” reconfigures the escape room’s meaning with felt conceptual cost. One causal hop—coordinates “beneath the town” arrive un-earned—drops this from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, mill shadow, and iron-smelling mud are returned to in every beat, tightening space around the seed. These environmental micro-details literally constrain where he can dig and charge the final image of the town “remade from below.” Meets 9+ gate: setting alters tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs. safety—tightens once: planting the seed forecloses the sterile comfort of ordinary escape-room nights. Cost is visible: he trades known commerce for “whatever dreamed beneath the town.” A second escalation beat is absent, capping this at 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular: seed = blueprint for experiential weirdness vs. souvenir sameness. Final image of future players “entangled” offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Nearly 9; withheld because the brook-as-metaphor could carry even more ideological weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature (“dormant constellations,” “cooled ashes”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythmic compression—“sound thinned, drawing itself inward”—mirrors his receptivity. No head-hop or register drift; pattern taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High info-density: one sentence often does three jobs—anchors setting, advances plot, textures mood. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, and closure-clear. Zero loops or mixed metaphors; occasional adjective-rich peaks (“monstrous glory”) stay within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing corpse-flower botany with underground-town myth feels simultaneously new and inevitable in hindsight. Premise transforms the trope of “strange mail” into an architectural Trojan horse. Risk of lyric ellipses heightens rather than obscures stakes, qualifying for +0.3 within-band bonus.</comment>
