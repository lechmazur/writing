<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—rooted in the cracked-teacup, stubborn-cutting pragmatism—remains concrete and embodied; the micro-choice to thread the tooth into a pendulum is a visible, costly pivot that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The contradiction between exposed-garden vulnerability and lockmaster’s hunger to carve safety is dramatized, not stated. No second character appears, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; head-count clarity is fine. The only friction is a faint label echo—“wistfully pragmatic” is voiced once too close to the climax, but it doesn’t flatten the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fire escape becomes a “low-slung constellation,” reconfiguring the stake from private grief to communal offering; the cost is felt in the exposed, fragile glass that could fall or be ignored. Causal linkage holds: petal drop → invitation acknowledged → light-sculpting act → harbor echo; every beat is because/therefore, no lucky rescue. Reflective blocks are anchored to present stimuli (moon blade on cane) and alter tactics immediately; BRR cap is waived. Orientation is locked by word 30; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake—and it stays pure to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fire escape itself is the micro-setting that constrains every choice—wind, rust, railing width dictate how far fragments can hang and how light will scatter. The harbor moon is not postcard scenery; its “blade” of light literally triggers the climactic arrangement. Tool-as-setting (the brass tooth) is handled three times, each placement calibrated to angle reflection. Spatial choreography is immaculate—reader can trace every shard and spoon from sill to wire to final sway.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—can exposed vulnerability be transmuted into shared safety—tightens exactly once: the moment she turns the tooth from relic to chandelier pivot. That act forecloses the private, hoarded grief option; cost is the visible fragility of glass that could injure or be vandalized. Agency is pure protagonist; no off-stage savior. Pressure grows by accretion of light fragments, not external antagonist, satisfying Accumulative lens. A second tightening would over-egg this length; the single deepening is sufficient and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from image pattern—locks, keys, petals, light—never abstracted into thesis. The final “constellation” reprises the father’s lock-light ethic without naming it, yielding conceptual repricing: safety is not sealed but scattered, imperfect, communal. Subtext is carried in gesture (touching tooth, whispered promise) rather than declaration. No moralizing final sentence; resonance is left glinting on the bricks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—she sees “calligraphy” of masts, measures distances like “tumblers,” hears harbor “murmer”—diction never drifts into generic lyricism. Rhythm modulates: long, oar-cadenced sentences for memory, staccato fragments during wire-twisting. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs serve voice (“she feels something inside her loosen”) rather than dulling immediacy. One microscopic POV slip: “the whole block is holding its breath” is briefly external, but the effect is choral and intentional, not omniscient intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion is exceptional—every line advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off: “masts write faint calligraphy” returns as the light itself writes on walls. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One mixed metaphor limps—“air is a quivering hush” duplicates motion and silence—but it lands early and does not touch closure. Zero typos, perfect grammar, tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fire-escape light-garden is a fresh synthesis of urban gardening and lock-picking metaphors; the bit-tooth repurposed as pendulum feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Risk is taken by making the climax an act of delicate, almost childlike craft rather than a confrontation; coherence holds because the stake was always about fragile safety. No derivative premise penalty applies—while “grief into art” is familiar, the specific mechanics (brass gauge, mirrored shards, harbor moon angle) are irreplaceable. Emotional specificity anchors the novelty.</comment>
