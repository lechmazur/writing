<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lina’s synesthetic perceptions and Marcel’s fractured-stage selves give vivid, embodied interiority; both want the same thing (one true encore) yet approach it from complementary flaws—her color-hearing vs his applause-addiction. The tarot coin micro-choice (“she touched the rim”) anchors her offer, but Marcel’s final assent is still more gesture than costly decision—he risks little new. Their status shift (projectionist summons ghost) is legible, yet the relationship crucible stays intellectual; we feel no irreversible change in their mutual stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis for Marcel, yet the price is hinted, not dramatized on his part.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard brightens, translucent hands rise, and “let us try again” crystallizes a joint wager whose failure cost is implicit in the theater’s demolition. Causal linkage holds: because the coin is placed, Marcel agrees; therefore the Wheel might turn. One minor causality wobble: “security lights dimmed” → orchard sighs into magic is accepted as genre rule, taught early. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 4 and stay stable.</comment>

<comment>The maze-orchard is not postcard scenery; its silver pears and cracked fountain constrain movement (spiral path) and supply the only props (coin on fountain lip). Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: Lina’s synesthesia dictates what she notices—citrus-green tang, brown-violet musk—while Marcel sees only footlight dust. Final image (translucent hands conducting the trees) recharges the setting as stage, merging garden and theater. Spatial choreography is clean; we track gate-to-fountain without drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the maze’s stories from erasure—signals by paragraph 6 and tightens once: “even that will lose its stories unless we do something.” Agency is shared proposal, not solo explosive act; the price (theater already doomed) is visible, but no new tactical loss is paid in-scene. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal; options narrow to “try the coin ritual or accept oblivion.” Cost is conceptual and future-oriented; sufficient for lyric closure at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art’s afterlife depends on collaborative witness, not solitary applause. Subtext in silence: the empty auditorium, unclapped echoes, and “sound to come back” that never did indict audience absence. Tarot coin’s Wheel reweights the premise—entertainment as cyclical ritual rather than disposable commerce. No final paragraph sermon; the invitation “let us try again” lets ambiguity linger about whether art can outrun capital.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is knife-sharp: “waves sounded…sun-bleached brass and torn velvet blue” is synesthetic yet economical. Syntax mirrors fractured time—stacked clauses, em-dashed costumes—without losing legibility. Compression (“every syllable a pale blue gust”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off in the luminous encore. No head-hopping; POV alternates only at clear paragraph breaks, ending under Lina’s listening lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and narrative work. Metaphors stay consistent (light as breath, color as sound) and avoid mixed collisions. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations for Marcel’s costumes, short clausal bursts for Lina’s synesthetic jolts. Minor filter-verb clot (“she had painted it during…”) is strategic backstory compression, not artifact; no loops, scaffold, or register drift in closing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-of-a-theater inside a maze-orchard is fresh, yet emotional core—obsolete performer craving encore—grounds the conceit in recognizable pathos. Synesthetic projectionist as summoner is non-obvious synthesis; her color-hearing becomes the literal key to his monochrome afterlife. Risk of lush overload is embraced but controlled; specificity (“dusk-colored plums that only ripened after the business closes”) prevents whimsy drift. Concept stays committed; no late-rule rescue, no soft reset.</comment>
