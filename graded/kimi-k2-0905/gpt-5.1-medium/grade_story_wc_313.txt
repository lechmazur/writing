<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tomas’s grief-bound vigilance is embodied in the slowed footfall and coat-pocket relic; the final decision to speak rather than warn is prepared by every rivet he ever tightened and the ache of the steeple photograph. Interior contradiction—engineer’s faith in structures vs. need to voice stories—stays active in scene, not summary. Micro-choice of holding up the photograph to the neighbors crystallizes his earned shift from private caretaker to public rememberer with visible social cost.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each surfaced artifact (label, photos) tightens the same stake—will Tomas keep pretending the town is safely erased? Trail of photographs acts as pattern break that reweights meaning; final image of neighbors’ listening faces becomes Charged Poise where cost is the lifelong burden of story-keeping he now accepts. Closure legible under lens, no causal breaks.</comment>

<comment>Midnight ridgeway and mirrored reservoir function as micro-setting that literally constrains movement—he must walk the thin bruise between water and town. Upside-down lamp posts and skeletal piers charge the final image when he holds the photograph against that same reflection, forcing neighbors to see both eras at once. Algae-furred label and sucking mud provide tactile specificity that anchors each recovered memory in bodily risk.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he keep engineering silence or start engineering memory?—is signaled early by wind-chime takedown. Each new photograph tightens the pressure under accumulative lens: the drowned past is physically surfacing and demanding vocal witness. Final oration to neighbors is the decisive renunciation of purely structural guardianship; cost is the irreversible opening of private grief to collective reckoning.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges not as “remember the past” but as the harder question: who is authorized to speak when official maps want re-silencing? Subtext operates in the silence of the wind chime and the upside-down mirror—both insist that what was erased still has agency. Final image of neighbors’ faces becoming “another kind of levee” offers resonant, non-literal answer: stories, not concrete, may be the only structure that can hold both water and time.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Tomas’s perceptions; perceptual signature vivid in “measured like someone pacing the edge of a photograph” and color-joy of sapphire label noticed even under dull sky. Rhythm modulates from long aqueous sentences to clipped final declaration, mirroring shift from inward vigilance to public speech. No head-hopping; diction stays within caretaker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Metaphors (twilight “thin bruise,” chimneys “gray fingers”) stay coherent and physical. High information density: one sentence slips label, memory, and future duty into motion. Only minor scaffold: “the water lay in a mirrored hush” and “mirrored hush between them” is deliberate echo that recharges motif, not loop.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Drowned-town-resurfacing trope is re-animated through levee warden’s occupational gaze and the invented photo-trail device, making memory recovery feel forensic rather than nostalgic. Specificity of sapphire liqueur label ties celebratory past to rot-present, avoiding generic nostalgia. Risk of quiet ending paid off by Charged Poise that reconfigures neighbors from anxious crowd to co-levee.</comment>
