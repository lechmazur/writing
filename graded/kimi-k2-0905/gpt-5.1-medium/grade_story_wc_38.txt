<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s calm-defiant stance is credibly anchored in Ara’s teachings and the dice-guided micro-choices; the refusal to “retrieve data” and decision to free the lab’s new language feel earned. Interiority stays concrete—water “tasting me for passwords” rather than label-speak. One minor slip: the leap from “I understood” to full-scale server re-write is declared, not dramatized, blunting the cost visibility. Still, the contradiction between spy-duty and discipleship pulses throughout, giving the ending its renunciation weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator codes the drowned servers into “open channels,” reweighting the lab from tomb to clandestine heart—cost is the likelihood of surface-world reprisal left hanging in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dice-pattern density, swollen pages, and oceanic breathing layer until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end. One 0.1 dock because the actual keystrokes of the liberation are elided; we get the intent but not the tactile act, softening decisive-change snap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Environment, body, and tool converge: the pressure-dome, calf-high water, and dice-box together constrain every routing decision. The fractal-ink “shorelines” in the bloomed notebook provide the charged micro-setting that re-weights the ending. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible moves in three-dimensional flooding. A hairline slip: “windowed box bolted to the bulkhead” floats unmoored until paragraph 5; quick recovery with “rusted” tactile fix, so only −0.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate Ara’s counter-surveillance dance-code—tightens once: the dice-route becomes irreversible when notebooks are found swollen but legible. The escalation is textural: each roll adds syllabic pressure, culminating in the reading-aloud beat that forces the narrator to commit. No external antagonist appears, aligning with situational/accumulative design; cost is the invisible price above, felt but not yet exacted. Could use one more micro-loss (air-tank minutes? fingertip numbness?) to viscerally price the final hack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—encryption of vulnerability as communal endurance—emerges solely through image-chain: dice-orbit, dance-margins, flooded heartbeat. No moral is stated; the final “guidance” is an open pulse, not a lesson. Subtext in the dice-pips’ “tiny planets hunting orbit” quietly equates resistance with astrophysical inevitability—lovely, never explained. The piece invites rereading to trace ciphered footfalls, achieving lingering ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice owns a scientist-poet perceptual signature: probability jargon slides into mythic register (“hangman’s dice,” “slow breath of the deep”) without register rupture. Rhythm flexes—long susurrus sentences underwater, then staccato “Six and one, three and four” that mimic dice clicks. No head-hop; elisions (“They sent me…”) are taught early and paid off. Only micro-slip: “quietly erased by saltwater, so was she” edges toward gnomic, but cadence justifies the compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence ingress, no template cadence; stacked metaphors are rationed to two per high-pressure beat, each fresh. Information density high—one line often does three jobs (“Pages had swollen… ink feathered into fractal shorelines”). Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. A lone mixed metaphor—“shadows moved with mysterious familiarity”—is borderline, but the lyric license is earned by closure payoff, so −0.2, still inside 9− band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned cold-war lab + choreography-as-cryptography + probabilistic dice-oracle feels inevitable yet unseen before. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—dance-through-code demands saltwater physics and server tape. Risk in lyric non-linear structure heightens resonance without clarity loss. Bonus +0.3 for braiding hard science empathy-weapon critique into ghost-channel elegy.</comment>
