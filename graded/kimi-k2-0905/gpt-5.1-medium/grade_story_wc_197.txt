<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lio’s interiority is concrete—kneeling to read puddles, throat aching after testimony—but the rebel identity is declared (“they called Lio harmless”) rather than shown contradictorily in-scene; the key’s persistence supplies motive yet the decisive act—speaking into the booth—is slightly under-motivated compared with earlier cautious pattern-tracing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: key → lagoon → booth → archive → coded strip; each step narrows options with visible cost (silence, exhaustion, possession of contraband code). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lio steps back carrying the strip whose distribution will foreclose anonymity—cost is felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory filter—cold brass sweat, cracked glass, diluted-metal glow—grounds orientation and later constrains action (key must fit, lagoon must be stepped into). The tram-yard’s broken tiles and peeling warehouses are economically sketched; the lagoon’s impossible glow functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preservation of erased communal memory—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the map-in-puddles points to freight gates, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: Lio’s aching throat, the strip that brands them courier. Escalation is linear rather than a sharp second reversal, satisfying short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively from negative-space imagery—booths that “never existed,” maps with streets “sponged clean”—culminating in the printed imperative to refuse indifference. No explicit moralizing; the closing “future already underway” reweights prior absences into activist charge. Complexity remains: transmission may fail, indifference may win.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent perceptual signature—slant reflections, vendor stalls trading silenced verses—without head-hop. Syntax modulates: long clause-stack for market density, clipped fragments inside booth (“silence so complete it felt curated”). Diction stays within Lio’s lived lexicon; no filter-verb clutter during high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings; information-dense lines (“copying the forgotten into a format that could survive another erasure”). Two mixed-metaphor risks—“soft gold shimmer, as if the pavement remembered a sunken star” and “jazz smuggled into a military march”—slightly dull peak beat, preventing 8.8+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-commodity markets + analog-archive phone booth + puddle-map geomancy; concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test fails if Lio is generic rebel; specificity of erased lane reflections and lagoon physics makes the piece singular. Risk in lyric structure pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
