<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—pre-emptive nostalgia versus the need to erase memories—is dramatized in micro-choices (pausing mid-stroke, tightening chest). Embodied cost is legible, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible pressure. Final renunciation is earned: he accepts being “sculpted back” by the city. Voice remains coherent and particular throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city will wake “certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten,” a conceptual repricing with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of crystals ⇄ parchments ⇄ monuments reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint—shadow shortening—shapes final tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, forecourt tiles, and monuments constrain pacing and transcription urgency; shadow lengths literally dictate which memories must be saved. Micro-setting (quill, crystal, railing droplets) is handled, not catalogued. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but remains POV-true for an archivist. Final image of chilled balcony rail reprises earlier tactile cues, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—citywide identity dissolution—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when shadow calculus shows imminent loss of Thursday-singing. One meaningful deepening: stormlight shortens a monument shadow, forcing faster transcription; cost is visible fatigue and early-arriving nostalgia. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Options narrow credibly under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: collective memory is a reciprocal sculpture—archivist shapes city, city shapes archivist. Subtext in the whispering droplets and inverted lightning avoids direct statement. Final image reweights premise: memory almost lost becomes unknown certainty. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is archivist-visual, measurement-oriented (“examining shadow lengths”). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during crystal rush, mirroring urgency. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Lyric diction stays within plausible lexicon of trained archivist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is selective, not stacked: “lightning pulsed like silent heartbeats” serves inversion theme. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor risk—“sediment of sky”—but physical logic holds. High information density; each line advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—harvested summer-quills archiving weathered echoes—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of memory and archives are transformed through tactile specificity (feathers grown from summers, crystals ringing with voices). Risky lyric accumulation pattern is taught by 25% mark and pays off in resonant final image. Removing any core element (quill, shadow calculus, stormlit height) would collapse narrative logic.</comment>
