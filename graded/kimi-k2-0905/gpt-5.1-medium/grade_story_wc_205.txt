<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—revolutionary embers cooling into archival tenderness—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she palms the shard and old chants surface as questions, her re-tooling of rebellion is concrete, embodied, and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the asteroid re-imagined as theatre of unused futures; the cost is the leak of those futures when storm curtains rise, a price felt in “burnished sorrow” that reweights the entire premise. Causal lattice holds: shard → dispute → veiled mirrors → new reflection, each because/therefore step narrowing possibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid as micro-setting: nickel-iron cornices, mirrored copper vines, and magnetic storms physically constrain choices—covering glass becomes tactical against visible time. The shard’s frozen-breath clarity recurs to re-charge the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who owns the past’s meaning—tightens when stratigraphy threatens the Council myth; covering the last mirror is the decisive agency that forecloses official history and releases imagined futures at visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history as theatre of rehearsed possibility rather than embalmed fact. The final image of Mara walking storm corridors to “keep these reimagined futures from leaking away” offers non-literal answer that reweights every prior mirror-veiling act with burnished sorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, cadenced third-person hovers at psychic distance that can slip into Mara’s synapses without head-hop; “time thickened around her fingertips” is perceptual signature impossible for any other narrator. Compression stays taught, no unmotivated register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High figurative density but patterned early (“slow, iridescent curtains”) and paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates under storm pressure, then exhales into final quiet. Zero loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time-made-visible baroque asteroid mausoleum-theatre is non-obvious synthesis; transformation test fails if relocated to any generic station. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under inferred lens and charges ending image.</comment>
