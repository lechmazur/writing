<comment>Lena’s signing of “spaces between words” is a vivid micro-choice that crystallizes her interior contradiction; the camera-as-hollow-eye motif externalizes her grief without diagnostic speak. The advisor remains a cipher—his “quietly charismatic” label never pressures her—so the relationship crucible is one-sided. Earned stasis lands: she forecloses verbal speech and accepts the camera’s silence, a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete, but the advisor’s absence of stakes caps the arc just below the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each signed silence thickens the fabric of “unwritten music” until the final chord resolves. Closure is a Charged Poise—camera click = conceptual reweighting of emptiness as instrument—cost is the audible laugh that harmonizes with harbor silence. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The advisor’s unexplained ontology is tolerable under lyric mode, but his zero causal footprint keeps the beat just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Harbor moonlight is not postcard scenery; it literally supplies the silver that “washes the inside” of the camera, constraining the final act. Body-as-setting (her signing hands) and tool-as-setting (film-less camera) both charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: gulls, stones, rigging tracked across moves. One micro-slip—“low tide” coat color is visual extra—does not dull the tactical role of light; environment materially enables the conceptual flip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—signals early and tightens through each signed hesitation. Escalation is textural: silence thickens to “fabric” she can weave; agency is her renunciation of speech, not external antagonist. Cost is legible—raw laugh that harmonizes with silence—yet the advisor applies no counter-pressure, so the tightening feels mono-directional. Sufficient for 8.0, but lacks a second fork that would foreclose an alternate path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief converted into non-verbal art via camera-as-instrument. Subtext lives in gesture—“shadows dancing on her coat” = speech made visible. Final image reframes emptiness as resonant vessel, a non-literal answer without moral. Advisor’s otherworldliness risks thematic overreach toward allegory, but the harbor’s concrete particulars anchor the abstraction. No final-paragraph thesis statement; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric POV maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is synesthetic—sound seen as light, silence as fabric. Rhythm modulates: long lapping sentences mirror tide, then staccato “soft click” resolves. Filter verbs are sparing and voice-driven (“she felt melodies rise”). No head-hop; advisor’s interior stays inaccessible, preserving mystique without cheating. Diction stays inside Lena’s sensory lexicon—“hollow eye,” “tremor before the door”—achieving prose-as-character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Metaphors are sparse but precise—“bowl of spilled stars” anchors the whole harbor. No synonym loops; “signed” repeats only when pattern demands. One mixed vehicle: “camera… violin sleeping” is justified by advisor’s musical premise. Information density high—each sentence advances image or emotional state. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the click land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—using empty camera to “photograph” silence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Sign language as compositional tool rather than identity token transforms familiar Deaf motif into lyric instrument. Moonlit harbor + hollow camera synthesize into one-off ritual. Advisor’s spectral edge skirts cliché but serves as catalyst without stealing focus. Risk is moderate; payoff is conceptual reprice rather than twist, earning its specificity.</comment>
