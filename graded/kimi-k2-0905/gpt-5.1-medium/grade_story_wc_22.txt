<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—carrying a pacifist botanist’s seeds across a militarized ruin while speaking only dead tongues—grounds every micro-choice (pod placement, listening posture, final whistle). His renunciation of human speech and acceptance of perpetual mourning are dramatized in embodied beats: kneeling to feel shrapnel quiver, brushing rust from knees, smelling rain-on-ash. No stock labels; desire is mapped onto bird-grammar and the lantern’s “narrow beam through infinity.” The closing whistle is Earned Stasis: he seals his exile with a cost legible in birds’ ragged chorus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final brown pod, smelling of rain-on-ash, reweights the entire battlefield into a covert garden-to-be; the reef’s absence is accepted as non-reversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each seed placement thickens historical strata until the pier becomes a palimpsest. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“gloom-hill coachman”) and spatial track never slips. Cost is unmissable: “her instruction still glowed like a coal in his chest” and the whistle relinquishes human futurity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “blooming jetty at twilight” functions as micro-setting: its warped planks and rusted railings physically guide pod placement and force the coachman to kneel where ammunition swells. The dead reef—an “absence so complete it seemed like a statement”—acts as negative environment that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: lantern beam, horse-ghost breath, smell of ash; no tourist catalog. Tool-as-setting gate met: the wooden seed-case and its illegible labels constrain every tactical decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—covert re-greening of a militarized shoreline—tightens through each bird-guided placement; one meaningful deepening suffices. Agency is renunciation: he keeps sowing after the reef’s failure, narrowing his future to perpetual nocturnal ritual. Cost is visceral: knees bruised by rust, lungs full of cordite memory, human language abandoned. No coincidence; birds’ grammar is earned ally, not rescuer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: seed pods labeled in unreadable script become the unspoken covenant between war and mercy. Subtext resides in the silence after the whistle—birds answer with noise that only the coachman parses as victory. Final image reweights “submerged concord” from botanist’s dream to lived stasis: garden will grow, but no human will declare peace. Avoids sermon; resonance is imagistic, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “syntax within” bird calls, “narrow vastness” as existential corridor, diction of “carbonate echoes.” Compression taught early—“After the reef dies, people said”—and paid off in final silence. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate sentences for memory, clipped fragments for placement beats. Filter verbs serve voice: “he listened” is motive act, not dilution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density—each sentence layers seed, war, language extinction. Metaphors are coherent: “flat gray tomb” for dead reef, “small ghosts” for horse breath; no mixed vehicles. Varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Final line’s “ragged chorus” is rhythmic payoff to earlier “braided calls.” Proofing clean; no typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grief-ecology and linguicide feels inevitable yet unwritten: battlefield garden seeded by monolingual coachman who speaks only extinct tongues. Bird-grammar as cartography of desire is fresh; not a climate-fiction trope. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Transformation test passed: swap reef/field/birds and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
