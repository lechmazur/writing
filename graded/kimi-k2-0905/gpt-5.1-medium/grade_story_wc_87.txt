<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific; the “broken navigator” psyche is shown through embodied micro-choices (wobbling kayak, aligning the cracked compass). Contradictory impulses—wanting to vanish vs. paddling back—coexist in-scene. The final pivot toward shore is motivated by the barnacle epiphany, but the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass thumps as metronome while he paddles toward an uncertain shore, reweighting the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causal chain holds: Lena’s text → fog-bound drift → compass failure → barnacle insight → turn back. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of poles & compass reprises tighten meaningfully. Cost is legible in the final image—“at least I was paddling toward them”—foreclosing surrender.</comment>

<comment>Fog, tide, and barnacled pylons are filtered through a surveyor’s gaze, constraining orientation and later choice. The cracked compass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight: wet-wool fog, humming wires, brass thump. Spatial choreography is clean; kayak’s yaw and pole spacing track credibly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he surrender to water or reclaim relation?”—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle stalls mid-bay, forcing a stance. Escalation is textural: each pylon pair narrows options like vanishing points, the fog thickens, the phone text lingers. Cost is legible in the final paddle strokes toward an absent shore. One deepening, no reversal, fits 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via tidal paradox: water both feeds and drowns; regret can coexist with return. The compass’s reprise from accusation to metronome reweights meaning without moralizing. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer—paddle toward absence—leaving complexity intact. Subtext in barnacle spirals quietly mirrors his own slow climb back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct: surveyor’s lexicon blended with coastal salt. Syntax flexes with kayak rhythm—long sentences for drift, fragments for compass jerk. Perceptual signature holds: numbers, pylons, declination ring. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within ex-cell-tower engineer’s plausible diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers map-memory, sensory body, and tide motion. Metaphors are controlled—“GPS channels collapse” marries tech and emotion without crowding. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line cadence resolves by image. High density with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: utility-pole surveyor adrift on water he once mapped, using grandfather’s mariner compass that fails—turning tech precision into tidal metaphor. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure reweighting. Specificity of barnacle spirals and right-of-way pylons prevents generic anywhere coast. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
