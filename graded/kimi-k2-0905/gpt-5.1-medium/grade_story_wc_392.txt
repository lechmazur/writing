<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The investigator’s interior contradiction—protect the Authority vs. see the dead—drives every beat; the silent nod at the end costs his career and is earned by the lantern-lit confrontation with the ghosts. Embodied emotion is sharp (“clipboard like a shield,” pulse in the rails). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: observe → acknowledge → resolve to report truth. Flaw remains: the moment of decision is one silent nod; a stronger physical act or renounced form would lock 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the investigator’s apology reweights every prior “unpreventable” report, cost felt in budget-endangered future. Causal chain holds: lantern flare → apparition → recognition → vow to write truth. Orientation anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once under moral pressure. Only hairline slip: apology is offstage whisper—slightly under-cranked as decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tunnel wetness, brass lantern, and rail vibration are filtered through investigator’s risk-calculating gaze; each sensory note guides choice (darkness forces lantern use; lantern flare triggers vision). Lantern reappears at climax to charge final image. Micro-setting (lantern glass, slick tracks) constrains movement and safety options. No spatial drift. 9+ gate met: lantern’s glow directly shapes the culminating decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—professional survival vs. moral witness—signaled early; pressure tightens when apparitions demand acknowledgement. One meaningful turn: vow to write the unfiltered report, foreclosing complicity. Cost is loss of supervisory protection; visible in whispered apology. No coincidence; escalation is investigator-driven. Could use one more intermediate obstacle to reach 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: bureaucratic erasure of preventable deaths is a continuing crime across centuries. Subtext carried in lantern light that “remembers” every fingerprint. Final image reconfigures earlier reports as active cover-ups without moralizing. Ambiguity preserved: no certainty the new report will save anyone, only that silence ends. Resonance lingers through fused temporal ghosts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is precise, forensic, yet lyric (“rails pinged softly, as if the memory of motion could not quite let go”). Perceptual signature—numbers, budgets, headlines—colors every observation. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into whisper, mirroring exposure. No dialogue to test, but free indirect stays clean. Lantern’s personification is POV-consistent as inherited myth. Distinctive rhythm sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are controlled, no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; “entangled memories” refrain recurs with accruing weight. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Opening and final lines bookend with sonic echo (throat clearing → silent apology). One tiny over-adjectival patch (“tight controlled baritone”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghosts of past and present subway deaths confronting a cover-up investigator—is fresh, grounded in municipal realism. Lantern-as-memory-device transforms familiar ghost-trope into archival indictment. Risk taken: lyric supernatural inside bureaucratic thriller pays off. Specificity of drought-breaking rain, brass lantern, Transit Authority forms makes concept inseparable from setting. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
