<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity-to-trouble trait is shown through embodied, on-page risk (entering alone at night, climbing into pipes). Interiority stays concrete—“hope as flow-rate”—and her final nod carries earned stoic cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are N/A. Flaw: the “equations for hope” premise is self-reported, never pressure-tested by an external challenge that could falsify it, capping short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rerouted graywater system stands as a living diagram of redirected human intent; the sextant’s reprise reweights navigation from celestial to terrestrial, with conceptual cost—she can’t summon rockets, only trickles. Causal chain holds: sextant find → plumbing map → reroute → dawn nod. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 8. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “flows” taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment-body-tool triad charges closure: the cracked skylight at dawn reframes her PVC joints as constellations; the sextant hinge becomes the distribution main’s curve. Selective sensory economy—dusty basin film, brass warmth—anchors POV bias. Spatial choreography clean: flashlight beam traces pipe runs without impossible jumps. Micro-setting (sex­tant) constrains final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she resurrect purpose through flow?”—tightens once: capped lines force her to choose reclamation over escape. Cost is visible: sleepless night, filthy hands, acknowledgment that ships won’t come. Escalation is accumulative density rather than causal reversals; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (no arrivals) shapes final image, meets 8+ bar but lacks a second irreversible trade-off for 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: abandoned pipes = frozen anticipation; rerouted drip = stoic wonder. No explicit thesis; final image of taped signs on dry planters offers non-literal answer. Recurrent “flow” motif reconfigured from hydraulic to existential without abstraction. Avoids sentimentality by keeping cost tactile—her palms are “filmed with dust and candy wrappers.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—“structures as half-finished sentences.” Diction within civil-engineer lexicon without jargon overload. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror pipe mapping; final nod is monosyllabic release. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are voice-motivated, not artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often maps pipe, memory, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; “rusted trucks and rattled out” is the only near-cliché, forgiven by sonic fit. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“feral equations” keeps hydraulic logic. Final paragraph trims modifiers, letting dawn light carry cadence. One typo-free read-aloud pass.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses derelict spaceport with carnival detritus and hydraulic metaphysics—fresh synthesis. Sextant-as-plumbing-arc feels inevitable only after it appears, satisfying hindsight test. Risk in second-person plural address to “you” never materializes; instead, stoic engineering gaze holds. Not 9.5 only because the emotional calculus is solitary, avoiding wider social stakes.</comment>
