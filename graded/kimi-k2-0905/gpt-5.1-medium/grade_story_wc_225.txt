<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elior’s guilt, tactile pawn-fidgeting, and shift from strategic pride to self-forgiveness are rendered through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final tug of thread carries visible cost: he discards the need for external redemption, crystallizing earned stasis. Interior contradiction is constant—precision vs mercy, pride vs shame—without diagnostic shorthand. Only the mayor’s frozen cameo keeps this from 9+; no live relationship crucible is tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each thread-tug because/therefore advances the staircase or darkens the tapestry, tightening options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—time restarts not by triumph but by Elior’s acceptance of unerasable guilt; the toll is the pawn’s crown now irreversibly worn. Orientation is taught early via suspended raindrops and mid-breath mayor; disorientation pays off when the bell trembles and drops fall. No causality breaks, no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivory pawn functions as micro-setting: its worn crown constrains every tactical decision and is charged in the final image. Platinum tower plates, suspended droplets, and frayed tapestry threads are selectively sensed through Elior’s chess-tutor eye—geometry, weight, reflectivity—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains crisp as he crosses the square, climbs, tugs; bodies and objects never float. Environment mirrors internal state: frozen village = frozen conscience, thawing only when he forgives himself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart time by solving the tapestry labyrinth—is signaled on arrival. Escalation is causal: each correct tug loosens time, each error darkens the village weave, narrowing options until only self-forgiveness remains. Cost is visible: tapestry villagers turn their backs after mistakes; the final tug leaves the pawn irreversibly worn. Lacks a third-level tightening to hit 9+; one more knot of consequence could have sharpened the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: strategy divorced from mercy becomes a frozen hell; only acceptance of irredeemable acts lets time move. Subtext resides in pawn-fidget and frayed thread—every tactical “win” leaves visible wear. Final image of falling rain reweights earlier suspended drops into tears that can finally fall, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo, no final-paragraph thesis—just charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Elior’s chess-board quantification of angles, weights, patterns. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“half an inch, then stilled, as if reconsidering”—mirrors tactical calculation. No head-hopping; mayor’s freeze is observed, not interiorized. Register stays within a tutor’s lexicon; ivory, filament, constellation of squares feel natural, not thesaurus bait.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes from long atmospheric opener to staccato tugs and bell-tremor beats; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—tower like “captured lightning bolt”—and stay physically true. Information density high: one sentence slips in exile cause, prince death, guilt weave without summarizing the climax. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors; opening “held breath” returns as earned final exhale when rain resumes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village whose hours are woven into a tapestry-labyrinth is fresh synthesis of clock-punk and textile magic. Chess-guilt as engine for metaphysical repair transcends stock redemption arc. Pawn-fidget decoded as temporal lock-pick feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—entire story is static tableau—pays off because motionlessness is thematic, not gimmick. Could edge higher if village history beyond mayor hint were particularized.</comment>
