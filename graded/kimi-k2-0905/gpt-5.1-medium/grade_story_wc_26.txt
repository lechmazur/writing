<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s regret-driven caretaking and his final vow to carry vanished futures are viscerally embodied; the river-stone bracelet cools against pulse, his wrists “press,” his pain “scorches.” Interior contradiction is alive: he both fears bruising dreams and invites a shadow to colonize his body. TheEarned Stasis closure—he will house wandering darkness for life—pays the cost promised by his opening belief that tending others’ lost possibilities can refill his own hollow. Minor slip: “regret felt useful instead of heavy” is a touch diagnostic; still, the embodied arc outweighs the label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pale-cloud trigger → shadow intrusion → Lio’s choice to become vessel. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: “Let me house the unbound shadows” rewires Archive rules and imposes lifelong cost. The price is on-page and felt: “luminous regret burning through each word.” Persistent constraint (his body as mobile archive) shapes all future tactics—exactly the 9+ demand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-anchored in the bracelet, the cooling beads, the down-ward aisle of magnetic tape—each constrains movement and choice. Cloud-paling and violet bruising create urgent sensory narrowing that mirrors internal stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless: petals fold, aisle opens, shadow pools at feet. The blooming library above clouds charges the final image by supplying the very architecture Lio will now roam forever; environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving vanished hope—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: cloud anomaly → shadow anchored to his collection → offer of his own body. Each step narrows options and raises cost under causal logic. The final metamorphose is irreversible and self-willed; cost is visible in the “cool tide flooding the bare rooms of his own unrecorded dreams.” One meaningful tightening is sufficient; this delivers it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: unrecorded dreams → unbound shadow → Lio volunteers to become moving archive. No overt moralizing; resonance arises when Lio absorbs Lane’s never-lived future of teaching others to coax seedlings. Final image reweights premise: Archive no longer static but embodied in a living, grieving librarian. Ambiguity lingers—can one body carry infinite loss?—without forced equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: sky “bruised violet,” dreams “bloom as translucent petals,” shadow “pooled…like an invisible vine.” Syntax mirrors Lio’s hush: long breathy clauses when shelving dreams, staccato fragments under alarm. No head-hopping; distance remains tight third-person. Under peak stress—“the ache of it scorched him”—diction stays within his plausible lexicon while rhythm accelerates. Pattern of tactile coolness vs. internal burn is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver world-rule (“after dreams became shareable”), sensory cue, and emotional tilt. No paraphrase loops; each line advances stakes or texture. Metaphors are coherent—clouds pale “as if brightness were poured out,” shadow “stretches toward the river stones”—and physically consistent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes choice without expositional puff. Minor alliteration clusters (“library’s sharp-eyed dusk noticer”) but reads intentional, not algorithmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—memory library, orphaned dream—are inverted by making the librarian the mobile archive, not the warehouse. River-stone heirloom anchors both personal grief and world tech in one object. The quiet ending risks sentiment yet lands fresh because the body-as-roaming-shelf is an inevitable, non-obvious synthesis of all prior particulars. Risk-taking (absorbing darkness into self) heightens meaning without gimmick; closure would collapse if swapped for generic self-sacrifice.</comment>
