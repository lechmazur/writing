<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—his synesthetic feel of the orris root as “a shard of hush” and his cataloguing of paint-thin fingerprints reveal a man whose flaws (hyper-attention to imperceptible change) actively complicate every step. The decisive, costly shift comes when he moves the bed toward the corner he earlier avoided, surrendering bodily comfort to answer the house’s mute grammar—an earned renunciation that closes the arc. Micro-choices (touching the lintel twice, rotating the clock) manifest his hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV texture remains consistent and idiosyncratic throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the final image—“Maybe every scuff…was the structure trying…to say I am still here”—reprices Eli’s premise that only he notices creeping normality; the house, not Eli, may have been the observer. The cost is conceptual and visceral: he forfeits cognitive sovereignty and now shares ontological breathing space with the dwelling. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies via sensory minutiae until the dropped shard triggers a cadence shift at the bed-move. Orientation anchors (who: Eli; where: crooked bay house; when: spring arrival) land within first 120 words; no ambiguity or disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but actuator: the rust-stain coastline mirror, the corner that hoards darkness, the tide-exhaling floorboards all constrain Eli’s tactics and ultimately reposition his body in bed. Micro-object—the orris shard—functions as mobile setting; when it wedges in the corner it re-weights spatial meaning. Sensory hierarchy skews haptic & olfactory (violet chill, old rain in flour sacks) fitting Eli’s synesthetic bias. Final image re-uses the bay-window metonym to reconfigure stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Eli decipher the house’s whispering grammar before it erases him? Pressure escalates through Accumulative beats: floor sigh, light refusal, storm-rattle, shard lodging—each intensifies ambient density. The meaningful tightening is the bed-drag toward the corner: a single, irreversible act that narrows Eli’s future to co-habitation rather than observation. Cost is felt—he yields territorial control and accepts reciprocal surveillance; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocal noticing: the observer becomes the observed. Subtext resides in gestures (bed dragged inches, clock rotated one degree) rather than exposition. Final Conceptual Repricing invites reader to re-weight every prior scuff and drip as the house’s own creeping normality detection. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who is haunting whom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is acute: Eli notices “lazy sigils” of gulls and “years of dropped confessions” in carpet swell—no other mind could own these metaphors. Rhythm modulates from long, tide-mimicking sentences to staccato “He unpacked methodically” beats, mirroring his oscillation between overwhelm and control. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Prose teaches its elisions early (“the streetlights daydream”) and repays them at closure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence delivers arrival, tide-breath, lint-wrapped shard, and grandmother lore without padding. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors avoided; “shard of hush” is singular and precise. No template cadence or synonym loops; sentence openings vary. Artifacts absent from closure beat; final image reads clean and resonant aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshens the tired “haunted house” trope by inverting agency: protagonist seeks to diagnose the house’s creeping changes only to realize the house may have been diagnosing him. Specificity anchors universals—bay-window rust-stain mirror feels unique to this dwelling. Risky second-person metaphor (“the house had spent the night examining him”) pays off by reframing entire plot. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into safe metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Eli’s obsessive micro-adjustments (rotating clock one degree, touching lintel twice) shape every tactical beat; without these ritual choices the house would never “answer,” breaking the arc. These decisions accumulate to the climactic bed move, showing escalation from observation to surrender. Removing the trait would collapse story logic and final CR.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Shard appears early (pocket), mediates mid-scene tension when dropped (lodges in corner, shifts room density), and re-appears in olfactory triad of the final dream-image. Its unique scent-memory property motivates Eli’s synesthetic reading of the house. Without it, the bed-move lacks sensory trigger and the corner would not acquire ominous weight.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>“Shard of hush” is first a tactile metaphor, then a literal wedge that silences Eli’s skepticism and amplifies ambient quiet so the house can speak. Concept shapes tactics: he leaves it in place to “listen,” thereby enabling closure. Late introduction as concept but strong payoff compensates.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>The trait surfaces chiefly in the narrator’s aside about “inadvertently profound diagrams”—a meta-label rather than an embodied cost. But the final realization that scuffs are the house’s own profundities retroactively gives the label functional weight, re-configuring earlier text. One beat short of full causal integration.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>“Sanctify” is dramatized through repeated micro-rituals (touching lintel, clock rotation) that Eli frames as experiments; these offerings either earn house responses (lights brighten) or rejection, directly altering his tactics. Without them, the reciprocal dialogue stalls and the bed-move—the decisive sanctification of his sleeping body—lacks preparatory logic.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Method is signaled early (“Long ago he had learned that houses speak through displaced objects”) and practiced throughout: he notes skewed rug, leaning frame, then performs his own displacement by moving bed into the corner, answering the house’s grammar. Mechanics matter on every page; removal would erase the story’s operative language.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Quiet bay imparts tidal breathing that syncs with house respiration, supplies the coastline-shape rust stain, and provides storm that dislodges shard. Setting nudges choices but does not block external options; mostly atmospheric pressure rather than tactical constraint.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>“While the streetlights daydream” beautifully frames arrival and later porch vigil, giving temporal mood but never becomes a ticking clock that forces immediate action. Time remains loose and poetic; tightening decisions do not hinge on precise elapsed minutes.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>Core desire stated upfront—to learn why houses feel alive—propels every observational beat and sustains interior pressure. Conflict erupts when evidence suggests the house may be studying him, flipping his epistemic goal into ontological surrender. Desire is continuously dramatized, not told-only.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Tone of hushed blaze is established in phrase itself and carried via muted sensory intensity (violet chill, flour-sack rain) that burns quietly beneath every line. It modulates: storm heightens to audible rattle, then settles into darker hush of shared breath at closure, recharging the final image.</question>
