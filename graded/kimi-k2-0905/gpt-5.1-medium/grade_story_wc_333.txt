<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The interior arc is lucid: the narrator’s fear-guarded idea moves from paralysis to self-forced release, each micro-choice (handing over the vial, thanking fear) grounded in prior causality. The locksmith stays enigmatic yet decisive; his “key-watching-door” stance crystallizes status without exposition. Cost is felt: once the vial opens, the old safety is foreclosed—no backpedal possible. Flaw: “improbable longing” is named, not embodied; one label-speck keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single, legible causal chain: vial-offer → uncorking → internal hinge-shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the starlit “begin” reweights every prior locked thought with undeniable cost under Causal lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no prop or rule drifts. The star-hint mechanic is set up early and paid off in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test. Only the lightest skim of redundancy in fear-thanking keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct is no backdrop; its height and river-roar pressure the choice to drop guard. The vial functions as micro-setting—its glass skin, daylight smear, and uncorked tilt materially constrain action and camera. Starlight arrives as a timing device that forces the beat of release. Every environmental detail is filtered through POV dread; no extra postcard clutter. Meets 9+ gate: object-as-setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the idea from fear—is signaled in line 3 and tightens exactly once when the vial is opened, trading safety for exposure. Escalation is causal, not repeated: each beat narrows option space until renunciation is the only path. Cost is visible—“the old safety is foreclosed” is felt in the skull-pressure shift. No coincidence resolves; the star merely times the irreversible choice. Could use one more physical stake (time, tool, social) to hit 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete metaphor: locks are internal, fear is a door that grew over the threshold. No moralizing; the final “thank fear / step aside” is an earned action, not a lesson. The hair-ribbon, river stones, and star echo the lock motif without checklist strain. Ambiguity lingers—idea released, but future risk is felt, not sermonized. One abstract phrase (“cosmic possibility”) ticks cliché, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is perceptually specific—”the sky bruise,” “river broken roars,” “key watching a door.” Rhythm coils under pressure: clauses shorten as the vial opens, mirroring breath release. No head-hop; psychic distance stays tight. Diction never exceeds the narrator’s sensuous lexicon. Minor echo of “improbable longing” is the only non-embodied label; else flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“hinge,” “lock,” “star”—so payoff justifies the lyrical stack. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“vein torn from the dark”) is justified by the hair’s color and momentary shock. Closure line is clean, no artifact touch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “meet the mysterious mentor” template but flips agency: mentor performs one ritual, yet protagonist must renegotiate fear alone. Internal lock-picking is fresh terrain; no genre clichés. Risk—lyric compression of cosmic scale—heightens meaning without obscuring causality. Specificity of mother’s hair color under moonlight makes the image unportable. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
