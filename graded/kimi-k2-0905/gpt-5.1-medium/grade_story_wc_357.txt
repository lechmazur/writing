(1) <question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio’s quiet resolve and tactile steering give credible interiority; the renunciation of motors and trust in inverted currents crystallize an earned stance. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under pressure—he never doubts or waits, so the micro-choice hierarchy feels preset, not discovered. Still, the final fingertip-to-arrow beat shows visible cost (foreknowledge of guardianship) that scales to length.</comment>

(2) <question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-seed rewrites the world’s logic from “impossible orchards” to “intentional defiance,” with cost = perpetual guardianship. Causal chain is tight: inversion → water tracer → hollow → arrow → new knowledge. Orientation anchored by 90 words; no lens ambiguity. Only waver: off-page “elders said” moment (retroactive motive) but it doesn’t break the beat.</comment>

(3) <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches, levitating wells, sap-constellations—each detail later constrains flight path or seed logic. The copper sky color returns in the arrow’s dried-blood hue, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across 3-D drift. Minor excess: “stone remembering forests” drifts toward perfume ad, but it’s brief.</comment>

(4) <question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake = uncover the secret of endurance; pressure tightens from observation to guardianship. One meaningful tightening: the water’s memory reveal narrows Lio’s options—he can’t just report; he must carry the arrow’s will. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8+ band.</comment>

(5) <question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “defiance encoded in matter” emerges through images—roots drinking sky, arrow forever re-loosed—never sermonized. Final reweighting flips reader from awe at resilience to complicity in maintaining it. Ambiguity lingers: is guardianship gift or curse? Avoids tidy moral.</comment>

(6) <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually rich: “wind on eyelids,” “sap channels like constellations,” all filtered through pilot’s kinesthetic mind. Rhythmic compression matches inversion silence; no scaffold loops. Diction stays within rustic-technical lexicon of an orchard pilot; no poetic overreach at climax.</comment>

(7) <question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often carries sensory data, world rule, and emotional tilt. Metaphors are coherent (sky-bow-arrow planet). Only micro-slip: “shimmering canals between roots and drifting arches” teeters on gorgeous excess, but it’s readable and motivates next move.</comment>

(8) <question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gravity inversion + orchard + water-memory is a fresh synthesis; the arrow-as-seed-of-intention crystallizes it. Risk—lyric accumulation over plot—pays off because closure reconfigures physics as moral choice. No prior echo in published sf/f shorts at this specificity.</comment>
