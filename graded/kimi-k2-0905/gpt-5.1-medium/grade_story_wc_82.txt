<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete—her hesitation at the cliff, the flayed-heart sensation while polishing the memory—but the daughter-loss motive is only asserted, never dramatized, so the “uncut stone” she carries feels pre-labelled rather than earned. Micro-choices (folding, breathing on the globe) visibly cost her, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps her from full individuality. Still, the final renunciation is credibly paid for by the polishing agony, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s cost clause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica rafters crowded with glowing cranes reweights every prior lantern and dream, and the cost—Liora’s flayed heart and the swallowed scream—is legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of thinning, polishing, folding tightens until the cadence shift at the basilica door. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the illegal dream trade purchases her altitude, a price that shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and copper polishing wheel are not backdrop; they supply the only means by which grief can be alchemized. Spatial choreography is immaculate—shadow up, Liora up, cranes aloft—so environment literally steers the ascent. The basilica’s crystal buttresses “catch moons the sea has forgotten,” a specificity that reappears inside the final glowing cranes, satisfying the 9+ gate of setting charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she render her own grief bearable?—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens once: the memory must be polished, not merely stored. The polishing wheel is the visible price that alters tactics; each spark “flays” her heart, foreclosing the option to stop. Under the accumulative lens, density increases until the basilica hum becomes undeniable; coincidence never resolves, only crystallizes her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image of glass/light as grief-medium: lanterns for strangers, basilica for herself, cranes for everyone. No moral is stated; the final sky of folded sorrow is the non-literal answer. The conceptual re-pricing is that illegal dream-recording becomes a public service—an inversion earned by every prior lantern. Subtext sits in silence: the absent daughter is never named, only folded, letting the reader feel the hollow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Liora’s perceptual signature—steam “twists like uncut paper,” glass “shudders”—with rhythmic compression under pressure: “She can bear no more.” Elliptical pattern (“thinner than last year,” “darker the higher”) is taught early and paid off in the ascending shadow. No filter-verb stacks; diction never exceeds her craftsperson’s lexicon. Voice modulates from hush to burn as the wheel spins, matching emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify from gerund to verb to prepositional phrase. Figurative control is precise—“sparks of seawater leap”—and never muddled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “lanterns sway…lanterns shatter” re-uses the noun without fresh angle, but this is outside the closure beat. Information density is high; every sentence adds image, motion, or emotional charge. No loops, no synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The dream-recording lantern-maker who must polish her own nightmare is a fresh synthesis; the inversion that she illegalizes herself into salvation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulative shards instead of causal scene—pays off by making the basilica’s final glow a conceptual re-pricing of every prior lantern. Specificity of “moons the sea has forgotten” and “copper wheel whispering with impatient rotation” prevents trope drift. Transformation test fails: swap glass for paper or cranes for boats and the whole conceit collapses.</comment>
