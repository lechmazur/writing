<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory desire to “know less” is embodied in every scrape of soot; the hobo nickel micro-choices (pocket → palm → held to reflected sound) externalize the interior contradiction. Emotions are sensorily grounded (“heartbeat keeping time with the quiet shiver”). The final renunciation of the restoration plan is earned by the garden’s audible questioning and the mural’s visible hand-lift. No second character, so relationship/status bullets N/A; interiority alone carries the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via echo-pattern (“between question and reply”) and held to the final Charged Poise: the hush after the wall’s exhalation reweights knowledge itself. Closure is the conceptual repricing of “certainty” into “curiosity,” cost felt in the narrator’s abandonment of professional protocol. Persistent constraint: the nickel stays warm, the garden keeps exhaling questions—tactics shift from restoration to co-creation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 8; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: ribs catch breath, traffic chords are folded into breathing, the nickel’s ripples echo the arches—environment actively constrains each scrape and clap. Micro-setting (the nickel’s “tiny sound waves frozen midflight”) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: scraper down → clap → stepped closer → grime flakes off. No weather clichés; all sensory detail is routed through the narrator’s restorer eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the wall exhales the question. One meaningful deepening: the painted woman’s hand lifts, foreclosing the original restoration goal; cost is the narrator’s professional certainty visibly forfeited. Agency is attentional (clap, listen, abandon plan) rather than combative; pressure accumulates via echoed sound and flaking pigment. No coincidence; escalation is lyric density increase under accretive lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the nested visuals—figures inside figures, doubts inside doubts—without once naming “epistemology.” The final image (“endless, vivid echoes”) reweights the opening soot-scraping as the first unsealing. Subtext hums in silence: the garden’s reply is never translated, only felt. No moralizing; the cost is the narrator’s surrender of expert mastery, made legible in the abandoned scraper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly a restorer’s: pigments are “nested awakenings,” arches are “stone ribs,” grime is “old convictions.” Syntax spirals like the mural—long breathy clauses that tighten into staccato beats (“I clapped once”). No head-hop; first-person stays inside sensorium. Diction never exceeds a painter’s lexicon; metaphor engine is internal and consistent. Rhythm mirrors echo mechanics, teaching the pattern early and paying off in the final line’s cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“Beneath sixty years of grime, figures slept inside figures, a whole city of nested awakenings” = time, visual, theme). No scaffold loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “epistemology” in commentary—stays within narrator’s reflective capacity. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm breathes with the garden.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The hobo-nickel-as-question-currency, the sound-garden-as-instrument, and the nested-mural-as-mind are syntheses that feel inevitable once revealed. Risk: lyric accretive structure replaces plot twists with echo-deepening, yet stakes tighten rather than dilute. Specificity anchors freshness—no generic “magical art” tropes; the carved nickel’s “ripples like tiny sound waves” is unrepeatable detail. Transformation test fails if relocated: the viaduct’s acoustic ribs are required for the final breathing image.</comment>
