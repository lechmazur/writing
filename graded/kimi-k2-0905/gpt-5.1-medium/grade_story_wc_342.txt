<comment>Mara’s face-blindness is dramatized through tactile ritual—fingertip shelf-reading, coin-reading by touch—so her flaw actively shapes tactics; the final “frame as gift” renunciation is foreshadowed by her earlier sky-painting ethic, so motivation holds. Interiority stays concrete (“light did not escape her”) and avoids label-speak. The missing .3 owes to no second character on-page to test status dynamics; within single-POV default that is not a demerit, but 9+ gate demands the full checklist.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the compressed-sky book becomes an Earned Stasis—Mara accepts the tree’s demolition by finishing the portable sky, cost felt in the “boards seemed ready to warp.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each painted stripe layers prior ceilings until pattern break (no more space) reweights stakes. Causality intact: coin-touch → finds secret safe → obtains blank book → paints final sky. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3. Cost legible in final image.</comment>

<comment>Tree-library is not backdrop but tool: shelf grain mirrors branch logic, dictates how Mara navigates by touch; demolition countdown supplies ticking clock that halts brush at exact moment of physical limit. Micro-setting (coin, boards, shelf spine) constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—smell of books, turpentine whiff, boards warping—mirrors internal pressure. Final image of compressed sky pages could not exist without fractal shelf geometry taught early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the sky—tightens when paint reaches board limit, forcing renunciation而非 rescue of walls. Agency: each brushstroke consumes dwindling space, literal cost (“boards seemed ready to warp”). No external reversals needed; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens. One micro-turn: realization “some limits were frames” crystallizes choice. Cost visible on-page, satisfying 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: limits (face-blindness, board edges, demolition clock) become gifts that force new creation. Final image reweights earlier skies—now portable, private—answering the thematic question “can sky be endless?” with paradoxical yes-because-framed. Subtext in coin’s ghost map: knowledge passed by touch, not sight. No moralizing; resonance carried by image of warped, sky-laden boards.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, yet stays within Mara’s perceptual lexicon—“light as language older than ink.” Rhythm modulates: long clauses for ceiling expanses, staccato fragments as horns intrude. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression like “turpentine clarity” teaches pattern early and pays off in final brush-halt. Filter verbs minimal; tactile verbs dominate (“uncapped,” “layered,” “warp”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences paint time, color, emotion (“violent purple she had used after a fire”). No synonym loops; each color noun is specific and unrepeated. Metaphors consistent (sky-as-language, coin-as-map) and physically grounded. Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesuras mimic breath between horn blasts. Final line “meet each person as new light on old ground” lands clean, no cadence template. Minor elevated diction (“primed boards”) justified by artist POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist + fractal tree library + compressible sky boards; trope of condemned building repurposed into meditation on framed infinity. Coin-map read by touch reverses typical treasure hunt. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with clear Charged Poise. Could not swap elements without breaking logic—sky must be painted, tree must be hollowed, face must be unreadable. Specificity anchors abstraction.</comment>
