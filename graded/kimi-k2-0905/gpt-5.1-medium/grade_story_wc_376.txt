<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s allergy to lies is vivid—hands tremble, gold crumples—so the trait drives every beat. The moment he chooses to open the rusted gate with the postal fragment, he risks direct exposure to the city’s withheld dishonesty; the cost is the sudden hush of stale ink-air that “smelled of long-delayed honesty,” a felt bodily price. Interiority stays concrete: he senses “unspoken warnings in the air” and equates withheld truth with breath stuck on a tongue, avoiding label-speak. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he steps inside knowing he may be overwhelmed, foreclosing the safety of his sealed studio—choice is earned and irreversible at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dried oasis → sealed city → map fragment → postal plate → observatory door clicks open; each beat narrows options. The map puzzle is dramatized on the warm floor, not summarized, supplying the required visible work. Closure is a Decisive Change: the gate opens, the city’s withheld breath is released, and Lio cannot retreat; the cost is the sensory assault of “stale ink and long-delayed honesty” that greets him. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“studio high above the condensation banks”) and never breaks; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Glass ribs, numbered leaves, and gold-veined vines are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Lio’s professional eye. The zinc plate’s corrosion is matched to humidity stains on the map, turning setting into evidence. The final image—the observatory exhaling “stale ink”—uses environment to body the stakes of stored speech, charging the closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost conversations—signals early and tightens when the map points to the sealed observatory, a single meaningful escalation. Agency is dramatized: Lio kneels, matches humidity stains, and decides to open the rusted gate; the click of the lock is the irreversible turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is on-page: the sour hush of bottled dishonesty hits his throat the instant the door unlatches. No coincidence resolves; storm only thickens backdrop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as civic oxygen—emerges through image, not statement: gold leaf stores honesty, vines wilt near lies, the city itself “holds its breath.” The observatory’s exhalation reweights every prior sealed corridor and numbered leaf; the reader feels the atmosphere change without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will Lio survive the flood of backlog deceit? The refusal to answer amplifies rather than blurs resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Lio’s shoulder, diction botanic-gilded (“condensation banks,” “gold shimmered storing words”) yet never purple. Rhythm accelerates during map reconstruction—short clauses mimic root toward water—then slows for the gate click. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to what he can see or infer. Voice remains distinct under pressure: “his throat constrict… not with fear, but with the sense that the city had been holding its breath.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “He matched humidity stains like puzzle edges and followed where the blue-green inks… still hinted at direction” advances action, reveals craft patience, and maintains sensory hook. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (ribs over streets, breath on tongue) appears once and earns its keep. Register stable—no sudden academic intrusion. Final paragraph varies cadence, letting the observatory’s exhalation land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines botanical calligraphy, lost-mail cartography, and toxic-sky greenhouse in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet unseen before. The “gold leaf as honest storage” and “wilting near lies” twist familiar bio-sensitivity into vocational stakes. Risk is taken: climax is a door opening and air smelling of ink—quiet, but the conceptual reprice (city must finally exhale its deceit) is undeniable. Without Lio’s specific guild the story collapses; transformation test passed.</comment>
