<comment>Elian’s secretly-sentimental trait is front-loaded (“folded scrap of childhood lullaby”) but never triggers a micro-choice with visible cost; the final three-degree lens twist is driven by breathing-sync, not the hidden lullaby. Interiority is lush yet stays safely poetic, never letting flawed irrationality complicate the experiment. The earned change lands as perceptual, not moral, so the absence of a concrete price tied to his sentimental pocket keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crystal’s petal-bloom reconfigures perception, and the cost is felt in “tears stung his eyes” while logic is still standing. Drive lens is lyric-accumulative; density and cadence tighten once rather than causal chain, satisfying the short-form rule. Orientation is secure by line 3; no teleporting props. The missing beat: we never see the lullaby’s scrap physically used or risked, so the sentimental set-up stays conceptually, not causally, paid off.</comment>

<comment>The orchard–waterfall–pool triad is not backdrop; spatial access shapes every beat—spray feeds the light corridor, pool surface dictates lens angle, branch geometry frames starling diffraction. The copper alembics and mirrored lenses are tactile tools whose positions are tracked beat-by-beat; the final lens twist is the fulcrum of closure. Micro-setting (crystal, flame ring) doubles as environment that literally rewrites perception. All 9+ quick-test boxes ticked: setting constrains tactic and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic vs. intuition—is signaled early and narrows to a single irrevocable lens adjustment. Escalation is accumulative: each paragraph adds density (mist, starlings, flame ring) until the rhythm itself becomes pressure. The cost is perceptual, not bodily, but still forecloses prior certainty: “that certainty feel thin as paper held to flame.” Meets short-form requirement of one meaningful tightening; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern—light refraction, frost, crystal—rather than thesis; the final reweighting is the gaze itself, not a moral. Subtext is carried in silence: the unopened lullaby whispers at sentiment but never speaks, creating understated irony. Avoids overt allegory; “touch of wonder” stays a chemical reaction, not capitalized abstraction. The ending’s quiet reconfiguration invites multiple readings without confusion.</comment>

<comment>Voice is saturated yet controlled: alchemist’s diction (“alembics,” “diffraction,” “equations”) braided with lyric cadence that mimics murmuration flight. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Elian’s scale-eyes and glove-touch. Filter verbs are absent; immediacy is cinematic. Rhythm deliberately surges and settles with the flock, payoff taught early and fulfilled in the lens pivot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off—waterfall prisms return as crystal petals, flame turns liquid without mixed-vehicle crash. Sentence variety is natural; no template cadence. One scaffold risk: “like equations…like an old rival” is consecutive simile, but the second serves closure reconfiguration, hence forgiven. No artifacts touch the final image; clarity remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy with differential geometry of starlings is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight; no prior orchard-murmuration stories carry this exact synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because closure remains legible under accumulative lens. Sentiment hidden in pocket rather than shown in action is the one derivative echo of standard “tough-guy-soft-center” trope, preventing 9+. Still, specific sensory triangulation (scent of petal-ice, taste of new-made air) lifts it above generic wonder templates.</comment>
