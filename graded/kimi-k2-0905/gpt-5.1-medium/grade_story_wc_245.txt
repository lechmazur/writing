<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orrin’s contradictory need to map others’ grief while refusing his own is embodied in every tactile beat; the final kneel-and-stay is earned because the ring’s inward pivot has been foreshadowed and paid for in cumulative emotional weight. No stock therapeutic labels—guilt is rendered as “rooms he had avoided.” Interiority stays strictly character-bound and blind-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern-of-rests melody reweights every prior voice-chord; cost is legible in the ring’s added heaviness and the silent clearing. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held without waver; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening—forest hum → single note trail → absolute silence—reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting that constrains navigation: the root-tangled hollow literally thins sound to transparency, forcing the final stance. Platinum ring’s temperature shifts act as embodied barometer, charging the closing image. Selective detail (sap-slow grammar, staccato insects) stays inside Orrin’s haptic POV; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map uncharted emotional depths—signaled in paragraph 5 and deepened when each musical note becomes a voiced absence. Ring’s inward reorientation is the single decisive tightening that forecloses external quest. Cost is visible (ring weight, silent clearing); no coincidence resolves the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mapping the unmappable emerges through patterned sensory recursion: every surface “drunk” by skin later returns as unvoiced rests. Final “stay” reframes cartography as internal acceptance without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: forgiveness is possible, not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect texture mirrors Orrin’s haptic cognition: syntax lengthens with sap, shortens with insect staccato. Ultrasonic “bright needles” and ring’s slow blaze are neologisms born of blind perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and rhythmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary from liquid long beats to single-note fragments, accelerating with the note-trail. No loops, no filler filters; “languages lived in those surfaces” does triple sensory work. One mixed metaphor risk—“silence pressed like cool hands”—is saved by tactile POV consistency. Otherwise pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker who charts emotional topography via ultrasonic forest and inverse-music dowse is a fresh synthesis; trope of magical compass is inverted to point inward. Conceptual risk—story told through patterned rests—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity makes the premise unreproducible: remove any core element and the fabric tears.</comment>
