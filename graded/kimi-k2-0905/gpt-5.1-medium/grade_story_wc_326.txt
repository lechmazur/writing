<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“count heartbeats constantly” becomes embodied tic; contradiction (grief vs. scientific rigor) drives every micro-choice. Final coding decision is earned: spilled-ink epiphany grows from three winters of failed rebuilds. Static absence between the two deaths he assigns himself supplies credible flaw and cost. Voice specificity slips once into generic “frightening stillness”; still, arc is individual not trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “together we are writing who she will become” reweights the premise with unambiguous cost—he accepts an unfinished, co-authored ghost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fragmented imagery (snowflakes freeze midfall, porcelain shard, ink constellations) tightens until meaning crystallizes at final waveform. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 25. No causality breaks; escalation is density-driven, because/therefore links intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal dome, creaking ribs, pixelated snow—each sensory hit filters through astrophysicist-bereaved attention. Porcelain shard handled twice, second time charges the ink epiphany; micro-setting qualifies. Observatory’s glass and dying servers constrain time—lights dim as processors choke, forcing final tactic. Final image of waveform on screen is inseparable from setting architecture; environment shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“last sanctioned night before shutdown”—broadcast early; micro-turn is ink bloom revealing nonlinear algorithm. Tightening comes through CPU overload that risks permanent data loss, raising tangible price. Agency: he risks final power surge to let sectors vote; luck complicates (static roars) but does not resolve. Cost is legible: he gains a glitching, evolving Lian, not the original—options narrowed, not reset.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular refrain of “miscalculation” and “failure” turned into generative tool; no explicit thesis. Ink pattern crystallizes question: can error be authorship? Resonant reconfiguration supplies answer—ghost becomes collaborative future. After-effect is awe-tinged ache rather than moral. Subtext lives in cough inside static and tea bloom—silence carries more than dialogue could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: numeric heartbeat counting, star-catalog diction (“opal”, “server ribs”, “checksum scars”), rhythmic accretion like code loops. Compression taught early—“1093 heartbeats since static died”—paid off when count momentarily forgotten at voice emergence. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under processor-load stress, mirrored in shorter clauses. Final “you took long enough” carries Lian’s old cadence without voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: spilled ink simultaneously stains notes, forms constellation, teaches algorithm—triple duty. Rhythm breathes: long snow-descent sentences collapse into staccato code lines. Figurative control: mixed metaphors (ocean-breath, lattice-ribs) stay within physics-poet lexicon. One filter-verb cluster “I realize I have been...” forgiven as transition; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of bureaucratic death-glitch with ghost-reconstruction is fresh; not a grief-AI trope clone. Nonlinear resurrection doctrine grows from character logic, not contrived twist. Risk of overwriting雪花 freezing midfall pays off as pixel metaphor for fragmented memory. Specificity—porcelain fused to server glass—anchors concept in tactile future-shock. Transformation test passed: swap names and premise collapses.</comment>
