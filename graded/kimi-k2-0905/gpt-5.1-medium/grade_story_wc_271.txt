<comment>Mariam’s interiority is rich and embodied—tremor, shoulder ache, freeze response—each somatic cue particular to her past and present stakes. The contradictory impulse to map futures yet expect none is dramatized in the micro-choice of folding the photo into the notebook rather than discarding it. The “pearl of stillness” is credible renunciation with cost: she keeps the ruinous memory in reach yet chooses to write toward tomorrow. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; solo arc fully earned.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared via salt-fog density and photo-creases accumulating toward the Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) secured by line 3, lighthouse keeper echo closing the frame. Single scene, no teleport props; causality intact—photo folds because memory cannot be discarded. Closure: notebook page accepts folded ruin, re-configuring hope with undeniable cost—she still carries the blur of the bride.</comment>

<comment>Arboretum-as-body: glass corridors breathe, fig leaf veins mirror henna lace, salt fog condenses on metal bench—each tactile detail filters through traumatized attention. Micro-setting (numbered wristband) constrains airspace and choice, charging safety. Spatial choreography clean: tram, cliff, seawall cracks remain consistent. Final image of “steady feet” under empty lighthouse tower re-weights setting as witness, not scenic postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she re-enter future without denying massacre—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each sensory trigger (gull dive, drone memory) tightens the somatic vise; the folding of the photo is the single decisive compression that forecloses erasure. Cost visible: she keeps the blur of catastrophe inside her new script. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges concretely: beauty does not shield, yet survival can still choose inscription. Subtext lives in folded photo—artifact of both laughter and shriek—its creases now pages for tomorrow’s ink. No sermon; final image offers resonant re-pricing: optimism purchased at cost of carrying blurred bride forever. Complex ambiguity maintained—hope and wreckage “sit side by side like rocks in the tide.”</comment>

<comment>Third-person immersive sustains lyric compression without filter-verb clutter. Diction—“salt fog slid,” “chewed black rocks,” “pearl sanded down”—is character-specific to a henna artist who reads veins like maps. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror fog density; short beats (“she froze”) mimic cardiac jolt. No head-hop, no register drift; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors consistent—ocean patience as grinding teeth, stillness as pearl—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Minor elevated register (“arboretum perched”) justified by POV’s artistic eye. Final line cadence resolves with echo of “kept its own counsel,” satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of drone-strike survivor with seaside plant conservatory feels fresh; horticultural reach toward absent lighthouse light parallels survivor’s reach toward absent guests. Henna-artist hands turned tremor-mapper offers occupational specificity rarely seen. Risk taken in quiet Charged Poise ending pays off. Slight ding for familiar “wedding drone mistake” premise, but angle of body-as-map and stillness-as-pearl transforms it.</comment>
