<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is concrete—his “quiet miracle” of 712 returns, his priest-like caretaking—but contradictory impulses arrive late and stay verbal (“he might merge parallel timelines”). The final “he chose home” is decisive yet un-earned; we haven’t seen him weigh any competing choice or fear, so the cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrative layers sensory and metaphysical repetitions (radio braid, ferry disappearances, mirrored grotto) until a Charged Poise re-weights the premise. Closure lands cleanly—Eli’s single clear note aimed at absence crystallizes the possibility of plaited permanence—but the cost is conceptual rather than embodied; the story tells us “he chose home” without on-page consequence or forfeiture, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective, urgent detail—“boards shone like wet moonlight,” “static like a nest of metal bees,” “grotto…mapped glow of subway routes, nerve fibers, and constellations”—anchors the metaphysical frame in tactile objects. The hourglass, radio, and ferry itself act as micro-settings that constrain Eli’s final tuning action, directly charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early: Eli wants to steer the ferry toward a merged, permanent morning. Pressure escalates texturally—fog thickens from “unsaid possibilities,” stars trade places, reflections of burning or wedding ferries overlap—until the braided melody forces a one-shot stance. The tightening is felt, but the price (what Eli actually forfeits if the merger fails) stays off-page, capping tension just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: transit as existential rehearsal, the ache of permanent transience. The hourglass of invisible sand reweights time as possibility rather than duration; the grotto of overlapping ferries makes the civic commute a cosmic fork. Resonance is strong, but the final “he chose home” leans slightly toward moral convenience—no visible cost darkens the epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“clocks run sideways”) and paid off in star-swapping and radio braid. Syntax mirrors transit rhythm—“the city lights drew backward like a curtain”—with no scaffolding or monotony. Focalization stays tight: Eli hears melody where others hear static, creating a perceptual signature that remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line can set, evoke, and advance (“a low arch of rock…spectral grotto under starlight suspended where no land had ever been”). Figurative layering is controlled; only in the grotto stack do three metaphors co-exist, justified by the reality-overlay concept. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with paragraph variance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The vanishing commuter ferry as liminal parish, the hourglass measuring ungrains of possibility, and the radio braid as steering grid synthesize metaphysical transit with tactile maritime labor. The risk—lyric density that could drown in whimsy—pays off because every image constrains Eli’s final action. The synthesis feels inevitable, not ornamental; speculative imagery grows from character need rather than checklist quirk.</comment>
