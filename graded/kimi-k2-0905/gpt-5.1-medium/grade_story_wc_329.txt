<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory desire to awaken beauty while fearing the orchard’s call is clear; his micro-decision to bow-stroke the orchard’s pulse, not the city’s, is dramatized on the page. The final renunciation—stepping onto the bough without stopping the music—carries visible cost (arms aching, locust shell clinging as ghost-coda). Interiority stays concrete (“taste of years,” “soil and sorrow”) rather than diagnostic. Only minor stutter: we never see how the fear of losing daily bread actually felt minute-to-minute, so the risk stays slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lio stands on the rising branch, music still flowing, machines dark, city in vertigo—felt cost is unmistakable (“bruised velvet dome over metal skeletons”). Causal chain is intact: locust shell → heard orchard pulse → bow-matched rhythm → copper harness snaps → statues leaf. Lens holds (Causal). Orientation complete at sentence 3; no drift. Single elastic scene; one transition (sky-bridge to bough) is legible and part of the final image. No telegraphing, no amnesia, no soft reset. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sky-bridge, cracked violin, locust shell, and sap-slick bronze each constrain choices and charge the final image. Iron flakes as “snow,” emerald runes in stone eyes, and “sap-slick trunks” are selective, POV-filtered specifics that mirror interior thaw. Tactile lived-in navigation: Lio touches shell with back of finger, steps onto bough, feels leaves brush ankles. Spatial choreography clean; distance from bridge to orchard and mechanical city stays consistent. Micro-setting objects (violin, shell) function as geography that alters tactics. No filler exposition; every detail either pressures choice or re-weights at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. keep city calm—tightens when Lio realizes his music is a key he has blunted. Escalation is single but meaningful: switching rhythm from city to orchard irrevocably snaps copper harnesses and blacks out towers; price is legible (machinists clutch chests, Lio’s arms burn). Because/therefore linkage under Causal lens: because he bows orchard pulse, therefore roots rip free. No coin-flip resolution; the choice is his, irreversible. Could touch 9.0 if we felt one personal concrete loss (friend? ration card?) but citywide blackout already carries social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty as insurgent vegetal intelligence vs. mechanized control. Subtext in gesture—statues “remembering,” machinists’ puzzled chest-clutch—carries the political cost. Final image of musician lifted on branch while machines stay dark offers resonant non-moral answer. No tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers about who will feed the city. Locust shell works as re-weighting motif (emptiness sings) rather than symbol harvested late. Only minor wobble: “uproot us” whisper risks faint slogan echo, quickly offset by soil-taste specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Lio; perceptual signature vivid (“taste of years,” “lines so resonantly soft that even the lowest gears seemed to hesitate”). Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed fragments in blackout beat. No head-hop, no explanatory overreach. Violin and locust shell act as extensions of his attention. Register stays within plausible artisan-musician diction; “conceptual repricing” and “resonant reconfiguration” never appear. Rhythm mirrors emotional arc: languid dusk opening → staccato root-snaps → lifted legato close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Zero loops, no synonym churn. Sentences multi-task: “branches … clawed impatiently at the clouded sky” shows violence and vegetal yearning simultaneously. Metaphor chain (iron-snow, serpent-lines, ghost-coda) stays coherent; each vehicle extends world rule. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with escalation. No filter-verb stacks, no purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“lifted him as easily as a thought finally admitted”) lands with image that recharges prior music-as-thought motif. Copy-clean: pronoun, tense, punctuation precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Fusion of eco-insurgency + violin-as-key + locust-shell-catalyst feels inevitable in hindsight, not bolted on. Transformative inversion: orchard was never backdrop but sleeping protagonist; statues are self-policing trees. Specific detours—bronze faces blooming bark, power lines whipping like liberated serpents—could not swap into another tale. Risk in lyric causal chain pays off: music → root snap → city blackout accepted because sensory wiring prepared reader. Emotional specificity (soil-taste, ache in arms) anchors conceptual boldness. No allegorical stand-ins, no safety hedging.</comment>
