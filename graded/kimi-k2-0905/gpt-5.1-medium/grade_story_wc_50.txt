<comment>The locksmith’s interiority is rich—his “peripherally focused” nature shapes every micro-choice (mirror angles, oblique gaze at spinning light). Contradictory impulses (urgency to save wonder vs. fear of direct stare) coil inside single beats, culminating in the earned, quiet renunciation of “looking directly.” Cost is felt: he leaves the cavern having traded immediate certainty for a reservoir of indirect awe. The absence of any second character keeps relationship/status bullets inactive, but single-POV depth fully satisfies.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final silence feels “crowded, softly luminous,” reconfiguring the city’s future access to wonder. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mirror adjustment and whispered question thickens the echo-density until the timer’s wheel becomes a prism that reweights memory itself. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“spiral stairs… marble cavern”). Cost is unmistakable: the locksmith forfeits immediate auditory harvest for a fragile, angle-dependent archive—he “closed the case” knowing its access is now oblique forever.</comment>

<comment>The cavern’s scarred marble and mineral veins are not backdrop but tooling surfaces—chalk lines and mirror beams physically redirect sound/light, constraining how the timer can be mended. Micro-setting (the flattened pillar, wet hush) doubles as workbench and resonating chamber, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the POV: metallic tang, mineral cold, lantern fracturing into “slender beams” mirror his peripherally focused perception. Weather is internalized as “wounded season,” a temporal climate that affects civic attention rather than literal temperature—plausible and specific.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore the city’s capacity to “borrow awe”—is signaled in paragraph 9. Escalation is textural: each echo harvested tightens the cavern’s acoustic web until silence itself becomes luminous pressure. No antagonist is needed; the risk is existential flattening. The decisive deepening occurs when the locksmith chooses a mirror-polished hub instead of a new spring, trading reliability for contingent wonder—on-page cost is the timer’s future fragility.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not stored data but angled resonance—wonder survives only when approached sideways. The motif of “angles themselves, a geometric hush” reweights at closure: the city will now access echoes only through indirect attention. No moral is asserted; the final image of a crowded silence invites reflection on civic thinning. Subtext operates in gesture (refusal to look straight at light) and tool-choice (mirror-hub), making the conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained lyric third-person close: syntax lengthens and breathes with cavern humidity (“moist air pressed… old rain”). Perceptual signature is obsessively peripheral—light is caught “sideways,” wonder “arrives sideways,” vision kept “askew.” No dialogue, so naturalism bullets are idle. Purposeful compression (“a geometric hush”) teaches the reader to trust patterned elision; payoff is the final luminous silence that needs no exposition.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from cavernous long clauses to tight clicks (“soft click”). Metaphors are internally coherent (spring “coiled like a question,” gears “twitched like a dreaming animal”) and never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each description adds a new functional detail (chalk lines, mirror flashes). Information density is high—one sentence can layer sensory cue, tool action, and emotional pressure.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of acoustics, horology, and epistemic philosophy feels fresh yet inevitable: a locksmith who picks temporal locks by tuning echo-angles. Risk—700-word single-scene lyric accumulative—is fully realized; the piece would collapse if transplanted to generic workshop or scientist. Image of mirror-hub replacing spring is a non-obvious inflection that later charges closure. No borrowed lines or stock scenes; specificity (“lantern flame fractured into slender beams”) renders concept un-stealable.</comment>
