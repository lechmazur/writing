<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s listening obsession is embodied in soot-black fingers and humming ribs; the choice to stay and “listen until the walls finished dreaming” crystallizes a renunciation with cost. Inherited compulsion feels lived-in because micro-choices—rewinding the film canister, redrawing the map—track a hierarchy that prizes acoustic legacy over safety. Interior contradiction pulses: awe against dread, solitude against communion. No head-hop, no label-speak; the final stance is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sonic layer thickens until the diaries and film reweight the stake from mere survey to custodianship. The “conscious node” moment is a Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly forecloses walking away. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. Closure carries conceptual cost: the corridor exhales, relieved, and the narrator accepts perpetual servitude. Persistent constraint—the film canister now in pocket—shapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and sooty hearth operate as micro-settings that constrain access and dictate the discovery sequence; the blistered fire door must be pried, ivy must be cut. Sound itself becomes a tactile environment tasted as wet stone. Sensory hierarchy privileges echo over sight, mirroring the POV’s professional bias. Final image—corridor exhaling—recharges the ivy, hearth, and film as one living archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator answer the walls’ invitation?—tightens when the film negative proves prior failure, narrowing options to flee or inherit. Escalation is textural: each acoustic layer raises the cost of abandonment. The decisive turn is the narrator’s choice to redraw the map; this act forecloses future detachment. Price is felt: eternal auditory vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as patina: memory is not owned but custodied, and listening is a form of submission. Subtext hums in the corridor’s exhalation—buildings breathe only when someone risks being consumed. No explicit moral; the final image reweights prior motifs (ivy, film, soot) into a living covenant. Ambiguity lingers: is the narrator priest or prisoner?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person lyric texture sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence that mirrors echo decay. Diction—“sound pressed thin as spider silk,” “corridors upon corridors receding”—remains within a cartographer-poet lexicon. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from surveyor to servant under peak pressure. The rhythm’s controlled breath matches the building’s own, fusing voice to premise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I set my recorder on the floor, closed my eyes, and hummed” does three jobs in fourteen words. One paraphrase loop—“legacy’s burden pressed down… this was legacy’s burden”—clips an otherwise flawless run; the repetition is minor but audible. Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The corridor-echo-cartographer premise is fresh, yet the story’s deeper risk is treating acoustics as secular sacrament. Mara's film negative and the narrator’s map inversion feel inevitable in hindsight, not engineered. Specificity—ivy taste, soot bloom, recorder hum—anchors the conceit so it cannot be relocated. The risk heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity; originality arises from sensory obsession made sacred.</comment>
