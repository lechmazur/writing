<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ilya's interior contradiction—obedience to the future-dispatch yet refusal to fossilize memory—drives every beat; the ruby-press into the stair is a micro-choice that visibly costs him the throne, earning renunciation with embodied tremor. Flaws (curatorial caution vs adventurous sprint) complicate ascent and foreclose governance, satisfying earned-stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as conceptual repricing: by embedding the ruby he dissolves the throne, re-weighting humanity’s right to imperfect memory; countdown constellations provide persistent constraint, cost on-page. Causal linkage holds—because he peels murals he finds ruby, therefore he can sabotage the throne—lens stays causal without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsolete-satellite snow, citrus-ozone water, and hour-glass fruits are sensually concrete; orchard’s camera-trees and translucent OS-steps function as micro-setting that literally constrain footing and record choice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across waterfall → orchard → chapel → stair is immaculate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truthful memory vs perfect grid”—tightens via sunrise countdown that deletes possibility; each peeled layer raises cost of losing unedited past. Agency visible: pressing ruby into stair trades sovereign power for collective imperfection, price felt immediately under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-flawed-life emerges through peeling paint strata and startup-chime stairs; no editorializing, only image. Final image—throneless sunrise—reconfigures premise that governance requires fixed narrative, offering resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains consistent perceptual bias—data-center citrus, archival-band glow—without filter clutter. Lyric compressions (“fossilized circuit boards like technological snow”) teach pattern early and repay at climax; no head-hopping, diction stays within technologist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, high-density lines (“kaleidoscopic waterfall roared, each droplet refracting archived advertisements”) advance three jobs at once. Metaphors are coherent (OS-steps whisper startup chimes) and peak beat remains clear; sentence rhythm accelerates with ascent, no scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of data-loss mythology with medieval throne-quest feels inevitable; “memory as ascending operating systems” freshes familiar climb. Risk of dissolving throne at climax heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity of obsolete media snow makes trope feel singular.</comment>
