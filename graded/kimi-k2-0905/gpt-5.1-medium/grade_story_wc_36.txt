<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cael’s guilt-riven solitude is viscerally embodied—every breath an intrusion, the flute “heavier…than he remembered.” The interior contradiction—duty to keep the bridge open vs. need to hear the mute instrument—drives every micro-choice from silk-unwrapping to the final imperfect note. The renunciation of performative mastery for humble listening is fully earned; the cost is the lifelong stone of failure he will keep breathing. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: silence and stone density increase until the single frayed note reweights everything. Orientation is immediate; causality is interior—because the flute choked, therefore Cael seeks its mute wisdom. Closure is a Charged Poise: the amphitheater holds the imperfect sound as new bridge, with felt cost in the open-ended “path weaving between worlds inside himself.” No artifact obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo Range is not backdrop but active pressure: sound-swallowing snow, bowl of stone that folds every word. Driftwood markers and sun-faded silk are micro-settings handled with tactile care; the worn finger-holes of the flute literally constrain what note can emerge. Environment forces Cael’s shift from ritual demand to listening stance. Final image charges the same stone walls with the new, imperfect music.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Cael renegotiate his failure into meaning? Pressure tightens when he realizes the flute was never asked but only commanded; the single deepening is enough. Agency is interior—he risks the imperfect note instead of silence. Cost is the permanent loss of certainty; the bridge remains closed yet a new inner path opens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: duty deaf to dialogue becomes reciprocal listening. The gilded reed’s dulling from bright to “old honey” reprises the shift without moralizing. Final image of a frayed thread touching stone, sky, ribs offers resonant non-literal answer—meaning is not mastery but imperfect offering. No thematic echo, no final moral, only charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Cael’s perceptual filter: wind “like a note remembering its own birth.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with his hesitation, then compresses into the single frayed note. No dialogue, so those bullets N/A. Prose texture is distinct—“avalanchingly quiet” coinage feels earned by stone amphitheater context, not gimmick.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances silence or sound. Metaphors are coherent—stone folds words, flute is dragonfly-old. Information density high: silk, latch, finger-hole, honey color each do double duty as memory and tactile present. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to staccato hinge-clicks, mirroring breath before note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-for-meaning after failure is re-framed through acoustics: a keeper who must learn to listen to his own relic. Soundless canyon as confessional is fresh; imperfect single note as closure resists triumph or despair. Risk taken—entire story hinges on internal audition—pays off with crystalline specificity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
