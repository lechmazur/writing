<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s curiosity is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—chalk transfers, notebook overlays, whispered square-counting—each tightening the risk ladder. Interior contradiction appears when awe competes with the fear of being “dashed against a mountain,” keeping emotional calibration honest. The final stance crystallizes: Lio accepts sole risk-logging authority, a visible cost that forecloses the apprentice’s safe anonymity. Voice stays particular to a star-drunk map-nerd; no competence overruns genuine precarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: starling light-pools accrue until they re-weight the meaning of play lines, producing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is secured inside 120 words via dusk, airship deck, and apprentice task. One tight transition—below deck—keeps continuity; hopscotch board becomes causal instrument, not prop. Closure lands as charged poise: corridor of clear sky opens because Lio’s choreography forced it, cost felt in crew’s unseen but listening presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Antique airship and starling murmurations are not mere backdrop; their physical interaction—spirals folding into a corridor—literally clears the route. The chalk board micro-setting anchors every beat; hull planks, dust, stray photons constrain how evidence can be gathered. Sensory hierarchy obeys a cartographer’s bias: light angle, flock density, plank vibration over sound or scent. Final image re-uses these setting elements to charge the sky-corridor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove “stranded luminance” real before authority—tightens when Orvan demands risk-proof; refusal would abort Lio’s only chance. Escalation is textural: each square-glow note thickens pattern evidence until it outweighs scheduled flight plans. One visible price: Lio’s hands smudged, heart “loose rigging,” and explicit acceptance of personal risk-logging duty. No coincidence resolves; starlings merely respond to invisible choreography, pressure stays coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—maps as living choreography, not static geometry—emerges through hopscotch traversal and avian call-response, never named aloud. Subtext silences: crew listening through floorboards implies science born from child-play, undercutting adult certainty. No moralizing caps the piece; final corridor invites reader to rethink borders as negotiable performance. Emotional aftereffect lingers: wonder at play becoming instrument of discovery, with risk acknowledged but not neutralized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from librarianship, ink, margins, stamps, reflecting map-apprentice cognition. Rhythm swells and contracts with discovery beats; short clauses mimic hop-hop-pause of play. Compression (“murmur of the crew…friendly, muffled weather”) teaches reader to accept synesthetic shorthand early; closure keeps same texture. No register drift; diction stays within starlight-cartography lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line often does three jobs—advance, characterize, worldbuild (“starling murmurations that stitched and unstitched the air”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (ink, shelves, hopscotch) recur coherently. No filler loops; each paragraph cut test passes—remove any and explanatory logic frays. Rhythm varies; no template cadence detected in peak beat where corridor opens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: avian photonics + hopscotch divination collapses celestial navigation into playground ritual, an angle not templated in familiar steampunk. Strategic risk—letting birds steer the ship via chalk graffiti—pays off narratively and thematically. Specificity of “square three glow” versus generic light keeps invention grounded. Transformation test fails if elements swapped: hopscotch, starlings, map logic are inextricable to climax.</comment>
