<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The scavenger’s compulsive collection of stolen voices is vividly embodied—salt-crusted fingers, pocketing the camera wheel—so his erosion feels tactile. Yet the interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized: “resolve is what remains when better things erode” is a thesis, not a beat. The micro-choice to hand the wheel to the ghost carries cost, but the prior beats are accumulative summary rather than scene-pressure. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature and the final hollowing of self keep this in high-band territory.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost, now crowded with faint overlapping selves, reweights the premise—borrowed lives cannot fill the absence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of echo-objects increases until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is taught early (“after the carousel halts”) and pays off in the slowing music memory. The causal chain is interior but legible: hoarded fragments → ghostly confrontation → forfeiture of self-outline. Cost is on-page: “they weigh more than I can bear, and less than I once believed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon—mirrored gears, clockwork gulls—functions as micro-setting that directly constrains movement and metaphor; the skiff is literally built from carousel detritus, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: the narrator notices ticking wings, brass lungs, salt crust, all filtered through scavenger bias. Spatial choreography is clean: edge → shallows → center, with distance tracked by oar-strokes. The world rules remain internally consistent—gears turn clouds, music sinks—without exposition dump. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can borrowed stories replace an eroded life?—is signaled early and tightens once: the offer of scavenged relics to the ghost. Agency is renunciation rather than decision; the path foreclosed is the illusion that fragments can constitute a self. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged object adds density until the ghost’s silent verdict reweights the stake. Cost is visible—pocketed wheel surrendered, outline emptied into ghost-frame—under the Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the deepening of burden satisfies the single-turn requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific image pattern: circular objects—camera wheel, carousel, lagoon gears—echo the narrator’s own circular avoidance. Subtext operates in gesture: handing over the wheel is confession without apology. The final image reframes prior scavenging as self-cannibalization, avoiding moral statement. Ambiguity lingers: is the ghost fuller or is the narrator hollower? The answer is felt, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct scavenger lexicon—“brass lungs,” “sky-dust,” “constellations of flaked paint”—that stays consistent under pressure. Rhythm compresses in the skiff: short, oar-stroke sentences mimic breath. Unreliable memory is cued early (“chronologically confused”) and paid off in the fogged negatives. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is avoided. Patterned repetition—“turning,” “eroded,” “carousel”—is taught early and recharged in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are dense but purposeful—lagoon as skin of mirrored gears—tied to POV’s mechanical obsession. One paraphrase loop: “They call me a resolute scavenger, but resolve is only what remains…” restates the same idea; minor deduction. No register drift; diction stays within scavenger’s plausible lexicon. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the circular motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—afterlife scavenger bartering stolen stories to negotiate with his own ghost—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Carousel-as-metaphor for avoidance is fresh, not stock. Risk of opacity is taken but paid off: the lagoon’s physics is taught early, so closure remains legible. Specific detail—“ticket stubs blurred with mist,” “paper crown softened into pulp”—prevents abstraction. The synthesis of appropriated voices into hollow self-portrait feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
