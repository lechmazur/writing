<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prince’s yearning for wings is vivid and embodied (“bedraggled prince of rust”); his refusal to smelt the egg is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is strong, but the moment of memory-transfer (“seared through him”) leans toward unearned epiphany rather than gradual, earned contradiction. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: duty vs. beauty, chosen at visible personal risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: egg discovery → memory → refusal → vigil; each beat tightens options under a single lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the redirected sunlight and “crack of a new dawn” reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost—his throne, his safety, the world’s logic. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image; persistent constraint (palace/industry) still looms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selectively textured: “piston blossoms and iron rivers” compresses world and theme in one breath. Stalactites-as-teeth and corroded throne constrain the prince’s mobility and echo his fragility. Micro-setting (egg, observatory floor) is handled tactually, charging the final image. Mirror-redirected sunlight is environment-as-tool that enables the closing vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanized order—is signaled early and tightens once: the egg forces a binary choice at court. Escalation is driven by his agency; syndicate backlash is implied, not yet visited, but cost is already felt in his abdication of propaganda duty. No false coincidence. Persistent constraint (industrial empire) remains, sharpening stakes for future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: extinct wing vs. iron river, egg vs. Continuum Engine. Final image answers the central question—can beauty reboot a mechanized world?—without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture (courier’s shaking hands, prince’s weak knees). Bitter-sweetness is lived, not labeled; ambiguity lingers (will the hatchling survive?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, metallic, yet lyrical; syntax mirrors mechanized world (“gears simulating a flawed genesis”). Perceptual signature is prince-specific: every noun is filtered through rust, cables, efficiency. No head-hopping; distance stable. Compression taught early (“theories now, and museum sketches”) and paid off in final “crack of a new dawn.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths modulate from drum-beat fragments to elongated coils. High information density—each line advances image, world, and theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not story text; text itself avoids such meta-terms. Metaphors are consistent (industrial = garden) and physically coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk palace + de-extinction egg + ad-campaign-for-nature. Familiar eco-parable is retooled through extinct bird as living ad that bankrupts its own billboard. Risk is taken—quiet vigil rather than escape chase—and coherence holds. Specific detail (“egg the color of old moonlight”) prevents swap-out with generic artifact.</comment>
