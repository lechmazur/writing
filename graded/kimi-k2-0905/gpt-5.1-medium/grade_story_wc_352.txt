<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archivist’s split-mind training and “prism-minded” perception are shown through how he deciphers the doodle and endures threshold effects; interiority stays sensory, not abstract. Choices—pressing palm, breathing through layers, offering pulse to chains—are micro-costed and drive beats. No second character, so relationship crucible N/A; the sole flaw is no visible flaw: competence feels absolute, muting jeopardy. Still, a credible endurance with cost is earned: he absorbs world-shielding combinations that now live behind his eyes, foreclosing future ignorance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the codex imprinting “watchful stars” into memory visibly reprices his agency and the world’s safeguards. Causal chain holds: inversion hour → wall thins → doodle unfolds → chains test → book loads → hour ends. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. One minor scaffold: “seeds of vigilance” is named twice before we see one act—costs a breath of immediacy but doesn’t break lens. Accum/Textural lens valid; density tighten from motes to chained lightning charges stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, tool trifecta: the eastern wall’s changing thickness, the archivist’s gloved palm/heartbeat, and the calcified-ink chain literally constrain access and final image. Sensory hierarchy follows his profession—dust weight, ink breath, stone sound—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we trace upward drift across veils, juts, hovering shelves without a single impossible placement. Luminous fog refusing inversion is the specific that elevates from vivid to choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—secure forbidden combinations before gravity reverts—signaled early; hourglass pressure tightens every paragraph. One meaningful deepening: chains actively read his pulse, forcing him to bank curiosity against cruelty; visible price is the codex’s neural load that “presses against his skull.” Agency sits with attention and breath discipline; no lucky rescue. Cost is legible, but because he never truly risks failure, the tightening feels foreordained rather than razor-narrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as knowledge custodianship versus usable danger: patterns safeguard by hiding inside beauty (doodle) and pain (training). Subtext carried in silence: no spoken words, only pulse negotiation with chains—power spoken through biology. Final image of “watchful stars” behind eyes reweights prior “seeds of vigilance” without moral statement. Complexity acknowledged—world-protection includes mercy for beasts and fog for tyrants—yet stays implicit, letting configurations speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains psychic distance; perceptual signature is crystalline yet pressurized—“stone felt thinner than thought,” “inkpots lightened.” Syntax lengthens during drift, fragments under chain-test, matching physiological stress. No dialogue, so dialogue criteria waived. Free indirect blends seamlessly: “gravity tugging sideways as if trying to peer” stays inside his sensorium. Diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon; no head-hop, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for glide, staccato for chain assessment, final calm closure. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent—chains as “calcified ink,” fog as “luminous membranes.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” cognate phrasing approaches academic, but localized and voice-motivated. High density—every clause layers new world-rule or sensory data—propels rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy library-inversion heist feels novel yet inevitable; doodle-as-map and pulse-reading chains are specific inventions, not trope checkboxes. Conceptual commitment full: gravity invert, mist strata, memory liquefaction all followed to logical sensory end. Risk—lyric density without dialogue—pays off by keeping focus on cerebral trespass. Transformation test fails if renamed: the prism-gaze and chained vigilance are inseparable from this exact text. Minor echo of Borges/“The Library” but inverted into bodily heist, sufficiently transformed.</comment>
