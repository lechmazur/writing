<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s withered-body-as-landscape is sustained through tactile micro-choices (tasting soil, knuckles knotting into bark). His pragmatic streak turns the prognosis into on-page action—pruning, polishing, planting—so the “wise” tag earns its keep. Interior contradiction is light; we’re told he’s pragmatic rather than shown him doubting the ritual he invents. Still, the final image of him rolling a marble to “test” luck crystallizes a credibly earned stance with visible cost: his own woodening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the maze “answers” Elias via a living pulse that mirrors his own, re-weighting the premise that only data counts. Causality holds: each commemorative act (wind-chime, dusk-scented flower) is traceable to a visitor smile he witnessed earlier. The reflective passages stay anchored to present-tense stimuli (marble polishing, hedge trimming) and tilt his next micro-choice. No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive within the first 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden maze is not postcard scenery; its leaning hedges and scent-schedule constrain Elias’s tactics and supply the final image’s “question mark” curvature. The cracked marbles act as micro-setting: their fractures decide how light refracts and therefore how Elias reads portents. Spatial choreography is spotless—visitors enter, exit, leave emotional residue that he maps onto soil and plant. One pinch of specificity short of 9.0: we’re never shown how the public fortune screens physically interface with the maze border.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens can outrank algorithmic luck—tightens once: the polished marbles begin to “choose” thriving patches, foreclosing his skepticism. Escalation is textural rather than causal: visitor smiles accumulate density until the maze literally pulses back at him. Visible price is present (hands woodening, nights spent polishing), but the external world never pushes back hard—no official threatens closure, no tech tries to quantify his garden. Sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper cost required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the story reframes “mended deception” from fraud to collaborative act—garden, gardener, and stranger conspire to believe. Subtext sits in gesture: hanging keys where a child laughed is a quiet sermon on shared fabrication. Final image reweights earlier material by converting the maze into a living punctuation mark, avoiding tidy moral. One decimal off 9.0 because the city’s data-religion is sketched so broadly that its ideological collapse feels assumed rather than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual bias—soil taste, hedge lean, marble refraction—creating a consistent syntactic pulse of participle-built clauses that mimic vines. No head-hopping; even visitor smiles are filtered through his interpretation. Register stays within an aged gardener’s diction; no academic drift. Occasional metaphor density (“tired bureaucrats” for hedges) is earned by earlier pattern, paid off when hedges literally lean toward him.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long arboreal sentences to curt bark-laugh clauses, propelling without algorithmic pattern. Information density high: one sentence often layers tool-action, bodily change, and luck philosophy. No scaffold loops; each commemorative act is fresh detail rather than paraphrase. Metaphors stay internally consistent—no mixed vehicles. Closing image lands clean, uncluttered by late verbosity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “measurable luck” frame is familiar from Black-Mirror episodes, but the inversion—garden as unmeasurable counter-instrument—is specific and non-obvious. Ritual polishing of cracked marbles feels fresh; trope of wise gardener is re-animated through bodily fusion with plants. Risk of sentimentality is high, yet story avoids it by letting the maze stay indifferent—its final pulse could be read as either answer or random twitch. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
