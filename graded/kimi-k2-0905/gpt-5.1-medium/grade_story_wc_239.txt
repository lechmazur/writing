<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>No-One’s solitary vocation is vividly particularized; the way he counts “categories instead of heartbeats” shows a mind fused to its task. His final act—laying the dictionary into the blank center—externalizes an inner hierarchy of values under pressure. Because the story hinges on a single consciousness, relational crucible and status dynamics don’t apply, but interior contradiction is subtly active: he both clings to memory and relinquishes singular history. The cost is felt in the hush that “pealed outward,” a sonic image of his own erasure; this earns the renunciation without tidy emotional arithmetic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the braided single history is not claimed but quietly shown when the hush “pealed outward,” reweighting the premise that remembrance must be exclusive. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative) rather than strictly causal; the spiral walk accumulates density until the dictionary’s placement knots all strands. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation—temple corridors that “fold back on themselves”—and this pays off when the same geometry becomes the arbitration ritual, so no penalty applies. Cost is legible in the instant No-One loses plural pasts: the universe exhales one breath, he stands inside it, and the reader feels the narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library is not backdrop but prosthetic mind: shelves that dissolve from astrology into grammar enact the encyclopedic drift of memory itself. Spatial choreography stays coherent—nested rings of books converge on a blank exactly dictionary-sized—so the setting literally constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (the cracked obsidian lectern, the candles that flare sideways) doubles as sensory register of the cosmic hiccup, anchoring scale in body. Because the environment supplies the only possible stage for the ritual, the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—whether remembrance can survive the next universal reset—is signaled in the opening line and tightened by each shelf-pass that prunes possible histories. Agency is continuous: every step is an act of attention that refuses to flinch when galaxies blink out. The visible price is the annihilation of alternate pasts, felt as a draft across skin; this single deepening satisfies the 8-band threshold. No reversal is needed; the spiral’s final circuit is the meaningful narrowing that forecloses all but one braid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image-pattern of circles: the hush “peals,” the corridors spiral, the dictionary lies in a blank ring—each return reweights remembrance from burden to gift to sacrifice. No moral is declared; the final image of unified history is a non-literal answer to the question “Who remembers?” Subtext operates in negatives: what is lost is heard as silence, not voiced. The refusal to state a thesis lets the concept resonate as felt pressure rather than idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s perceptual signature is relentless synesthetic abstraction: a hush can “peal,” candles flare “shyly,” definitions curl “like shy animals.” This diction stays inside a mind that has read reality as lexicon for eons. Rhythm lengthens and contracts to mimic the spiral walk—long sentences coil, then snap to short declaratives at the knotting. Compression like “universe holding its breath” teaches the lyric pattern early and is paid off when the same breath is exhaled in the final hush; no head-hop or register drift occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentence variety is high; openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and noun phrases to avoid template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but coherent—every metaphor is a variation on breath, circles, or dust—so the overwriting check is passed. The one paraphrase-loop risk (“wanderingly exact” repeated) is justified as ritual incantation, not artifact. Information density is strong: a single line (“physics into grammar”) compresses epistemic collapse without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic reset myth with lexicographic ritual is non-obvious and internally inevitable; the story could not swap “library” for any generic archive without breaking its logic. The spiral arbitration law is freshly coined yet feels discovered, not invented. Risk in second-person address to the reader is avoided; the piece stakes everything on lyric abstraction and survives. The final reconfiguration satisfies the transformation test: renaming No-One or the temple would flatten the resonance.</comment>
