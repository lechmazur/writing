<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Isera’s refusal to wait and her insistence on climbing now crystallize a hierarchy of values—crown versus cosmos—yet the interior contradiction between queenly duty and star-called identity is asserted more than dramatized in body-level choice. The final step into the grotto is a genuine micro-choice, but the cost (abandoning harvest treaties) is off-stage, muting felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dream → seventh warning → iron taste → climb → grotto revelation; each beat narrows options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—starlight wounds reframe her reign—visible cost is the forsaken treaty and the sky’s bleeding future now tethered to her skin. Orientation is clean by line 4; lens stays Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain path, goat-hut, storm-bruise, and cobalt grotto are filtered through Isera’s urgency; every sensory note (metal-and-fruit air, shattered-glass ceiling) constrains forward motion. The grotto’s pulsing stone literally guides her final step, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent sky-death by confronting dream-source—tightens once: storm threat vs. immediate climb. The climb itself is the irreversible trade-off; treaty loss is the visible price. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no reversal, but option foreclosure is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sovereign identity versus cosmic summons emerges through starlight wounds and crown-on-floor imagery; no moralizing. Final reconfiguration—she remembers a truer name—invites reflection on rulership as mere ornament. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Isera’s perceptual bias—sky as listening ear, silks hissing like snakes—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens then fractures under storm pressure; diction remains monarchic yet star-drunk. No dialogue artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm carries ascent breathlessness; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—sky as wound, crown as ornament—without purple overload. High information density: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and foreshadowing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bleeding starlight as sovereign identity crisis feels fresh; ember grotto above clouds reverses underworld trope. Dream-propelled abdication twists expected fantasy quest. Specificity of “lace soaked in venom” voice keeps it from generic epic pastiche.</comment>
