<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s shift from passive resistance to active “whisper” is embodied in the vial-handling beats; the moment she presses her palm to the lens is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—anger at the sea’s exhaustion versus tenderness toward it—kept live in the body (throat ache, dropped shoulders). The cost is visible: Jorah’s silence and her hammering heart. Only the grandmother memory flirt with summary, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-density and light-pattern accumulate until the beam reconfigures from “harsh white spear” to “softer cobalt wash.” The single tightening is the scent-triggered lens-glow, which reweights the stake and lands with conceptual cost—the sea’s forgiveness is now socially legible to the boats. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options foreclose for Jorah’s noise philosophy while Mara's tactic is ratified. No orientation debt; causality clean.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tower, cooling basalt, wet rope, and the lens-as-tool all constrain tactics: only scent can pass through the quartz, not sound. The lighthouse itself becomes both environment and instrument; its stone “stopped radiating anger” mirrors internal de-escalation. Micro-setting (chipped cork, cloudy vial) reappears at closure, charging the final image. Sensory economy is flawless—every detail either filters POV bias or enables the scent transmission.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled early and tightens when the beam softens, forcing Jorah’s tacit capitulation. Escalation is density-driven: scent-layer replaces horn-layer, narrowing options for audible navigation. Cost is felt: Mara’s throat ache, Jorah’s dropped shoulders, the boats’ hush. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no reversal inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: noise colonialism vs. consensual invitation. Subtext lives in Jorah’s “voice scouring the dawn” versus Mara’s “screaming tenderness.” Final image—boats answering a silent beam—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; particulars (cork color, lens quartz) carry the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: lighthouse as “breathing softly,” scent as “forgiven arguments.” Syntax lengthens with scent diffusion, shortens with horn blasts—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; Jorah’s interior is read only through gesture. Vocabulary stays within coastal lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“mist slipped…like breath easing from a feverish chest”—and pay off in the cooled-stone payoff. Information density high: “the old cork sighing as if relieved from duty” does three jobs (sound, personification, backstory). No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: perfumancy-as-navigation weaponized in a lighthouse. Trope of keeper-vs-sea is flipped—sea becomes sentient partner, not adversary. Risk taken: scent-as-beam is non-realist yet cued by quartz permeability, paid off by boats’ wordless turn-in. If swapped to generic magic, story collapses; hence irreplaceable.</comment>
