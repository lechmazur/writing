<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The assistant keeper’s trembling hands and whispered summons embody a credible shift from passive listening to active, embodied risk; the final forehead-to-forehead silence with Jonas shows a relationship re-forged under pressure. Interior contradiction is vivid—“a need so fierce it could only speak softly”—and the choice to relinquish volume costs the protagonist his habitual invisibility. The only hairline slip: the phrase “screaming tenderness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the climactic beat, slightly blunting embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tower’s tremor transmits the purified whisper, Jonas arrives ashamed, and the shared tending of the beam crystallizes a new linguistic contract with felt cost—silence replaces foghorn dominance. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the cork’s filtration and scent-ritual tighten options until the final image reweights the rule-set. Orientation is swift—cobalt lighthouse at dawn within 30 words—and every beat advances because/therefore linkages or density accumulation without lapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt tower functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its lantern room must be tuned, the railing becomes the transmission point, and the jasmine-scented cork charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt-polished wood, exhausted slap of sea—mirroring the protagonist’s narrowed auditory focus. Spatial choreography is immaculate: stair landing → lantern → railing → shadow at dawn; no floating bodies or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—tightens once through ritual escalation: each cork-whisper and scent-loading raises the wager until the off-beat blink confirms the tactic. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: Jonas’s shame and the forfeiture of foghorn certainty. A hairline gap: the stakes could sharpen even earlier if the narrative showed Jonas explicitly threatening to leave over the volume dispute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication as vibration rather than amplitude. Subtext resides in gesture—pressing finger to Jonas’s lips, the warmed cork—never in thesis statements. The final image of two silhouettes tending a “promise sent gently” reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing: the coast’s language rule-set is permanently altered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: auditory metaphors for touch—“my teeth sing”—and salt-soaked diction (“rinsed clean, like a blue bone”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses during scent-ritual, clipped fragments at the blink. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly under stress. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual—Jonas’s ashamed silence speaks louder than confessions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, ritual step, or sensory cue without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “blue bone,” “exhausted anger,” never stacked in a single beat. One near-loop: “whisper can travel farther than a shout” is conceptually reprised, but the final phrasing shifts to “promise sent gently,” avoiding verbatim churn. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the tower’s mechanical tremor stays physically coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-as-bell and cork-as-filter synthesize fresh physics of intimacy, transforming the familiar “quiet truth” trope into tactile engineering. Risk is high—magic scented telegraphy could have read as twee—but specificity of jasmine crushed on stone and the off-rhythm blink ground the conceit. The inversion of coastal acoustics feels inevitable in hindsight: volume defeated by resonance. No derivative template or famous-scene echo detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: assistant keeper introduced in line 1. Development: carries kerosene, accepts cork, performs ritual. Closure: co-tends the beam, proving whisper efficacy. Cost: surrenders anonymity and confronts lover’s shame. Irreplaceable—only the assistant’s subordinate status grants access to both cork and tower mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Cork appears in first third, warms under breath in two distinct beats, transmits final whisper, and is smelled by Jonas at closure. Its polished wood and retained jasmine charge the last image. Removing it collapses the entire filtration logic and the haptic proof offered to Jonas.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Vibrations of intent” is signaled early, operationalized through tower tuning and cork warming, and validated by the off-beat blink. It reweights the coastal language rule-set at closure. Without it, the central wager dissolves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Purification trait refuses the protagonist’s first loud laugh, forces whispered sincerity, and enables the successful transmission. The cost is the exposure of raw need. Removing the purification breaks causality—shout would clog the channel.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Beckon” is the pivotal action: whisper into cork, release via scent and tremor. It directly triggers Jonas’s arrival and replaces foghorn summons. Any synonym would lose the gentle invitation that defines the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Garden scent is introduced mid-story, mechanics taught (crush leaves, carry upstairs, swirl through cork), and its absence would void the transmission medium. It also softens the tower’s mechanical aura, enabling tenderness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors the first paragraph, supplies the tunable bell apparatus, and frames the final cobalt shadow where foreheads meet. Its color and mechanism are indispensable to both atmosphere and plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Post-heat-wave timing allows cooler air to carry sound and motivates the urgency to replace foghorn volume. While referenced, it could be swapped to “after the storm” with minor edits, hence not absolute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Motivation is declared early—“I needed proof for the man I loved”—and every ritual step serves that proof. The final shared tending validates the whisper thesis, closing the loop at visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Screaming tenderness” is seeded in the lantern room, modulates through quiet ritual, and culminates in the silent forehead touch. The oxymoron charges the closure image; removing it unthreads the tonal spine.</comment>
