<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Noah’s quiet vigilance is embodied in micro-choices—cutting the engine to listen, reading the letter aloud, stacking stones until his fingers bleed—each action revealing a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The interior contradiction between his reticence and sudden need to “protect her quiet courage” is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Final endurance—writing the unsigned note, accepting anonymity—carries visible cost and is earned by the causal chain. Missing 9 only because the off-stage boyhood storm-closet beat is told once and not re-anchored to a present-tense stimulus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp’s sighing return reconfigures the stakes—anonymous guardianship replaces overt heroism—and the cost (bleeding fingers, lifelong anonymity) is legible in the final image. Causal lens holds throughout: because the lamp fails, therefore Noah listens, therefore he inherits the letter chain, therefore he writes and rebuilds the beacon’s moral filament. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (skiff, Brinecap Light, October dusk). No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the sea glass and cairn system track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool converge: the black lens “stares,” the shingle beach constrains stone choice, the weak skiff lamp forces the cairn code into tactical play. Selective sensory hierarchy—salt grit in blood, iced fuel lines—mirrors internal pressure without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the headland and lantern spiral. Final image of the single tall cairn charges the closure under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmarked guardianship of unseen mariners—is signaled early and tightens when the radio mast fails; stone code becomes the only remaining agency. One meaningful deepening: Noah shifts from passive observer to active link in the anonymous chain, foreclosing personal recognition. Cost is visible—blood, anonymity, lifelong silence—under the causal lens. Coincidence (trawler horn response) complicates but does not resolve, keeping escalation coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the stone-and-paper relay: safety is not a blaze of glory but an unsigned promise passed hand to hand. Subtext lives in gesture—Maris watching Noah’s mouth “as if the words were a lantern”—without thematic echo sentences. Final image reweights the premise: the beam’s silver sigh is not victory but shared, invisible labor. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unnamed next keeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Noah’s perceptual signature—weights of crates, moods of waves, the lens “black as a closed eye.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“He wrote, in careful block letters…”) yet retains maritime cadence. No head-hopping; Maris’s interior is accessed only through her observable tremble and gaze. Distinct voice modulation between quiet vigilance and the final, almost whispered capitulation to anonymity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—lighthouse as throat, lens as eye—without mixed metaphors. High information density: “three flat stones meant safe water, two meant trouble, and a single tall cairn meant come” teaches rule and stakes in one breath. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for fog, staccato for filament repair—propelling to the final silver sigh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The anonymous letter-and-sea-glass relay flips the familiar “lighthouse keeper” trope into a meditation on invisible solidarity. Stone-code world-building feels discovered, not invented; risk of anonymity as heroism is fully committed to. Specificity of October frost, brass table, green softened glass anchors universality. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight: the beam’s return is less victory than communal vow—fresh, non-obvious, emotionally specific.</comment>
