<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s contradictory impulses—clinging to survival-guilt while courting self-annihilation—are dramatized in the bead-transfer beat. The renunciation costs his literal pulse, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“mournful elation”) flirt with label-speak. Still, the final endurance reads as earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms, the ghost sleeps, Eli’s heart is emptied—cost is the final image. Causal chain (bead-resonance→orchard awakening→life-for-life) holds from inciting visit to last glow. Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse-as-lung, moon-distilling apparatus, and bead-as-pendulum constrain every tactic; the glass walls literally trap the resonant field that powers climax. Sensory detail is selective—ash-veil, frost fingerprints—filtered through Eli’s alchemical lens. Spatial choreography stays clean across two ghost entries and the resonator build. The final glowing pear recharges the setting-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem the valley or let it freeze—tightens when each ghost visit costs the bride a century of rest, forcing Eli to act. The resonator build is the visible escalation; it forecloses retreat. Agency is high: he chooses to sing his heartbeat into the stone. Cost is legible, though the “orchard wakes” beat feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of debt-as-resonance emerges through action: the bead’s return reweights every prior bottle of moon-medicine as palliative without soul. No moralizing—final image of Eli eating dawn-lit pear lets reader feel the price of survival. Ambiguity lingers: valley lives, narrator hollowed, ghost freed. Subtext in ghost’s “lovingly venomous” tone carries both forgiveness and vengeance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distilled, archaic cadence that matches the alchemical orchard and never slips into modern filler. Perceptual signature is consistent: Eli notices temperature, resonance, sap, never tourist-catalog. Compression (“I ate it in tears”) teaches the reader to accept ellipses. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal monologue stays concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: sentences vary from short frost-bites to longer resonant clauses. Figurative layering (“roots ran like lightning”) stays coherent within the story’s physics. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-stack. One mixed metaphor—“warm lung”—but it is taught early and functional, so forgiven. Final line lands with image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-war eco-gothic with Chinese ghost-debt resonance feels fresh; the alchemical orchard lit only by bottled moonlight is a specific, memorable frame. The bead-as-heart reversal transforms a trinket into organ, an image unlikely to survive relocation. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the eaten pear. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule patches.</comment>
