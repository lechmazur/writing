<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait drive every micro-choice; the brush gift and Ro’s arrival are credibly motivated by prior kindnesses. Interiority stays concrete (“chest hurt,” “shoulders rose”) and contradictory impulses (hope vs. survival) coexist in-scene. The final “rouse” is earned because the alphabet experiment visibly costs her sleep and safety. Only the grandmother-memory transfer feels slightly too convenient, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rooftop reconfigures the city’s emotional economy and the cost—Mira finally sleeps—is felt on the last line. Causal chain (moonbeam → script → Ro → collective alphabet) holds without gaps; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by line 40. The single tightening beat—Ro’s recognition—forecloses his cynicism and opens the communal path. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, citrus scent, and soot-filtered moonlight constrain every action; the brush’s crescent tip literally shapes the letters and the final image. Smog’s tactile thickness (“drowned streetlamps”) mirrors Ro’s constricted lungs, charging the moment he breathes easier. Spatial choreography stays clean as bodies move between easel, panes, and tea thermos. Environment is indispensable to tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove kindness persists—tightens when Ro’s almost-recognition pain converts private ritual into public risk. One meaningful escalation: the decision to paint the entire roof alphabet, narrowing Mira’s anonymity to exposure. Cost is visible—she forfeits secrecy and the last of her stamina. Under causal lens, because/therefore links hold without coincidence resolving anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated image: language lost to industrial dust is re-inhaled as communal breath. Subtext lives in gesture—Ro’s loose mask, the offered thermos—never thesis. Final word “rouse” reweights the rooftop from refuge to beacon without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the city may still devour them, but the alphabet now exists—earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: moonlight “opens a door inside her,” saffron crocuses color her mood. Syntax lengthens under daydream, shortens at Ro’s knock, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Ro’s interior is accessed only through external cues and dialogue. Distinct rhythmic control supports pressure without obscurity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “letters… drifted up like seeds” does double sensory work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within smog/light/seed lexicon. One near-purple line (“methodically hopeful that one clean beam could still reach”) is justified by voice and not repeated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of insomnia, lost language, and moonlit graffiti feels inevitable yet unexampled; the rooftop greenhouse as archive is a fresh spatial logic. Risk—using calligraphic strokes as memory seeds—pays off by forcing collective recognition. Transformation test fails if moved to another city or medium. Specificity of saffron tea, jam jar, and moon-tipped brush anchors universals in irreplaceable objects.</comment>
