<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory calm vs. panic, the embodied “borrowed heartbeat,” and the final micro-choice to release it all track cleanly; the painter remains archetypal, but the POV’s interiority is specific and the renunciation costs on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lullaby-code → find painter → mirror test → surrender pulse → save both kids. The mirror corridor collapses into one decisive future and the bells provide audible cost at the exact beat the pulse is let go—clean Earned Stasis with price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain-slick prism parapet is returned three times, each time re-weighted: first as glittering bait, then as the mirror’s frame, finally as “ordinary stone” once grace is spent. Terrace acoustics and canal hush ground spatial orientation without cataloguing the city.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sister’s noon death—tightens through visible clock (bells) and the pulse-loan expiry. One meaningful deepening: mirror reveals survival costs a stranger’s life; protagonist’s surrender narrows options to a single irrevocable act with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “possibilities must be chosen, not kept” emerges through the mirror test and pulse release; no moralizing statement, only the image of ordinary stone after rainlight. Final line reweights the entire quest without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a consistent lyric compression; perceptual signature filters world through chromatic, musical, and haptic detail. No head-hopping; painter’s dialogue is spare, ritualistic, differentiated from narrator’s denser interior cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is dense but patterned—rain, prisms, pulses—teaching the reader early. One mixed metaphor (“calm as a pond that knows stones will sink”) barely grazes clarity; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantastical premise (loanable heartbeats, mirrors of possibility) is grounded in a concrete ethical trade-off; lullaby-code mechanic feels fresh and necessary. Risk in lyric compression pays off; story would collapse if any core image were swapped.</comment>
