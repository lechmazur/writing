<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s buried gift for naming is credibly withheld and painfully re-activated; the decision to seed the stone with the raw goodbye costs voice and safety, earning the closing path. Interiority stays concrete—“tasting metal,” “hands went numb”—avoiding label-speak. One hairline slip: the seer’s apology feels slightly performative, not quite sharp enough to pierce status.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain exhales, aisles fix, and the true shoreline replaces gentler lies—cost is the unedited memory now irretrievably externalised. Causal chain holds: because the narrator sacrifices silence, the stone rewrites the store’s nightly shuffle. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when corridors stabilise under named breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain’s wet aisles, mica-glittering spines, and breathing stacks constrain every move; the feather’s micro-texture becomes the compass that charges the final exit. Spatial choreography stays exact—downward descent, locked case, atlas door—so environment literally shapes tactics. One notch off perfection: the shoreline image arrives only in the stone, not yet walked, so constraint is conceptual rather than tactile at the very last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the true shape of home—tightens when the price is named: one unvarnished memory. The nightly-reality shuffle supplies escalating pressure; each named corridor pins the world, foreclosing the softer history the mountain offers. Cost is legible in the throat-blocking pain of the final seeding; no reversal beyond this is needed at 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of accurate naming: mercy that edits memory is refused, and the protagonist chooses the sharper truth. Subtext lives in gesture—the seer’s fingertip on the lock, the feather’s lightning—never in exposition. Final image of the crescent shoreline reweights all prior “gentler histories” without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a selective perceptual signature—storm-listening shelves, paper dust thunder—sustained through syntactic rhythm and controlled lexicon. Compression (“memory became painful”) is taught early and paid off in the unedited spill. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress, mirroring the tightening corridors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, accelerating during the corridor walk; figurative language is dense but patterned—storm, scales, thunder—so it teaches its own weather system. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“quill prickled with cold as if holding back lightning”—slightly over-pressurises the feather, nudging off perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory-donating mountain-bookstore that re-sorts reality nightly is a fresh synthesis; the feather-as-reader interface weaponises tactile literacy. Risk—trading edited mercy for raw recall—grows organically from the premise rather than grafted twist. Specificity of “soundless grammar” and “curve of shoreline” prevents template drift.</comment>
