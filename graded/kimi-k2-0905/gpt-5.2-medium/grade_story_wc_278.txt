<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio’s guilt is embodied (needle-buzz = submerged cry) and drives every move; the apology at the end is earned because the amber-tether choice literally rewires his skin and conscience. Interior contradiction is present—he both seeks and dreads hearing the cry—yet the sister remains off-stage, so the relational crucible is with himself, not another character. Still, the micro-choice to ink the comet-tail and clip the wire makes the cost visible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: guilt → letters → amber → lab → tether → translated cry → apology → muted guilt. The fold-time rule is taught early via the insect “suspended as if time had folded,” so the final retrieval feels inevitable, not contrived. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cry softens into meteor hush and the tether slackens—cost is the cooled amber and the new constellation scar. One minor slip: the wardrobe’s false drawer appears once and never constrains later action, a teleporting prop, but it does not break the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>City nights, decommissioned observatory, and the amber’s insect micro-setting are filtered through Lio’s tattooist gaze—star-chart skin, needle buzz, ink as blood. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (cry, hush, lullaby) over visual clutter, matching the lab’s acoustic cathedral. The amber’s temperature shift from “warm as skin” to “cooled” tracks emotional decompression and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: wardrobe → alley → hill → console → wrist, no impossible jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he silence the cry he once ignored?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he chooses to tether the translator to his own skin, risking fresh pain. Escalation is causal: each letter raises the cost of refusal, the amber flash forces action, and the translated sentence “I am cold” makes the abstract guilt visceral. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and acoustic. The price paid is the permanent comet-tail scar and the cooled amber, both on-page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges: neglected care becomes stored sound that can only be released by the caretaker’s own body. The meteor hush motif moves from ominous lid to earned quiet, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: clipping the wire to fresh ink = self-inflicted penance as circuitry. Final image reconfigures meaning—guilt is not erased but “muted enough to live with,” a Charged Poise that invites counter-readings of whether silence is healing or denial.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lio’s perceptual filter: sounds are star-mapped, skin is parchment, guilt is static. Syntax lengthens during the fold—long sentences mimic orbital drift—then fractures into short breaths as the cry translates. No head-hopping; Dr Sato’s dialogue is spare, clinical, contrasting with Lio’s lyrical interior without voice bleed. The lullaby-to-code shift is rendered through phonetic fragmentation, a texture only this POV would notice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “needle buzz sounded like a baby crying under water” fuses tool, sense, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops; “meteor hush” recurs with shifting valence, not repetition for padding. One mixed metaphor risk—“night water” opening overhead—skirts clarity edge but fits the observatory dome reveal. Rhythm accelerates into the final quiet, no scaffolding sentences drag the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Combines constellation tattooing, acoustic archaeology, and time-fold grief retrieval—synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The haunted firmware of unanswered infant needs reframes classic ghost-as-sound trope into ethical tech. Risky second-person address via letters is justified by antique-furniture conduit, avoiding exposition dump. Final image of cooled amber and fresh comet scar is specific to this story; swap elements and the emotional circuitry collapses.</comment>
