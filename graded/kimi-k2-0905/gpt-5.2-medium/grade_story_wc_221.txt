<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is textured and embodied—breath unspooling, temporal dissonance felt in bone—yet the “blessed pariah” label is asserted more than dramatized; no crewmate appears to challenge or confirm the status, so the social crucible is missing. The grandmother’s compass rose is handled twice with tactile precision, and the final choice to trust the sky’s needle over station arrows is credibly earned. Still, the internal contradiction between curse and calibration remains slightly abstract; a single beat of self-reckoning under the twin skies would have pushed it into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the double sky rewrites “north,” the hatch opens, and the coast road becomes the only valid vector—cost is the abandoned station and the lifelong stigma now re-valued as instrument. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (echoed silence, twin star-drifts, temporal echo) tightens the calibration until the page itself becomes compass. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“station hung above the black ocean”) and anchors hold; no lens ambiguity. The wheel-turn is a decisive physical act that externalizes the reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight abstraction of “curse” keeps it just below the gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The treated glass that overlays two temporal skies is the micro-setting that literally refracts choice; every other detail—rusted wheel, moonlit water, graphite dust—is filtered through the narrator’s calibrated attention. Spatial choreography is immaculate: pane → corner glimpse → hatch → rock → coast road, each move tracked without drift. The station’s “recycled breath” versus the outside’s “clean” air externalizes the stakes in a single sensory contrast. Environment constrains the final image: the notebook on the rock signs the date, turning setting into ritual instrument, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find true north or remain lost in temporal stigma—is signaled early and sharpened by each sensory mismatch. The midpoint tightening occurs when the same star in both panes reveals measurable drift, converting passive curse into active instrument; this reweights tactics and forecloses reliance on station arrows. Cost is legible: the narrator accepts permanent exile by opening the hatch. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens—density of star-lines, breath-echo, rust-cough—without causal reversals, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “direction is earned, not assigned”—a conceptual repricing performed by the sky itself, never moralized. The grandmother’s fisherman idiom (“the world lies about direction”) is the only thematic statement, planted early and reweighted when the twin-sky needle overrules station signage. Subtext resides in the silence of absent crew and the unmarked anniversary, both charging the final solitary signature. The ending image—cold applique points in palm—offers resonant, non-literal answer without sermon, meeting the 9- quick test; a hair’s-breadth short of 9+ only because the social dimension of “blessed pariah” stays off-stage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: time is felt as stretch, breath as unspool, magnetism as bodily tug. Syntax lengthens then contracts with the temporal drag—“each breath unspooled behind me”—then shortens at the hatch: “bolts surrendered with a cough.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. The lyric elision (“ventilation fans slow… like animals settling”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final loosening of temporal stretch, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: information dual-loads (“window faced the experimental ring, and beyond it the constellations”) without clog. Metaphors are coherent—magnet/filings, lantern, needle—none contradict the physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“temporally stretched feeling loosened into ordinary time”) costs −0.2; otherwise zero scaffold. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of rusted bolts, mirroring the calibration release. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the 9-band open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of maritime compass lore with relativistic time-dilation is fresh, not grafted: the grandmother’s gilded applique becomes astrolabe for twin-sky navigation. Risk is taken—entire plot hinges on treated glass physics—yet the piece commits fully, teaching the rule early and following implications. The “blessed pariah” trope is inverted: curse becomes instrument, stigma becomes calibration. Specificity of “graphite stub” and “patient pencil dust” anchors the concept in tactile memory, resisting generic substitution.</comment>
