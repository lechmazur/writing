<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rina’s contradictory impulses—self-reproach versus the need to repair—are dramatized in the salt-on-burns moment, grounding her arc in embodied cost. The pillbox as confession/tool crystallizes her hierarchy of values without exposition. Her final placement of it on the beam is a micro-choice that forecloses retreat, earning the quiet change. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: betrayal → exile → return → repair → warning sent. Snow-code is taught early and pays off when Tomas reads it; the radio repair is the decisive change that reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at closure. Cost is legible in the stinging salt and the pillbox left behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded bluff, tide cave, and the pillbox-as-micro-setting constrain movement and tool use, directly shaping the repair tactics. Sensory detail is selective—silver hush, solder warmth—filtered through Rina’s tactical attention. Weather is not backdrop but signal cover. Spatial choreography remains clean across the three on-page characters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the broken chain be repaired—tightens when Elsi’s silence threatens the relay. The salt-burn moment is the visible price that enables the radio fix, narrowing options: endure pain or fail the villages. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; coincidence complicates patrol timing but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair-through-scar emerges from soldered metal and self-burned skin, not assertion. Final image—pillbox left as vow—reweights the object from shame to covenant, offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in Tomas’s limp and hooded lantern implies his own unrepaired damage, enriching ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Rina’s perceptual filter: windrose initials, solder smell, sting of salt. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during radio tuning, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; Tomas’s interior is implied only through gesture. Voice avoids spy-genre cliché, instead using tactile diction—“silver hush,” “sliver of solder”—that feels character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and grounded—“mist slipped across the marks like breath over a mirror”—never stacked. High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, tool detail, and emotional cue. No scaffolding or filter-verb clusters in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spy-returns-to-repair trope is refreshed by the pillbox-as-tool rather than weapon, and by snow-code as analog encryption in a monitored world. Synthesis of salt, solder, and scar feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than shoot-out pays off. Could edge higher with sharper Elsi specificity.</comment>
