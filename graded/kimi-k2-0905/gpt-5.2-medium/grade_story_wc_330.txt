<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s muteness and carpentry are shown through tactile choice—every shave of wood is a micro-decision—so the “quietly persistent” trait is embodied, not labeled. The halo fragment as motive force is slightly abstract; we never learn why silence “ruined his life,” so the emotional cost is inferred rather than felt. Still, the final sung note is a credible renunciation of muteness, earned by the repair act, giving visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the train “stirs” and the halo ring flashes above the horse, reweighting silence from void to material. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each bell-chime, shard-hum, and wood-shaving thickens the pattern until the sung note releases it. The wrong-turn warning sets up the oasis reveal without breaking logic; cost is the lifelong muteness Rowan finally risks. Lens holds from first inhale to final shimmer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body-as-setting is exquisite: the ribcage-like roof, the lantern beam become “a soft column,” the shard’s moon-cold curve against skin. Every object—bells, crates, brass pipes—constrains movement and finally enables the halo projection. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track Rowan’s kneel, drink, lift, and lead without drift. The micro-setting (wooden flank as map) directly charges the repair and the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Rowan wrest a voice from silence? Pressure escalates via sensory densification—each bell brightens, the hush thickens, the shard hums—until the act of repair forces the sung note. No external antagonist is needed; the misting hush is the opposing medium. The oasis wrong-turn tightens options: drink or retreat; drinking enables the release, so agency drives escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as silence = raw material: “silence was not an absence but a craft material.” No character spells this out; it crystallizes in the halo ring that maps wood grains. The bells’ comma-sentence metaphor reweights earlier chimes into syntax, giving conceptual repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the train really move, or is the stir aspirational? The resonance holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Rowan’s perceptual filter: wind bells are “sewn from bottle caps,” lantern light becomes “a soft column.” Syntax lengthens under pressure—“the misting hush loosened”—mirroring inhalation. No dialogue, so voice is carried by cadence and image; the final breath-sung note is a perfect non-verbal line. Register never drifts above the carpenter’s tactile lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “lace of wind bells,” “whispering gleam,” each image does double duty for atmosphere and stakes. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances either the repair or the hush-release. One mixed metaphor risk—“train seemed to inhale”—is saved by the sustained lung motif. Final line varies rhythm, letting the last comma-ring echo the bells.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The abandoned-circus-train trope is transmuted into a lung-like organ that breathes silence. A mute carpenter who sings a horse back to life is fresh, and the halo fragment’s moon-cartography feels invented on the spot. Risk: lyric accumulation could have collapsed into vagueness, yet specificity of wood-shavings and bottle-cap bells keeps it grounded. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
