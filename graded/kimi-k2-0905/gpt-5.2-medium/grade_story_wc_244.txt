<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “desperately jocular” mask is shown through embodied action—laughter that feels hungry, jokes as fire-keeping—yet the interior contradiction (need hidden behind logistics) is only asserted, not dramatized in a beat where it slips and costs her. The narrator’s loneliness is concrete in the opening image of the unclaimed city, but the decisive shift from client to companion is compressed into a single yes, so the cost feels scaled to word-count rather than character depth. Still, micro-choices (cigarette → coat → child) tether the rock’s warmth to visible reciprocity, earning the shared silence at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rock cools only after the narrator accepts company, reconfiguring the station into a “self-appointed timetable of mutual debts.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each small kindness raises the rock’s temperature until the pattern crystallizes—and the final image of the suitcase-note carries undeniable conceptual cost: the cure must be passed on. Causality holds; no late rule changes. The Orientation Test is waived: initial disorientation (who, when) is taught early and pays off when the platform becomes legible through reciprocal action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-swallowed station is not backdrop but resource: ivy curtains part to reveal the altar-suitcase, and the cracked clock’s shadow tracks the midnight deadline that ends the rock’s warming. Spatial choreography is clean—tickets migrate, bodies circle Mara, the suitcase remains anchored—so the micro-setting constrains the exchange sequence. Sensory selection favors tactile immediacy (ash-warm fragment, paper tickets scraping platform) over vista, charging the final image of shared silence under broken glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs. reciprocal connection—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each micro-exchange: every gift narrows the narrator’s isolation while raising the social debt recorded only in collective memory. One meaningful deepening: the realization that Mara is “first patient,” not courier, reframes prior jokes as masked need and forces the narrator’s final yes. Cost is visible on-page: the rock cools only after the narrator accepts company, foreclosing solitary retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accrual of tiny, ridiculous favors that become a non-statement moral economy; no character moralizes. The moon rock’s rule—“deliver kindness or it goes cold”—is learned through action, then reweighted when the narrator must relinquish ownership, turning theme from cure to relay. Final image of the suitcase-note offers resonant non-literal answer: loneliness ends not by possession but by passing the debt forward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a weary, lyric perceptual signature: silence is “alive but unclaimed,” jokes are “fire to keep the dark from sitting too close.” Syntax stretches under emotional load—“polite anarchy of the platform kept humming”—yet stays idiomatic. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is inferred only through her guarded grin and the narrator’s late recognition, maintaining distance control. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Mara’s tipped invisible hat and “Congratulations, you look terrible” snap with jocular hunger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high: one sentence often does two jobs—“I gave my last cigarette to the barber, the barber mended a torn coat for a thief, the thief returned a lost child” advances plot, tallies reciprocity, and keeps rhythm. No scaffold loops; metaphors (jokes as fire, timetable of debts) stay coherent. Register holds: no filter-verb stacks or thesaurus churn. Final line—“my silence felt shared”—earns its abstract noun because the prior chain of concrete gifts has embodied the transformation.</comment>

<comment>The moon-rock-as-social-credit premise feels fresh, yet its emotional engine is ancient: hospitality law encoded in object. Reciprocity rule is introduced early, tested through micro-exchanges, and paid off when relinquishing the rock becomes the price of companionship. Risk—mixing disaster logistics with folk-tale logic—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry because every beat obeys the warm/cold constraint. Final image of the note in the suitcase makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
