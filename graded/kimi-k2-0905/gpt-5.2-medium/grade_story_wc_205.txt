<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Len’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary nostalgia vs. curatorial humility—cohere in the velvet-over-mirror gesture and the final poem; the shard’s deliberate fracture reweights his failed past into open futures, paying the cost of certainty. Interiority stays embodied (“burnished sorrow softened into resolve”) and drives micro-choices. Yara’s grief is sketched more lightly but still forces a joint stance change. Only the sister-loss reference feels briefly abstract, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blurred communal map forces every faction to confront plural pasts, foreclosing single-narrative possession. Causal chain intact—shard → alcove vision → co-curated storm exhibition. Mosaic structure taught early (visible-time rule) and transitions legible. Cost is unmistakable: “the asteroid’s baroque stonework had shifted by a fraction.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visible-time strata, gilded buttresses, and mirrored nave are filtered through Len’s poet-eye; each prop (shard, velvet, storm) constrains tactics. Micro-setting (his pocket, gallery mirrors) stages pivotal choices. Spatial choreography clean across shards. Only the “iron craters” phrase repeats once without fresh work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls historical narrative—tightens when joint custodanship becomes the only way to prevent weaponization of the map. Escalation follows because/therefore logic: shard vision → shared risk → public blurred projection. Visible cost: both cede total victory. Minor slack: off-page “warring salons” stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—history as broken vase, more honest when fractured—emerges through image pattern, not statement. Final poem naming “every faction as a necessary fragment” reweights prior lily motif without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: no side is fully right. Avoids thematic echo; only the phrase “old mistake would repeat” flirts with abstraction yet is saved by context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Len’s perceptual syntax (“poet’s habit of naming shadows”) with rhythmic, elevated diction that matches baroque setting. Velvet ritual teaches mirror-rule early; no head-hopping. Yara’s dialogue carries scholarly reserve distinct from Len’s imagistic idiom. One clause (“chaos had already stolen too much”) nears editorial summary but fits her grief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; strong verbs (“scrape the asteroid’s ornamented hull like a bow on tarnished brass”) propel. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Mixed metaphors absent. One scaffold risk—“visible time” repeated three times in 40 words—barely touches closure. Information density high; each clause adds stakes or texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing palimpsest asteroid, tangible time-strata, and curatorial dispute feels novel yet inevitable; trope of “broken artifact reveals truth” is inverted—the break is the truth. Shared projection solution avoids both victory binaries. Specificity of lily-cut pattern and star-route map anchors freshness. Minor risk: baroque space-revolutionary combo is familiar, but execution transcends it.</comment>
