<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. the need to host others’ grief—are alive in every beat; her micro-choice to keep writing while doubting charges the ending. The final renunciation (leaving pages pinned for strangers) costs her the clean ending she secretly wants, earned by the prior nights of shared ink. Jory’s pressure on her hand and memory knot is specific, never generic sympathy. Only the brother-fever backstory is told late and abstractly, blunting interior contradiction a hair short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank square’s deliberate silence reweights all prior squares and whale-song into a public grief-archive; cost is the unfinishable symphony now living in Mara. Accumulative lens holds: each copied square thickens the tower’s air and the whales’ timing, pattern-break is the blank center. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (roofless tower, salt wind, Mara polishing brass). No causal break; tile’s rule is taught early and persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s brass rail, ink-blotched pages, and moon-path on water constrain every writing turn; the pinned sheets become the final image. Whale breaches are timed to row-sums, merging sea and sky into one instrument. Micro-setting (cold ceramic tile pressed to palm) alters breath and handwriting pressure, charging the climax. Salt rust and ink smell thread every beat, never backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared writing create a bearable chamber for grief—tightens when the square first shifts under Mara’s hand, then again when Leena’s chord enters the symphony. Each transcription forecloses the option of private closure; the blank center is the visible price. Pressure escalates under accumulative density: pages multiply, whales synchronize, air thickens. No reversal, but the deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: grief is a public score that can only be held, not solved. The unheard symphony motif migrates from metaphor to shared sensory fact without authorial comment. Final blank square reweights earlier math into silence—an unspoken answer that feels earned. No moralizing; the tower remains open, pages flapping like prayer flags of unfinished meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s skeptical ear; perceptual signature is salt, brass chill, ink rhythm. Sentence length mirrors whale cadence—long swells, short breaches. No head-hops; Jory’s and Leena’s interiors arrive only as chord blooms in Mara. Compression (“memory knot,” “unheard symphony”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from polysyllabic swells to monosyllabic breaching beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds ink, salt, or sound. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“lantern while insisting the dark was real” condenses Mara’s stance. Only minor filter verb (“she realized”) in climax line, not enough to dull propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Magic-square-as-memory-sculptor is fresh; whales as time-keeping percussion is an unexpected synthesis. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have drifted into gimmick, but whale-route/constellation linkage grounds it. Tile inherited from drowned navigator feels inevitable, not convenient. Specificity of tarred-rope chord keeps the concept from floating into abstraction.</comment>
