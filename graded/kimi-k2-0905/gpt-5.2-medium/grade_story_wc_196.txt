<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-rooted need to “magnify small kindnesses” is embodied in every micro-choice—reading blotches, cutting twine, drafting the letter—so the final shared silence with Josie feels earned. Interiority stays concrete; the button’s warmth and sour smell anchor emotion in body, not label. The only minor slip is the single-sentence articulation of motive in paragraph 1, which edges toward thesis-statement, but the next beat immediately re-embodies it, so cost remains visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the button left on the table reweights both women’s futures with undeniable, unpaid cost. Causal chain is clean—dust rectangle → Drawer 4 → bundle → letter → Josie’s tremor—each because/therefore step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“foster care file room”) and holds. One persistent constraint shapes tactics: the missing page that refuses erasure; this price is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The file room’s sweat-and-song seasonality, the brass button’s lightning-crack, and the “sour smell of smoke and river mud” are selective, POV-filtered, and directly guide Mara’s next move. Micro-setting (button in palm) constrains the emotional climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: cabinet → table → Drawer 4 → twine cut, no impossible moves. Only the river-mud scent arrives late; still, it pays off instantly in the same beat, so no momentum loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trace unknown histories to keep the next heart from breaking”—is signaled early and tightens when the dust rectangle forecloses the option of believing the file complete. The midpoint reversal (finding Eli’s letter) escalates pressure under causal lens: Mara must decide how much truth to offer Josie. Cost is visible: Mara’s reopened grief, Josie’s tremor, and the button left exposed. No coincidence resolves; the missing page complicates, not solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—mercy archived against erasure—emerges through the button’s journey from Civil War cellar to foster-care table, never stated as moral. Subtext lives in gesture: Josie asks “why a soldier would write such a thing,” Mara answers obliquely, silence carries the weight. The ending’s refusal to cry, only to tremble, invites lingering ambiguity about whether mercy can heal. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is visceral in the brass pebble.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays strictly with Mara’s perceptual signature—“paper lives,” “skin of gray,” “warm from her skin”—syntax lengthens under grief, then tightens at the reveal. No head-hopping; Josie’s tremor is observed, not interiorized. Diction remains within a county clerk’s lexicon; no corporate register intrudes. Rhythm modulates: cumulative clauses mimic archival sifting, then short sentences snap the twine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty—description advances plot, no scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“small kindnesses” echoed in narration and dialogue) is minor enough to leave closure untouched. Metaphors are precise: button crack as “lightning vein,” grief shifting “from weight into lens.” No mixed vehicles or purple stacks. Copy is clean; pronoun reference unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The foster-care archive as Civil War mercy’s continuing battlefield is fresh; the button’s repurposing transforms standard heritage tropes. Specificity—dust rectangle map, replaced drawer label—creates inevitability in hindsight. Risk is taken in quiet, bureaucratic stakes rather than battlefield spectacle, and it pays off emotionally. No close echoes of famous scenes; the premise could not swap names without collapse.</comment>
