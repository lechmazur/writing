<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (counting breaths, ribs “crowded”), her motive to “stand by the unremembered” is repeatedly activated in micro-choices, and the final act of restoring Ken’s log carries visible emotional cost. The interior contradiction between terror and loyalty drives every beat; no stock labels intrude. She earns the ending’s quiet triumph through prior causality, not convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tidal window → notch appears → coil phase transition → cable repair → log released. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the phase-transition rule is taught early and pays off at climax. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Ken’s voice re-enters the world, Mara’s solitude is sealed. No teleporting props or causal amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sea cave’s throat-like narrowing, rusted consoles “leaning like tired animals,” and the reactor coil’s thrumming hush are selective, POV-filtered, and directly constrain movement and tactics. The gold fleck acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: water level, shoulder-width gap, terminal location all track. Environment mirrors internal loosening/tightening without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the unremembered brother’s voice—tightens as tide clock shrinks options. One meaningful escalation: phase-transition gamble forecloses retreat; failure = entombment + coast-wide silence. Cost is legible in trembling body and irreversible solitude after log release. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through cable signal, gold map, and returned voicemail—no abstract sermon. Final image of “ordinary surf” reweights earlier “crashing hush”: the world regains voice, Mara loses hers. Ambiguity lingers—was the pattern alive?—inviting reflection without tidy moral. Particulars (salt-crusted labels, gold fleck) carry thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-poetic (“phase mouth,” “cable heart”). Syntax shortens under stress (“Terror crowded her ribs”). No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. Compression like “crashing hush” is taught early and modulates to “ordinary surf” at closure, earning tonal shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“throat of stone,” “tired animals”). High information density: one line often does setting + emotion + stakes. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line breathes with rhythmic resolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spelunking horror with undersea-cable ghost is fresh; phase-transition mechanic feels inevitable yet surprising. Gold-fleck sensor repurposes medieval illumination for digital haunting. Risky lyric compression (“white fog that made the passage feel less solid”) pays off. Could swap coast for another, but core emotional tech is specific.</comment>
