<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—hope against distrust—drives every micro-choice; the decision to feed a false map is earned by her prior recognition of the sky-listening pattern and costs her the safety of neutrality. Embodied emotion is sharp (“hands steady despite the grit under her nails”). The final renunciation—handing over control to the town—carries visible cost: she forfeits sole authorship of the shield and accepts possible misuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (beacon shift → false map → hesitation → surrender) chains by because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the subsonic shield stays live, the town must now speak, and Mara’s forfeiture is felt. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no disorientation serves the ending. Cost is on-page: “she forfeits sole authorship” and accepts the town’s voice may betray her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Glass-and-rust dome, ink-splintered charts, and the transmitter’s guts are tactile and POV-filtered. The charts evolve from static props to active weapons, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: locked door, steps outside, east-west fault line. Micro-setting (pencil worn to a splinter) charges the climax image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls the signal—tightens when the beacon shifts with human quarrels, forcing Mara’s counter-map. One meaningful deepening: the false map causes the sky to “hesitate,” proving tricksters are opportunistic, not omnipotent. Price is legible: Mara loses unilateral control and must trust the town. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—weaponized wonder—emerges through the beacon that feeds on human division and Mara’s refusal to let either side own it. Subtext lives in the subsonic layer the town cannot hear but must now carry. Final image reweights prior material: the shield continues, but its authorship is diffused, costing certainty. No moralizing; resonance is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: astronomical precision braided with wartime shortwave nostalgia (“cosmic tricksters,” “baited meanings”). Syntax tightens under pressure—single clause bursts at the switch-throw. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices loops, ephemerides, and social fault lines. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to her headphones and grit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is sparse, surgical: “braided sound to starlight,” “prayer spoken through concrete.” Information density high—charts, tone generator, subsonic lattice packed into 740 words. Rhythm accelerates into the 2:13 a.m. switch without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cold-war shortwave paranoia meets SETI, turned into a social-engineering duel. The false-map gambit is non-obvious yet inevitable given the premise. Risk—subsonic sabotage that could accelerate conflict—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the charts and transmitter guts prevents generic SF gloss.</comment>
