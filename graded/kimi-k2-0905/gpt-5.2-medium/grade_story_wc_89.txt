<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-steadiness and willingness to pay an unnamed price are rendered through embodied spice-breath and the hound-press; the metamorphosis choice is earned. Yet the interior contradiction between clinging to human duty and surrendering to beasthood is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, keeping her short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spice-scented breath thickens the moonlit orchard until the corridor opens and Mira’s human shape is forfeited. Closure is a Charged Poise—two hounds circling under permanent moonlight—whose conceptual cost (she can never return) is legible in the final sap-scented line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard, moonlight, and spice function as micro-setting: the moonlit sap corridor literally gates the final choice. Sensory selection stays urgent—crushed star-anise smoke becomes the map—while spatial choreography remains clean from tree-bark to corridor mouth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge the bond or live with silence—is signaled early and tightens once: the bridge demands her human form. The price is visible the instant her bones loosen; escalation is single but sufficient under the lyric-accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as listening-as-transformation: the gift was never command but porous attention. The closing image of two hounds circling reweights earlier “beast whispering” into mutual translation, avoiding moral statement yet leaving resonant ambiguity about what she has gained or lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature—moonlight like milk, grief as tidal calm—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens then compresses in step with inhalations of spice, teaching the reader the patterned elision that pays off in the corridor step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from cavernous clauses to the final short circling line; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional elevated phrasing (“geometry,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts register above the POV’s concrete sensorium, a hairline slip that keeps it below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Phoenix-lit orchard and post-death hound-reunion risk fairy-tale familiarity, yet the spice-breath conjuration and equal-footing transformation feel specific to this voice. The synthesis of culinary scent-magic with grief-work yields a fresh inflection rather than ornament.</comment>
