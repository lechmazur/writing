<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel’s “calmly inventive” trait is embodied in every beat—rewiring locks, carving scratches, misdirecting Orven—so motive stays legible and intensifies. Interior contradiction is present but thin: we hear no simultaneous fear or guilt to complicate the triumph. Because the final renunciation (public neutrality) is earned by the causal chain of micro-choices, the arc satisfies, yet the absence of a counter-impulse keeps it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage is airtight: blackout → sentinel exploits blindness → sundial signal → locks ease → Orven fooled → revolution seeded. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I kept my face neutral and my revolution quietly alive” reconfigures stance with felt cost (permanent double identity). The persistent constraint—every lock still looks intact—shapes both tactic and aftermath. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; the lens holds start to finish.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through the POV’s professional eye: brass tumblers “nested like sleeping birds,” the sundial’s “ring of raw wood,” the fort’s skin “glowed alone like a wink.” Each detail doubles as tool and metaphor, guiding the hand that picks it. The blackout compresses perception to immediacies—sound of tumblers, slit of lantern light—so environment actively constrains choice. The final image of daylight returning on a neutrally-guarded fort recharges every prior glow and shadow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent liberation without detection—tightens once: when the shadow hits the third scratch, the protagonist’s option set narrows to irreversible complicity. Cost is legible: perpetual sentinel mask, empty Cradle, perpetual risk of discovery. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700 words; no safety resets. Coincidence (city-wide blackout) complicates rather than resolves, serving as curtain, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the quiet subversion of control architecture: locks, angles, light itself become instruments of emancipation. No moralizing line states this; the sundial’s unfinished arcs silently argue that incomplete systems invite rewriting. Final image reweights the fort’s glow from symbol of oversight to beacon of covert possibility. Ambiguity lingers: the sentinel is now both jailer and liberator, a duality the story never flattens into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a watchmaker’s precision: “I rotated the holder until its base aligned with three scratches…” Syntax ticks like tumblers. Diction stays within a tech-savvy guard’s lexicon; no sudden academic drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound of metal ribs, slit of shadow, private laugh—so every observation doubles as tool and mood. Under Orven’s battery lantern the voice stays calm, inventing misdirection in real time without head-hopping or register slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective: “locks that usually snapped at midnight eased open by a hair” does two jobs—sound and stakes—in one stroke. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; “winking hush” recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. A single filter-verb cluster is absent; prose stays tactile and immediate through the final click.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses clock-punk energy heist with architectural rebellion, rendered through a half-painted sundial as clandestine semaphore—fresh, specific, inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high: a blackout coup told in real time without violence, yet coherence never frays. The revolution’s anthem is literally a “satisfied click,” a sonic image that reconfigures genre expectations. If names and places were swapped, the entire mechanism would collapse—proof of non-generic integration.</comment>
