<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—"joy hurt like a pulled tooth" embodies the narrator’s paradoxical appetite for forbidden knowing. The contradiction between institutional obedience and private transgression is held in scene, not summary, and the final renunciation (teaching in spirals) costs her the safety of linear memory. Slight reserve: the emotional turn is foreshadowed so richly that the final weep feels pre-paid rather than freshly incurred.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the formula she steals reweights the city’s entire epistemic rule-set, and the cost is legible in the single line "I let the archive take the tears." Accumulative/textural lens holds—each irregular rotation thickens the light corridors until meaning, not plot, pivots. Pattern is taught early ("purification failed if done in a pattern") and pays off in the spiral curriculum, satisfying the taught-pattern clause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting: its waist-high facets constrain every tactical choice and refract the final image onto the city’s windows. Copper air and violet marble are sensuously specific yet filtered through the historian’s professional eye for archival decay. Only the orchard memory slips toward generic nostalgia, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she weaponize or defuse nostalgia?—tightens when the council scene reveals the trap she is about to spring on her own people. Each irregular rotation is a micro-choice that forecloses the safety of pattern, visible price paid in disorientation ("angles of light that changed steadily yet unpredictably"). The final spiral curriculum is earned renunciation, not convenient escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that knowledge without nostalgia is sterile, yet nostalgia weaponized is self-cannibalizing. The spiral curriculum reprises the pagoda’s irregular rotations, letting the image reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Final image of "nostalgia’s bright cages" crystallizes the thematic cost without abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains a scholar’s precision braided with sensuous hunger—"atoms of nostalgia that cling to ink, bone, and breath" could only belong to this narrator. Syntax lengthens under wonder, then fractures during purification, mirroring the risk of pattern relapse. No head-hopping; the elders’ dialogue is reported, not rendered, keeping focalization pure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers archival procedure onto emotional stakes. Figurative control holds—mixed metaphors are avoided even at peak beats. Minor scaffold: "turning the pagoda a quarter, then a seventh, then not at all" is a deliberate pattern-break rather than template cadence, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The notion that a civilization erased itself by binding nostalgia to its records is a fresh synthesis of memory-as-virus trope. The pagoda-as-purifier that must avoid pattern to succeed flips the usual "ritual requires perfect sequence" cliché. Risky second-person future glimpse ("I saw my younger self") is earned by prior causality and charges the final choice with inevitability.</comment>
