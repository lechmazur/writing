<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rook’s “jittery” trait is shown through kinetic motion—boots on scree, hands shaking—rather than label; the pendant refusal is an embodied micro-choice that costs him the safe completion of his last job, so the renunciation is earned. Interior contradiction is present (“wonder vs. routine”) but stays a touch abstract; still, the final chalk question externalizes the flaw and forecloses the courier path with visible social cost. Nera’s absence functions as a secondary pressure that sharpens his longing rather than a separate character, so relationship crucible is waived. Voice-specific perceptual tics (aurora “leaning closer”) keep the interiority idiosyncratic and non-generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Rook relinquishes ownership of the relic and writes the cairn question, a crystallized stance that reweights the entire delivery mission from transaction to seed-planting; the cost is the forfeiture of his Guild duty and the uncertain future this invites. Causality is accumulative-textural: each sympathetic vibration (lamplighter, mountain iron, children-to-come) layers density until the pattern breaks with the renunciation; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ridgeway… dawn”) and stays stable; the brief Nera vision is taught as mythic overlay rather than rupture. Lens holds from first beat to final image without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is not backdrop but active pressure: the cold scree forces Rook to keep moving, the sky’s green curtain mirrors the pendant’s wing-membrane, and the mountain’s buried iron answers the relic’s vibration—environment directly enables the climactic sympathetic stitch. Micro-setting (felt-wrapped pendant against chest) functions as portable locale that constrains handling choices. Sensory hierarchy favors motion and temperature over visual catalog, matching courier urgency. Spatial choreography is clean: switchback, saddle, cairn line up traceably; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“coax wonder from routine”—is signaled in paragraph two and tested when Mara’s certainty threatens to flatten the ridge tales into primer lists. The pendant’s refusal is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses the commercial path; cost is the lost commission and the open-ended accountability of the chalk question. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each vibration episode lengthens a moment but also increases Rook’s cognitive load of memory vs. myth, culminating in the cairn surrender. No coincidence resolves; the sympathetic mechanics are established early and remain consistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “wonder must be planted, not delivered,” refracted through the courier’s failed transaction and the schoolkeeper’s pedagogical fatigue; no character moralizes the thesis aloud. The dragonfly-wing motif migrates from commodity to collaborative listening device, re-weighted at closure when it stays inside the ridge rather than the purse. Ambiguity is purposeful: travelers will argue whether Rook was real, letting the myth seed propagate beyond the page. Final image (chalk question on stone) offers non-literal answer—attention itself is the relic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Rook’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax jitters—elliptical phrases, en-dash splices—mirror his adrenaline without breaking clarity. Diction (“frozen scree,” “stamped copper”) is courier-specific, not generic fantasy gloss. The lamplighter’s dialogue is spare, regional, and goal-driven (offering bread), distinguishing him from Mara's more measured educator cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from short pulse-like sentences under aurora glare to longer reflective stretches on Nera, supporting breath control. Figurative language is selective—only two sustained metaphors (aurora as curtain, thaw in stone) and both pay off in the sympathetic vibration logic. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances either motion, memory, or myth. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“no one could agree whether he was real”) releases into legend without expositional puff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The relic-courier trope is inverted: the job is to abandon the package, not complete the sale, turning logistics mythopoeic. Sympathetic vibration as a non-spell mechanic feels fresh and scientifically poetic, grounding magic in material resonance rather than wand-wave. The mentor’s absence is handled as negative space that actively shapes choices, avoiding expository flashback. Risk is taken with the open legend ending, yet it is earned by the prior pattern of lengthened moments and the chalk question that outlives the courier.</comment>
