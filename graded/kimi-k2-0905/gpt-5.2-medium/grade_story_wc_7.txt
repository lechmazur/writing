<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—gentle caretaker vs. clandestine insurgent—are dramatized in every pruning cut and tasting beat; the final choice to share rather than weaponize the fruit is earned by the remembered flavor of the botanist’s regret. Interiority stays concrete (“warm as a heartbeat”) and never drifts into label-speak. The cost is visible: she gives away the last fruit and shapes the tree into an open canopy, forfeiting future leverage. The only bar to 9.0 is that the neighbors remain off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is implied rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the communal bite rewrites neural pathways and reweights the Ministry’s rule-set, cost paid in Mira’s forfeiture of exclusive control. Causal chain (seed → pruning → alignment → shared meal) is tight; each beat alters tactical options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“rusted greenhouse at the edge of the collapsed rail yard”). No lens ambiguity; the final image of “debris into a small, luminous garden” crystallizes the new status under an Accumulative/Textural drive. Meets 9+ quick test with visible constraint shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s broken rafters and wet-iron smell constrain every action—glass skylights dictate planting site, bent ribs force pruning choreography, patrol lights outside meter the meal’s tempo. Micro-setting (cracked terracotta pot, nettle disinfectant) doubles as tool and symbol, charging the final open-canopy image. Sensory hierarchy is chef-driven: taste > smell > touch. Environment evolves causally—compost from burned books literally feeds the tree that rewrites minds. Meets 9+ gate: setting directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will Mira weaponize or share memory-fruit?”—is signaled by the botanist’s tasted regret and tightens through each pruning decision. One meaningful deepening: the realization that unpruned fruit would drown minds forces the penultimate careful cut, narrowing options to calibrated sharing. Cost is legible: she sacrifices sole power and risks Ministry reprisal. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural—each tasting session adds neural density until the alignment night crystallizes the communal stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: gentle rebellion via taste, not slogans. The final image of clerks planting seeds in tin cups reweights “beauty from ruins” without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence after meals and in the open canopy shape—an unspoken invitation. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis; the fruit’s shared warmth is the argument. Complexity lingers: beauty is safer, never safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays chef-filtered: perceptions arrive as flavors, synaptic tingles, compost recipes. Rhythm modulates—long horticultural sentences vs. clipped patrol-light beats. No head-hopping; POV distance holds. Diction (“kitchen scraps,” “nettle disinfectant”) stays within Mira’s lexicon. Voice peaks in the final pruning whisper, syntax mimicking lullaby. Minor hairline: one near-filter stack (“she understood the seed was meant…”) but immediacy recovers next line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (taste, memory, world-rule). Figurative language is sparse and precise: “moons lined up like coins on black velvet” serves as clock and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“branches tried to tangle… like a hand”) but it resolves into the canopy image without muddling closure. No artifacts in final third; eligible for 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + synaptic fruit + gentle insurgency synthesizes into a fresh parable that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric horticultural insurgency could have slid into twee, but pruned propaganda shoots and Ministry patrol lights keep stakes lethal. Transformation test fails if Mira becomes generic rebel—her palate and grandmother quotes make her singular. No close echoes of famous scenes. Bold structural choice to climax in a shared meal rather than shoot-out, and it pays off.</comment>
