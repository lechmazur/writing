<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The designer’s desire to “discover the texture of time” is concrete and embodied in every pruning cut and compass turn; the final renunciation—pressing the halo into the soil—pays the cost of that desire. Interiority stays specific (“gentle vertigo that shook my teeth”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is the woman’s expository monologue at the maze center, which momentarily flattens the contradictory impulses that had driven him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank photograph and rusting fragment reweight the entire premise—memory must be relinquished for the bridge to live. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (fading prints, syrupy air, dust) tightens the pattern until the maze consumes its own map. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off in the final image, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bridge-garden is not backdrop; its flexing tendrils and star-patterned leaves physically narrow corridors and force hyperbolic turns that shape the designer’s choices. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting: its ringed shadow opens the syrupy eye-path that traps and then releases him. One more tactile beat of the designer testing a hedge’s resistance would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I free the woman without destroying the bridge?”—is signaled early and tightens when the photographs begin to move, forcing the choice to let them disintegrate. The price is legible: Lio’s voice flips from old to young to absent, and the designer exits with only an empty image. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; a second intermediate complication would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of archival memory: clinging to images petrifies both past and present. The blank photograph at the end reconfigures that idea without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Lio’s silent mouthings, the woman’s grainy hand—never in exposition. One overt line (“time here was not a line but bark”) skirts thematic echo but is saved by its sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, compressed, and rhythmic (“the river below sounded like pages turning”). Hyperbolic geometry and retrocognition are handled with confident ellipsis that teaches the reader to trust the pattern. No dialogue means no voice-convergence risk. A single filter-verb cluster (“I felt… I understood… I heard”) slightly dulls the peak beat inside the maze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “syrupy air” and “bark of time” extend the vegetal logic. One paraphrase loop (“the maze was smaller, simpler, more humane”) could have been cut. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so 9+ remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The living bridge that metabolizes memory into architecture is a fresh synthesis of eco-SF and ghost-maze tropes. Hyperbolic geometry as emotional topology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting the central woman dissolve into exposition—almost capsizes the arc, but the blank-photo final image reclaims the gamble. The piece could not swap settings or tools without collapsing.</comment>
