<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Safi’s interior contradiction—needing to taste yet fearing touch—drives every beat; the final act of unwrapping his hands crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Micro-choices (spitting fear into sand, kneeling to accept contagion) embody his hierarchy of values. The soldiers’ borrowed grief lands because Safi’s body has already paid the price. One hairline slip: “quiet failures” is abstract summary amid otherwise embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Safi returns carrying the pavilion’s remorse, and the first soldier’s weep reconfigures the fortress’s emotional economy under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because he ingests the stored shame, therefore the squad’s dreams blunt. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image—“thin broth with dates and salt”—a persistent constraint that will flavor every future meal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert-rain reeks of brine and apologies, a sensory filter that guides Safi to the sinkhole; the coral pavilion’s frost-covered ribs constrain his bare-hand choice. Micro-setting—the linen wrappings—functions as tactile extension of character fear. Weather and drainage patterns directly enable discovery; no static postcard shots. One minor drift: “banquet hall for ghosts” edges toward generic, but the ice floor under shifting sand immediately re-grounds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Safi transmute collective remorse without being destroyed—tightens when he removes the linen: one irrevocable escalation under Accumulative lens. Pressure grows via density of tasted memories rather than external reversals; the final shared weep proves the tactic worked. No coincidence; the pavilion’s thaw is storm-revealed, not luck-served. Visible price: Safi’s body becomes living filter, a cost that will recur nightly in every ladle of broth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through palate-as-conscience: remorse is spice to be blended, not excised. Subtext lives in gesture—holding the weeping soldier instead of recoiling—showing grief can be communal sustenance rather than contagion. Final image of salted-date broth reweights the premise: mercy is a recipe that demands the chef keep tasting. No moralizing statement; the reconfiguration is sensory, not didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Safi’s synesthetic perception—“tasting the way other people listened”—a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens when he absorbs memories, then fractures into clause-spikes as shame scrapes him raw. No head-hopping; even the soldier’s weep is filtered through Safi’s bodily reaction. One clause drifts toward elevated register: “conceptual repricing of mercy,” but context justifies the chef’s meta-awareness after absorbing centuries of regret.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs: “Rain had just finished worrying the desert” sets weather, tone, and personification in five words. Metaphors stay coherent—coral ribs, brine breath—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm accelerates during descent, then slows for the kneeling beat, mirroring breath. Minor scaffold: “stored remorse like spice” is repeated conceptually but varied in image; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef is fresh, but grafting that gift onto communal guilt-storage beneath a thawing coral pavilion is outright invention. Risk: lyric compression could have slid into abstraction, yet every image is tethered to edible consequence. The final broth reconfigures battlefield psychology into cuisine logistics—an angle that feels inevitable only after it lands. No trope recycling; even the “ghost banquet” is repurposed as flavor laboratory.</comment>
