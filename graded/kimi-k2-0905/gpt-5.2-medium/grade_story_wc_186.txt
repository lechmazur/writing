<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The custodian’s obsession—“to prove that coincidences have meaning”—drives every tactile choice (wrapping the prism, fitting the hush shard, aligning the lens) and is paid for by the risk of staying alone; the interior contradiction between faith in pattern and fear of randomness is kept alive right through the final flash exchange, giving the character a credible, embodied arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sabotage memory → meteor shard → silence tool → star alignment → restored beam → answering flash; each step forecloses alternatives (the hush can only steady or swallow, the prism must be re-fractured), and the closure beat—“We were scraps…some accidents are invitations”—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with the felt cost of perpetual vigilance now shared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The salt flats, glass pavilion, and beacon tower are sketched with salt-cracked specificity; the humming ribs and prism cradle constrain the only possible repair site, while star azimuths function as both map and ticking clock, charging the final alignment with literal and metaphoric weight—environment directly shapes the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“is anyone out there to answer?”—tightens when each alignment glimpse shows tomorrow’s smear, turning abstract hope into a now-or-never lens adjustment; the cold tug of the hush shard enforces a single viable angle, forcing a trade-off between solitary safety and the gamble of revelation, with the answering flash crystallizing the cost: perpetual custodianship doubled, not ended.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme that pattern can be chosen, not merely found, emerges through the prism’s re-fractured light and the caravan’s mirrored code rather than exposition; the final image of “scraps” stitched by star geometry reweights earlier sabotage as invitation, offering resonant ambiguity—invitation to what?—that lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a salt-raw, contemplative cadence—“thistle-blown hope,” “maps were ash”—that modulates under pressure to shorter, instrumental phrasing while tracking star paths; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter, and the diction stays within a lone watcher’s lexicon, giving the prose a distinct, weathered texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent and ignition—long sentences for vigil, clipped fragments for alignment turns; figurative language is spare and grounded (“healed scar” of rainbow code), avoiding purple drift; only minor scaffold (“the moment I…”) repeats twice, not enough to dull the final beam image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon stories are common, yet the retrocognitive custodian who weaponizes silence to re-fracture sabotaged light feels specific and non-obvious; the synthesis of star navigation, memory-touched objects, and audible hush creates a fresh operational logic rather than ornament, making the salvage of meaning from meteor accident feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
