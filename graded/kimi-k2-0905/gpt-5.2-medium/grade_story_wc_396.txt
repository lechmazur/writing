<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “shadow-laced” nature is never embodied; her interiority stays abstract (“felt an argument…before any voice rose”). The climactic choice to stitch the ball and split the men’s duties is causally sound, but the cost is social, not personal—she never risks or loses anything on the page. The mirrored glimpses of dread/shame are vivid, yet Mara herself remains a calm conduit rather than a contradiction in motion. Still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible and drives the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reconstituted ball projects a living map that re-weights community courage; the fisherman and glaciologist are folded into shared duty with visible social cost (they must ride together). Causal chain holds: shard → mirrors → empathic map → redistributed labor. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (lighthouse → vintage store) and it’s legible. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse-orchard on ice is tactile: rope-braced trees, lantern glow, wind-gnawed postcards. Mirrors’ silvered scars and the widow’s button-prism crate constrain the literal repair of the ball—setting becomes tool. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track Mara downstairs, upstairs, counter, table. Weather and ice remain active agents, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. paralytic fear—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the shard must become a map or the floes will crush boats; the men’s opposed wishes force Mara to externalize empathy. Cost is legible: the two antagonists must cooperate on the same hull, risking mutual discomfort. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—empathy as navigable, reparable technology—emerges through the act of stitching light to shadow, not statement. Subtext lives in mirror-glimpses of fatherless dread and academic shame. Final image of apples picked “even for those who had shouted” reweights prior discord into communal inclusion without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Mara; perceptual signature is calm, synesthetic (“weighted breath,” “bruise of shadow”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during shard-handling, mirroring pulse. No dialogue is required; the single voiced line (“she asked for silence”) is motive-driven. Register remains consistent—poetic yet precise, never drifting into academic or corporate diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “she stitched light to shadow the way she had been trained” does triple duty (action, metaphor, backstory). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language spikes in the climax yet stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is acceptable within the story’s mythic tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ice-locked lighthouse orchard, emotion-salvaging crystal shard, and mirror-empathy repair synthesize into a fresh moral technology fable. The Accord Bureau’s failure is sketched, not explained, avoiding exposition dump. Risk lies in treating empathy as literal cartography, but the piece commits fully; the concept pays off in the moving map of human sparks. Not radically novel, yet the specific concatenation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
