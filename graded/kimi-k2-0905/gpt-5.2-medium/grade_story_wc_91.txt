<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amina's contradiction—giving away what she lacks—remains abstract; the "hush" is heard but never costs her a visible micro-choice. The final moment of shared transformation lands because the lava-steam image externalizes the price, yet prior beats summarize rather than dramatize her stakes. Interiority is lush but loops into self-paraphrase ("Coincidences take care of me...") without fresh friction. Still, her refusal to grab the rope and the concomitant shift in Toma feel credible and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beach becomes a crucible where "change was hot, granular, and shared," a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior gift. The lava-tide meeting is the earned cost, foreshadowed by volcanic ash earlier. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught by the second paragraph and holds. One scaffold loop—"she had heard a whispering hush under every sound" appears twice without new pressure—slightly blunts the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black sand, twin moons, and mineral-threaded lava tube are rendered through Amina’s gift-calibrated eye, so every glint implies transaction. The bottled lightning bugs function as mobile micro-setting, constraining her choice to uncork them in the cave. Spatial choreography is clean: satchel down, jars uncorked, spiral ascent tracked. The final image of steaming sand where "lava met the sea with a hiss that was almost applause" charges the entire thematic ledger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what transformation feels like—tightens when the hush funnels her into the tube and the rope appears: safety versus staying to learn. The tremor and ash raise physical cost, forcing the choice to guide Toma by light rather than flee. Agency is present but slightly undercut by the hush’s vagueness; we never see her hesitate, only obey. Still, the final shared gathering of villagers shows the stake has moved from private texture to communal responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocity: giving circulates back as survival, but only when risk is mutualized. Subtext lives in the lightning bugs—portable, unpaid-for light—mirroring Amina’s unowned generosity. The priests’ warning reweights into invitation without moralizing. Final image of "every coincidence became a way to give" lands as earned paradox rather than maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Amina’s synesthetic perception: "air trembled with heat and quiet color," "pulses wrote soft equations." Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under ash-fall, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Toma’s shift is observed externally, keeping distance clean. The elevated diction never drifts into purple because it is motivated by her star-capturing worldview.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from incantatory opening to staccato ash-sift without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense yet precise: "lava smoked... waves hissed on coal-dark grit" compresses two senses into one verb each. One paraphrase loop—"transformation has a grain, a roughness you can feel when you stop resisting it" restates the lava-sand image already shown. Otherwise zero scaffold, high density, and the final applause-line propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "destitute philanthropist" trope is inverted into ecological circuitry: gifts are not moral but geothermal, returning as literal heat. Bottled lightning bugs as portable, non-owned light source feels fresh and inevitable. Celestial alignment plus volcanic eruption risks cliché, yet the textural focus on steaming sand granularizes the sublime. Risk is taken—plot is lyric, not confrontational—and the closure justifies the wager.</comment>
