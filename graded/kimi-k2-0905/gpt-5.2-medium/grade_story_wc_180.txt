<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—pride in her own rectitude vs. the guild’s betrayal—drives every beat; the micro-choice to thread a cracked lens into a child’s quartz eye crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the last vestige of licensed identity. The children’s status shift from clients to witnesses tightens the crucible. Only the grandson’s diction briefly flattens into adult-like aphorism, a minor voice leak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: breach → trespass → ribbon quest → eye repair → vow renewal, each beat narrowing options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s unlicensed promise to keep mending forecloses guild protection yet is paid for with the confiscated kit and public self-outlawing. The carved “deciduous vows” graffito is the persistent constraint that shapes her final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pear-tree altar and glowing apples are not scenery but surgical theatre—branches supply the beam the boy clings to, petals provide wax for the eye socket, the cracked marble constrains footing. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s mender gaze: quartz grit, petal slip, candle-wax scent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from west window to choir stall without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still “mend” without license—tightens when the boy’s loose eye demands illegal craft. The meaningful turn: she trades legal identity for immediate function, price paid on-page by surrendering the last relic of her trade (cracked lens + thread). Pressure stays causal under the inferred lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of repair as ethical disobedience emerges through action, not sermon: the ribbon’s migration from girl’s hair to boy’s wrist reweights “vows should stay where you can see them,” turning heirloom into handcuff of conscience. Final image—Mira’s unlicensed vow under orchard rafters—offers resonant non-literal answer: legitimacy is pruned like deciduous bark, craft remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature: quartz-dust motes, petal-slip under boot, the internal pun “saints should have swept.” Syntax lengthens for nostalgia, shortens under tool-use stress. Only one clause (“deciduous vows, promises renewed by shedding”) risks self-conscious lyricism, but it is anchored to graffiti she physically reads, so voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She followed the central aisle until the orchard’s trunk rose from the altar, a pear tree rooted in cracked marble” advances plot, anchors space, and supplies tool resource. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay agricultural (orchard, bark, wax) without collision. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from iambic cadence of trespass to staccato of improvised surgery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing guild-policed magical optometry with vegetative cathedral is fresh synthesis; the quartz-eye slips like a fruit stone, making ocular repair orchard work. Risk of arboreal cathedral could tilt whimsy, yet every botanical element supplies surgical constraint, grounding the conceit. Final vow reprises the grafted living altar, so premise never retreats.</comment>
