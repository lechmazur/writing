<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s “infinitely patient” stance is dramatized through the slow decoding of knots and the refusal to plant the black lotus; the clerk’s shaken recognition supplies external proof of internal cost. Interiority stays concrete—fulgurite lens, salt-stiff rope—never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the final acceptance of public teaching is reported rather than shown in a micro-choice that hurts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed placed in the crack, the knot tied above it, the council’s conditional concession—cost is felt in the open exposure of once-secret knowledge. Causal chain holds: rope-reading → proof of identity → conditional victory; secrecy foreclosed, apprenticeship now public. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, snow, and dock boards function as micro-setting: the melt-filled crack literally receives the seed that seals the bargain. Fulgurite lens and salt-stiff rope are tactile extensions of body. Weather tightens the clock—third bell must be heard through fog—so atmosphere constrains tactics, not merely decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve rope language—signaled in first paragraph; pressure escalates when wire shipment looms. One decisive tightening: clerk’s recognition of his family name forces the public-teaching concession. Cost is legible—secret weavers must abandon secrecy—but the beat is slightly under-played; a sharper visceral price would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory stored in touch and knot rather than archive—emerges through action, never sermon. Final image of seed in dock crack reweights “storage” from vault to living cycle. Ambiguity remains: will public teaching dilute or save the code? No moralizing sentence mars the hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Lio’s perceptual filter: “listening as if the water were thinking aloud.” Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic patience; no head-hopping. Distinct idiom in Mara’s terse “not found by asking” contrasts Lio’s meditative cadence. Fulgurite, rope-shadow, and bell-sound form a consistent sensory signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “snow sifted…softening every rope creak into an oceanic hush” does three jobs in one breath. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent. One near-purple phrase—“quiet argument between order and drift”—is earned by prior concrete knot-work, so permitted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rope-as-textile-archive feels fresh, especially welded to fulgurite lens that lets scratches speak. Secret guild trope is inverted: they abandon secrecy to survive. Black-lotus seed that refuses to sprout becomes non-literal emblem of memory that must stay dormant to remain potent—risky, specific, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
