<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s nose-driven naming and Morrow’s grief-scarred intuition are vivid, but the final broadcast choice is confessed in summary, not dramatized; we feel the cost only by report, not by embodied refusal or risk. Interior contradiction is strong early (trust nose vs. fear path), yet the closing stance crystallizes off-stage, capping the arc just short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: leaf→riddle→cylinder→broadcast→camps answer. Closure is a Decisive Change with social cost: the settlement’s water-for-refugees trade is exposed, guards advance, voices close the wasteland—cost is legible in the tightening circle. Orientation is swift; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scrapyard catwalks, cooling bolts, phonograph grooves—each tactile detail constrains next move (cart path, decoding method, broadcast site). The wax leaf’s impossible red charges the final hand-off, reweighting “home” under antenna shadows. Environment and micro-objects actively shape tactics and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake—expose council betrayal—tightens once: cylinder reveal → broadcast → guards rush. One meaningful escalation suffices; options narrow as Sera’s life and Lio’s loyalty are risked on-air. Cost is felt in the advancing boots and Morrow’s bark, not merely declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth as scent, sound, signal—emerges through wax leaf, dog’s nose, cylinder groove; no explicit thesis. Final chorus of camp voices reconfigures “distance into closeness” without moralizing, leaving reader to weigh the price of communion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is saturated in olfactory idiom (“smells on sleeves,” “truth arrived with a smell first”) and compressed wasteland syntax. Rhythmic control peaks under torch-light decoding: long sentence coils, then staccato broadcast lines. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, world-rule, emotional tilt—without scaffold. Occasional poetic stack (“wind moved… wild hush”) risks density but pattern is taught early and pays off in mirror-reading beat. Zero loops, clear propulsion; minor purple flicker keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic phonograph-code, scent-based naming, and dog-as-truth-detector synthesize into a fresh intelligence-gathering ritual. The leaf-in-wax relic reweights “home” in a world where color is extinct—specific, non-obvious, inevitable once revealed.</comment>
