<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sava’s ache of being “unclaimed” and her offer to trade labor for kin-knowledge give every beat purpose; the moment she presses reeds into obsidian shows embodied contradiction—she risks permanent outsider status by claiming maker-status. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Final wrist-tying crystallizes her reconfigured place with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living reed lattice physically extends the kin-map and Sava demands to be named “maker,” foreclosing guest status with irrevocable social cost. Causal chain holds—each tag sighting tightens the council’s need, her reed markers accumulate, and the obsidian arbor’s reed impressions prove shared origin, justifying her leap. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tags + reeds reweights belonging until the final image reconfigures community space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal orchard, obsidian arbor, and reed impressions form a micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—she weaves reeds into the arbor itself, fusing material to social map. Sensory selection narrows to ringing fruit, crater glow, and scent of rain on stone, all filtered through Sava’s sculptor bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from crater rim to council fire to arbor interior.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when the council’s need for safe paths forces them to accept her offer, then deepens as the arbor reveals the artist is also fen-born, making her claim plausible but risky. One meaningful escalation: she shifts from helper to claimant, publicly dedicating the arbor as maker, narrowing her options to acceptance or exile. Cost is legible—she stakes her reed-craft and outsider capital in full view of the council.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “crafted kinship” emerges through reed lattice physically extending the crystal kin-map; no character states a moral. Final image of the loop-and-thorn reappearing on her own reeds reweights earlier tags as communal rather than elusive, achieving resonance without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Sava’s sculptor perception—she hears “ringing” fruit, smells “rain on stone,” and reads glass ribs as press-forms. Syntax mirrors her artisan precision: clauses cut clean as reed knives. No head-hopping; Oren’s and Ilya’s dialogue carry distinct cadence and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, reed, or kin pressure. Figurative layer is spare—only “wound trying to heal” risks purple but earns its place by reframing crater shimmer under council fire. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final arbor scene, then lands on the single-line declaration “asked to be named… as maker.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of marsh-reed craft with crystalline kin-mapping feels inevitable yet unseen before; the tag-as-invitation flips graffiti trope into communal engineering. Risky lyric compression taught in first paragraph pays off when reed impressions in glass prove shared provenance, reconfiguring loneliness into civic blueprint.</comment>
