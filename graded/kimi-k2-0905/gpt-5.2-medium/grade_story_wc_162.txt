<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip listening to wood, counting breaths against rings—yet the epiphany “sacred thresholds were not places but measures” is declared, not dramatized with simultaneous contradiction. The final renunciation (she builds her own maze of doors) carries visible cost, satisfying earned stasis, but the emotional turn is slightly too tidy for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corridor dissolves behind her, the brass plate reweights “necessary distances” with conceptual cost, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Causality is tight—logbook code → wood grain → wind corridor—yet the brass plate’s late arrival is a mild teleporting prop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and doorframe without walls constrain the leap decision; the micro-setting of the knotted bench plank literally maps time intervals that calibrate her jump. Sensory selection (warm brass, fractured hush) is filtered through Mira’s surveyor gaze, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she cross the threshold to find her father?—tightens when the seven-minute corridor forms; the price of a mis-measured leap is implicit death. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for this length, though the wind shift that dissolves the corridor is partly situational luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the iterative image of measured gaps: corn rows, wood rings, terrace leaps. The final reconfiguration—she builds her own maze of doors—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to “why thresholds feel sacred” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual signature—sound fractures like thin ice, distance as “a human promise.” Syntax mirrors her surveyor precision; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression (“featherly determined”) is taught by context and pays off in the silent landing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences while she listens to wood, staccato fragments at the leap. One scaffold loop: “necessary distances” is repeated three times in the last third without new inflection. Otherwise density is high; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The butterfly-effect city of sliding glass terraces and sound-trapping barnwood fuses speculative architecture with emotional archaeology; the maze trope is inverted into a calculus of ethical gaps. Risk feels organic, not gimmicky, and the payoff is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
