<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inez’s contradictory impulses—arithmetical philanthropy vs. secret sentiment—are dramatized in every beat: she orders a drought, yet cuts her own soles on the salt to follow a bird’s ghost. The final gesture of smashing the egg is earned by the prior micro-choice of carrying it hollowed and wired; the cost (irreversible silence) is felt on the page. Interiority stays concrete: “her throat tightened with a feeling she never let her lawyers see” shows embodied secrecy without label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the moral ledger remains slightly abstract—no single human victim is named—so the cost, though real, is one notch short of visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s shatter converts manufactured silence into remembered sound inside her, reweighting the premise that the world is always buyable. Causal chain holds: drought → cracks readable → arrival → cracked wafer → renunciation; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with salt flat, night, lone figure; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. The final image of wind carrying ivory shards along the crack-map is the exact sentence where cost becomes undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its glass-like surface cuts her feet, mirrors brokenness, and provides the readable crack-map that guides the pilgrimage. Micro-setting of the rusted survey stake at the dried pool’s center functions as altar and scaffold for the egg, constraining the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt taste in wind, distant thunder, needle-like wingbeats—never tourist catalog. Weather (impending storm) tightens the clock, forcing the act before rain blurs the map again.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she buy back her own guilt—tightens once: the recording wafer is already cracked, foreclosing absolution and forcing renunciation. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each act narrows her options from dam → drought → cracked map → cracked wafer → shattered shell. The visible price is the egg itself, carried since paragraph four and destroyed on page; its loss is irreversible. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence resolves anything—failure is engineered by prior transit damage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of “fractured grace”: grace can be broken yet still chosen, a non-literal answer delivered by the final image of shards traveling the flight-map. Subtext operates in gesture—whispering the birds’ name like a prayer—without sermonizing. No thematic echo sentence declares the thesis; the egg’s destruction is the argument. Complexity lingers: she will end the drought, but the moral cost is unwashable, inviting counter-readings on restitution vs. performance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Inez, filtering every perception through her professional coldness and covert ache: “the world feel briefly unbuyable” is a thought only she could have. Diction is precise yet lyrical—“readable scars,” “crude geometry of absence”—without drifting into corporate jargon. No head-hopping; the security chief’s voice is an off-page radio squawk, maintaining distance. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: long sentence of arrival, then staccato clauses at shatter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “she set the egg on the stake’s flattened top, flipped a hidden switch with her thumbnail” advances action, reveals prior tech smuggling, and primes the failed playback. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new information or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—salt like broken glass, wingbeats like needles—without mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; the final paragraph’s monosyllabic fall—“let it fall to release whatever echo remained”—lands like a held breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of climate-engineering villain and penitent pilgrim feels fresh; the drought is not apocalyptic backdrop but a deliberate cartographic tool to read absence. Specificity—storm-petrel of Kandar, wafer inside an extinct egg—prevents trope recycling. The risk of sentimental absolution is refused: recording fails, grace stays broken. Transformation test fails if names change: the bird, the dam, the salt flat are irreplaceable to the emotional calculus.</comment>
