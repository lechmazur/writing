<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marin’s contradictory impulses—gossip-column cruelty vs. exorcist restitution—are dramatized in the wire-loop beat and the cracked-bottle cost; the apology’s 3-year lag and orchard petition in drawer show flaw-driven stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted ozone and old pears”) without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (writing correction on score) is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked bottle / leaking scent reweights “imperfect miracle” with felt cost; apology is delivered, orchard fate still doomed, archive lights dead. Causal lens holds: because Marin mocked June, because she rigs copper loop, therefore fuse pops, forgiveness arrives as warm breath. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—perfume gone, archive power lost—shapes final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sheet-archive micro-setting constrains every move: warped shelves conduct current, fruitwood shelves once warmed sound, red paint outside ticks toward dawn. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marin’s exorcist lens—smell as map, metallic choir as conduit. Spatial choreography clean: bottle placed atop folio, wire clipped shelf-to-shelf, cracked glass leaks onto catalog notes. Environment charges final image: scent pool = tear, archive dark = cost paid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver overdue apology before orchard erased—signaled in paragraph 1; time tightens with distant chainsaws. One meaningful tightening: fuse pop / bottle crack forecloses second chance, cost legible in lost scent and dark stacks. Agency sits with Marin: she rigs loop, speaks apology, accepts imperfect miracle. No coincidence resolves; forgiveness granted yet trees still fall—escalation ends in irrevocable trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: words can wound like nails; apology pulls nail but wood stays bruised—metaphor made concrete via perfume tear on catalog notes. Subtext in gesture: cracked bottle = fractured reputation, leaking scent = forgiveness costly yet incomplete. Final image reweights prior mockery without moralizing. Complexity intact: Marin neither fully absolved nor damned; orchard loss stands beside archive salvage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice distinct: compressed lyrical noir (“half columnist, half exorcist”), perceptual signature tuned to scent and current. Syntax modulates—long breathless cadence for memory intrusion, short clauses for fuse pop. No head-hopping; interior access strictly Marin’s. Metaphor engine (“rumor is a nail”) stays in-character, paid off when nail-claw apology bruises wood. Register stable, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (“dust drifted like pale pollen through the county sheet music archive” sets tone, place, mood). Figurative language patterned—metaphors of carpentry, rivers, music—without muddle in peak beat. Minor scaffold: “she had learned… she had mocked…” could trim. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors at closure; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of gossip-columnist and spirit-exorcist trades feels inevitable, not gimmicky; occupational detail drives plot (copper wire to shelving current). Imperfect miracle concept reframed as journalistic retraction that cannot un-print harm. Orchard + archive + perfume bottle braid into singular closure image. Risk in lyrical density pays off—no safety middle, no trope recycling.</comment>
