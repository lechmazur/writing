<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam’s grief-logic is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (carving, oiling, timing the kettle) externalizes her contradictory need to keep Jory present while letting him go. The “hauntingly practical” trait is not a label but a working method that costs her sweat and splinters. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; interior arc alone earns the high band, though the final renunciation is slightly under-costed—her hands open, but we don’t yet feel what she forfeits beyond the panel itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each steam-beaded channel adds density until the ash circle becomes a charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—crystals clear, panel glows, grief is re-weighted into craft; cost is the irreversible dissolving of the only “time” she had left of Jory. Orientation anchored by word 60; single-scene, single transition (kettle boil) taught early and held. No causal break; pattern pays off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: the ticking glass both times her carving and mirrors the dissolve of crystals. Ash blank, brass whip handle, and kettle are tactile extensions of body; each constrains grip, temperature, and decision. Loft anchors without white-room syndrome; weather is not backdrop but metronome. Tool-as-setting charges the final glow of the panel—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert private grief into a transferable lesson before the kettle whistles. Pressure tightens as each channel cuts and seals—one mistake and the blank is scrap, the memory lost. No external antagonist; risk is botched craft and permanent silence. Escalation is textural—steam thickens, crystals cloud, options narrow to one last groove—cost is legible in the final clear-out of crystals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through haptic craft: grief is not healed but worked—loss becomes pedagogy. Subtext lives in the fist-to-palm gesture lineage; the panel will speak where Jory cannot. No moralizing; final line “build hands that open” is image, not thesis. The ash circle’s glow re-weights earlier beads of rain into an ember of refusal to close—resonant without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a circus widow’s perceptual signature: time measured in breath-holds, meat-cube precision, latch-check muscle memory. Syntax tightens under carving pressure—short clauses mimic chisel cuts; longer evaporative sentences bloom with steam. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A; internal diction stays within plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (“here and gone”) taught early and paid off in final glow—meets 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors steam cycles: clipped during carve, expansive during cloud. Figurative language is sparse and carpentry-specific; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“crystals cloud... crystals clear”—is purposeful echo, not scaffold. Information density high; every sentence advances craft, memory, or atmosphere—minor hairline repetition in “rain-beaded skylight loft” opener keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Crystallized-time carpentry is fresh; grief-craft stories abound, but circus widow + memory-wood alchemy feels inevitable here. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have drifted into gimmick, yet steam physics and chisel reality ground it. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic widow—circus rig collapse, whip handle, lion-tamer pedagogy are irreplaceable. Bold compression at 700 words yields charged poise without gimmickry—earns bonus.</comment>
