<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inez’s interior contradiction—seeking meaning in engineered forgetting—drives every micro-choice; the mandala, tile taps, and final laugh all spring from that tension. Social perceptiveness is shown, not told, when she reads the teacher’s jaw tighten and times her intervention. The boy’s smudge and her acceptance crystallize earned change with visible cost: the mandala’s destruction enacts the theme that meaning lives only while touched. No label-speak; body and chalk breathe motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush reweights the city’s erasure project into shared, fragile co-creation. Causal chain holds—tile flake teaches echo → proverb fragments → mandala reframes → teacher relief → boy’s smudge seals new stance. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“whispering grotto”). One transition (outside/inside) is legible; pattern of acoustic manipulation is taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone lilac, mist breath, and echo geometry constrain tactics: the grotto’s repetition forces the teacher’s brittle chant and enables Inez’s counter-mandala. The tile flake as micro-setting alters acoustic physics and charges the final image when its warmth meets the smudge. Sensory hierarchy obeys Inez’s artist eye—color, texture, breath—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: kneel, pour, tap, smudge track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared memory survive state erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Single tightening: proverb crack → hush translation → mandala map forecloses blank innocence; teacher’s jaw relax shows cost paid. Agency is attention and rearrangement, not violence; coincidence only complicates. Price legible: mandala’s deliberate spoilage and the lilac unease that lingers after.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from acoustic metaphor: forgetting is labor, not innocence; meaning is collaborative touch. Subtext in teacher’s tightening jaw, boy’s chalk sleeves, final smudge—gestures speak the thesis. No moralizing; the proverb’s soft return reweights prior erasure without statement. Final image of shared hush offers resonant, non-literal answer: memory is a held breath, not a plaque.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Inez’s perceptual signature—pavement birds, color-as-mood, social micro-reads—without head-hop. Syntax lilts like echo: repeated “lilac,” “hush,” “chalk” create acoustic pattern that mirrors content. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pooled,” “stripped,” “tightened”). Dialogue minimal but indirection perfect: teacher’s chant vs. boy’s blurt carry subtext. Voice stable under pressure; final laugh is in-character release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with mist: long sentence for echo, fragment for tap. Information density high—one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and motive. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“watered lilacs,” “Conceptual Repricing”) stays within artist POV lexicon. Closure image crisp: “meaning…lived while it was being touched, rearranged, and heard into a hush.”</comment>

<comment>Premise—state-mandated forgetting practiced in an echo cave—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tile flake as acoustic tool, mandala as mood map, hush as civic resistance synthesize new. Risk in quiet climax pays off: smudge over speech reconfigures power without violence. Specificity of chalk dust on boy sleeves and lilac mist anchors universals; removal would collapse the piece.</comment>
