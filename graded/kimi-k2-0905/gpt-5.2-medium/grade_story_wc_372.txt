<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilian’s meticulous care and private grief are embodied in every micro-action; the whispered promise that stabilises the slide is a credible, costly renunciation. Interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. personal need to remember—drives each beat. The final vow to “measure every fading illusion” crystallises an earned stasis that forecloses emotional retreat. Only the sister memory feels briefly expositional, keeping this just outside the 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer (cold, trembling light, emergent script) tightens the single stake—keep the vow alive—until Ilian’s own breath becomes the archival medium. The closure is a Charged Poise: the script steadies, the drawer slams, and the cost is the irreversible transfer of his own sincerity into glass. Causality is lyric but coherent; no beat repeats without deepening density. Orientation is taught by the ringing windows within 50 words, waiving any penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Archive’s frost, lantern dim, and crystal lattice are not backdrop but instruments: the projector’s hum literally transduces breath into preserved light, constraining the final choice. Quartz hush, cloud sea, and auroral ink mirror the fading vow while remaining meteorologically consistent. Spatial choreography is immaculate—case, slide, ledger, drawer—every object handled changes state. The setting charges the final image: the sealed drawer outlasting storms is the physical cost Ilian pays.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent one more promise from vanishing—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through each frequency peak. The slide’s warming and the script’s emergence constitute one decisive intensification that forces Ilian to donate personal sincerity. No coincidence resolves; the cost is the irreversible expenditure of his own luminous vow. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens, though a second external obstacle would have pushed this into the 9s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as a finite, transferable substance—emerges through the physics of trembling light rather than exposition. The final image of the drawer outlasting storms reweights every prior measurement into a meditation on archival ethics vs. human attachment. Subtext whispers in gestures: accepting the case “with both hands” equals accepting surrogate guardianship. No sentence moralises; meaning is crystallised in the quartz hush that bookends the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Ilian’s perceptual signature—lantern-blue dimness, frequency counting as heartbeat, cold that bites through wool. Syntax lengthens and quiets under frost, then tightens into metrical fragments as the vow stabilises. No filter-verb clutter; “he noted the peaks” is the lone summary, immediately grounded in the tactile act of ledger ink. Voice remains distinct even at peak stress, earning its place near the 9 band.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “quartz hush,” “slow ink,” “tremble in their light” each do double sensory-conceptual work. No paraphrase loops; every sentence either advances the slide’s warming or Ilian’s interior transfer. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass-light-frost matrix. A single adjective stack—“gentle, unfinished sentences”—is justified by the sister memory’s fragility, keeping line-level craft firmly in the high band.</comment>

<comment>The luminous-vow-as-archival-object is a fresh speculative angle; wedding glass becoming memory-battery feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Frozen cloud-library, frequency-based philology, and breath-to-light transduction synthesise into a singular imaginative stance. Risk—quiet lyric closure instead of spectacle—pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than plot. The concept commits fully, no safety hedging, vaulting the piece into the top originality tier.</comment>
