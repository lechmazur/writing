<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s quiet resolve and “hear the unspoken” trait stay embodied—he listens to mist, students, the mayor’s silence—driving every micro-choice. The pawn-for-sapling endgame crystallizes his creed with visible cost: the grove saved, his own fatigue and risk left on the page. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, the tin’s weight and magnet tug externalize motive. One hairline slip: the mayor’s interior turn is inferred, not dramatized, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mayor’s delay motion and the town-wide green canopy reweight the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—no single causal blow, but density and cadence shift force a new stance. Cost is legible in Eli’s exhausted vigil and the students’ dawn walk home. Causality holds: each window flip traces back to magnet clicks and Eli’s notebook. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist-drenched street are filtered through Eli’s tactical attention—every sensory note (ore tug, star hush, paper squares) constrains timing and concealment. The magnetic walls literally set the metronome; the mist amplifies quiet, enabling stealth. Spatial choreography stays clean from cliff path to council steps. One tiny gap: the exact distance between grotto and town is elastic, but it never affects choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the grove—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through the synchronized display gambit: each magnet click narrows options; failure means dawn exposure. The final green canopy flip forces council curiosity into a public delay, a visible price paid in sleepless students and Eli’s cradled tin. Escalation is accumulative, not reversal-heavy, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—“second thoughts as forest”—emerges from the chess-tree image pattern rather than any stated thesis. Subtext lives in silences: the mayor’s unspoken tree-climbing memory converts off-stage. The closing image of pawn-become-sapling reweights all prior squares without moralizing. One soft echo: “think again” squares flirt with slogan, but their handmade fragility keeps them from overt didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Eli, adopting his hushed, tactical diction—“cradled a tin,” “quiet combination”—maintaining rhythmic control. No head-hopping; the mayor’s shift is observed externally, preserving POV modesty. Syntax breathes with tide-pause cadence, then tightens during the SMS cascade. One clause drifts toward omniscient prophecy (“locals feared to name”), but it is brief and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, sentences double-tasking: “cobalt library seemed to float” sets tone and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors (watery stars, pawn-sapling) stay coherent, no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; only two near-adjectives (“quiet,” “humble”) risk repetition but serve thematic pulse. One tiny filter slip—“he heard the unspoken excitement”—would benefit from embodied cue, yet momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing chess strategy, magnetic geology, and grassroots light-protest yields a fresh civic-resistance vignette that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “amplified quiet” concept and magnet-timed rebellion are non-obvious yet wholly grounded. Specificity—Harbor Street, cobalt stone, paper squares—prevents generic anywhere-town. Risk in lyrical compression pays off: the grove’s survival lands as conceptual re-pricing rather than polemic.</comment>
