<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keir’s “serene anger” and “consciously wild” stance give him a sharp, consistent internal engine; the contradiction is shown, not told, in the slowed-time beats. His decision to stab the obelisk is the earned pivot that costs him the last of his ink and any written proof, so the renunciation lands with visible price. The only drag is that the Council of Hours remains off-page, so the relational crucible is theoretical rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: eclipse → raid → map → ink portal → obelisk → sabotage → return with data. Each because/therefore link is legible, the disappearing-ink rule is taught early and paid off at the climax, and the final note (“Time slows because someone profits…”) crystallizes the conceptual cost. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the camp’s reality is restored, but Keir’s epistemic weapon (ink) is gone and the Council’s motive is exposed. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wind-carved ribs, bleached canvas, and drone’s mechanical whine are filtered through Keir’s tracker gaze; every sensory pick is goal-driven. The ink pool itself becomes the micro-setting that literally swallows him, so environment constrains the final tactic. Spatial choreography in the canyon ambush is trackable. One hairline slip: “metal obelisk pulsed” gives no scale or anchoring silhouette, a blink-and-miss beat that keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why time slows—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Keir confronts the obelisk. The single meaningful escalation is the ink-portal choice that forecloses both retreat and documentary proof; the price (loss of ink, exposure of Council) is on-page. No coincidence resolves; the drone’s mapping is set up early. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; one tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—commodification of terror via manufactured crisis—emerges through the obelisk’s profit-driven time dilation rather than exposition. The final note reweights the premise without moralizing. The hummingbird drone’s data trail becomes the non-vanishing truth, a resonant counter-image to ink. A hairline deduction for the phrase “learn to be calm and angry at once,” which flirts with thesis-statement echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Keir; perceptual signature is taut, tracker-precise (“arrows hang in the dark as if the sky had become syrup”). Syntax lengthens during slowed time, then snaps back, a rhythmic corollary to stakes. No head-hopping; drone’s whine and ink’s vanishing are sensed through his skin. Voice modulation under pressure is exact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and patterned (“bright thought that refused to land”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-overwrite: “corridor of slow-moving dust” might risk abstraction, but immediate tactile follow-up grounds it. Momentum never stalls; every sentence advances image, stakes, or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of time-dilation tech with disappearing-ink espionage feels novel and inevitable; the Council of Hours weaponizing panic for study is a fresh civic horror angle. Risk—stepping into spilled ink as portal—pays off without gimmickry. Specific detail (drone maps pulse, knife finds ink-seam) prevents concept from floating into allegory. Transformation test: story collapses if any core gadget is swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
