<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s cautious-exuberant contradiction is embodied in micro-choices (lowering kalimba volume, opening palm) that cost her emotional exposure; Mara's silence-to-hum shift is credibly incremental. The locket as proxy for dead brother tilts every therapeutic decision, so the final whistle exchange feels earned rather than miraculous. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—even at the eclipse crest. What keeps it from 9+ is the single-scene limit: we glimpse but don’t fully feel the prior weeks of failed attempts, so the stakes leap rather than compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared hum reconfigures both characters’ options without dissolving grief, cost felt in Liora’s exposed locket and Mara’s first audible thread. Causal chain holds—permission is built beat-by-beat from drum invitation → eclipse darkness → hair-curl reveal → hum; no coincidence solves anything. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (clinic→grove) is telegraphed. Only a sliver off for the off-stage “weeks passed” ellipsis that skips a visible intermediate failure/cost beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is sketched via lived sense—cold sap smell, sharpened shadows under totality—yet every detail filters through Liora’s musical ear (pines as “low strings”). The Dreaming Roots micro-setting literally shapes the final acoustics that coax Mara’s hum; eclipse light change governs tempo choice. Proper-noun economy kept; no geography drift. Just shy of 9 because weather/eclipse physics is accurate but not quite constraining a later tactical choice—it’s more backdrop than lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can shared sound reopen Mara’s voice—tightens once: darkness drops, Liora risks showing the curl, and the option set narrows to hum or retreat. Pressure is textural-accumulative: sensory eclipse cues intensify rather than external antagonist moves. Visible price is Liora’s emotional nakedness; Mara pays with first fragile sound. Missing a mid-story obstacle beat keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges entirely through gesture—spoons ringing, two-note whistle—never named in thesis-speak. The curl’s reprise at totality reweights the motif from private grief relic to shared tuning fork, a conceptual repricing that reframes both mourning and music. Ambiguity remains: silence isn’t cured, only bridged. No moralizing final line; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Liora’s musical perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“kalimba like heartbeat,” “leaves seemed to lean in”). Syntax breathes with scene—long phrases for ascent, clipped fragments at totality. No head-hop; astronomer is externally observed. Dialogue is minimal but voice-differentiated (Mara’s whisper vs Liora’s two-note answer). A hair below 9 only because one sentence edges toward poetic overreach: “world clicked into a dim blue hush.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filter-verb stacks, no adjacent paraphrase. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (sound metaphors) so the eclipse climax stays clear. Strong verbs carry motion—“plucking gentle patterns,” “moon began to nibble.” Final line lands with percussive monosyllables that echo kalimba tines. Zero proof or continuity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of music-therapy minutiae with eclipse folklore feels fresh; the hair-curl as tuning object is specific, not symbolic cliché. Risk is taken in keeping the “antagonist” internal (grief-shaped silence) yet tension holds. The whistled answer reframes the dead father without resurrecting him—avoids sentimental shortcut. Not quite 9 because the solar-eclipse device, while gorgeously handled, is a known literary trigger; the innovation is in acoustic rather than visual use, but still recognizable.</comment>
