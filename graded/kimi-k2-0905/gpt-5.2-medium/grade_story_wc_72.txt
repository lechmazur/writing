<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ilyan’s guilt-driven descent and the Founder’s stone-locked vigil are both embodied through tactile micro-choices (threading cord, dissolving wax). The final renunciation—accepting nuance over certainty—carries visible cost as he rises “with the ampoule’s message,” voice now freighted with complicity. Interior contradiction is alive in every beat; no therapeutic self-labeling intrudes. The only bar to 9.0 is that the Founder’s centuries of loneliness are told more than dramatized, slightly diluting the shared cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: because Ilyan told a partial truth, the Founder summons him; because he threads the crack, he learns the mines belonged to his own court; because he sets the ampoule in the bowl, the fourth revelation rewrites his public lie. Each “because” tightens options until the only exit is to surface with the whole seam. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the flood was accidental colonial sabotage, not martyrdom—cost is the implosion of his prior testimony. Lens holds without wobble; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Salt roses, cracked dome ribs, and algae curtains are filtered through Ilyan’s lamp-lit urgency; every sensory note guides the next move—crack location, door yield, ampoule cradle. The garden’s pressure-forced architecture literally shapes tactics: structural weaknesses become the only path. Final image of “every empty fountain a throat” re-weights the city from ruin to witness. Micro-setting (foxglove-stained ampoule) charges the closing beat; only the surface court remains off-stage, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Ilyan replace one lie with another or carry the full, damning nuance—tightens with each revelation. The cord-threading action physically enacts the escalating risk: every yard of line is another structural betrayal documented. Fourth revelation (his court brewed the poison) forces an irrevocable public stance; options narrow to truthful confession or continued complicity. Cost is legible in the final ascent: he bears the ampoule’s violet script like a brand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accreted images of vented poison, foxglove-induced stasis, and threaded cracks: history is a living seam that splits under the pressure of simplified narratives. The Founder’s incisive kindness refuses absolution, insisting “accuracy for the living,” a stance that reconfigures moral weight without moralizing. Final floating letters reprice martyrdom as colonial cover-up, leaving the reader to feel the ethical aftershock. No thematic statement is handed down; meaning is sewn through the protagonist’s bodily choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person POV maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens underwater, contracts during surfacing ascent, mirroring pressure change. Diction (“bruised twilight,” “stage dust”) stays within a court-raised scholar’s lexicon. Founder’s telepathy is cleanly italicized as internal ingress, never ventriloquizing the narrator’s own voice. One clause—“bubbles stumbling from my mouthpiece”—edges toward poetic register but earns its place as embodied panic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, causality, or pressure. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “algae fronds holding still like curtains” serves spatial clarity before it beautifies. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“unspooled,” “cradled,” “spiraled”). Opening and closing lines frame the arc with sonic echo—“descending” vs. “rose toward the surface”—creating cadence closure without scaffolding. Artifacts do not appear; prose is publish-ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Underwater stone-telepath witness and foxglove-induced suspended animation feel inevitable yet unseen; the synthesis is idiosyncratic, not checklist-fantasy. The “thread through structural weakness” mechanic turns a literal flaw into epistemic method—fresh inflection on both embroidery and archaeology. Colonial-accident reframing of martyrdom offers durable socio-political resonance beyond twist. Risk is high—telepathy, statue POV, lyric density—but coherence never cracks, yielding a singular artistic stance.</comment>
