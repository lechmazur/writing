<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—needing wonder while denying regret—remains vivid and embodied; the baseball counter-weight rescue crystallizes a micro-choice that tilts empathy. The final refusal of the wallet shows credible, scaled change. One hairline slip: “empty chest” drifts toward label-speak amid otherwise concrete sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: erased heart → newspaper clues → labyrinth → save boy → testify. Each beat narrows options and the final renunciation lands with visible social cost (“carried no miracle, only a statement”). Closure is legible, lens stays causal, cost is on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory economy—ozone scent, algae air, lake glow—grounds every beat. The signed baseball functions as micro-setting that constrains the rescue and reappears in the throw, charging the final image. Meets 9+ gate: object materially shapes tactics and ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover empathy or stay blank—tightens at each junction; saving the thief is the first irreversible fork that forecloses mercenary indifference. Cost escalates from anonymity to self-incrimination. One minor slack: placard commands could carry sharper immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured mercy versus earned empathy emerges through action, never sermon. Final image of “statement” versus “miracle” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a hard-boiled cadence without mimicry; syntax tightens under pressure (“lake shimmered like a jury”). No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent. One near-slip: “wonder survived like a bruise” flirts with cliché but is saved by immediate self-loathing press.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty—action, metaphor, emotional tilt—without clogging. Rhythm breathes at beats: short pulses during hatch descent, longer coils for lake reveal. Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; only a single filter-verb cluster (“felt heavy”) but it coincides with legitimate tactile moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: noir amnesia meets underground mythic trial, anchored by newspaper steganography. Baseball-as-talisman repurposes sports relic into time-looped moral compass. Risky bioluminescent lake pays off by forcing visible choice. Transformation feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
