<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coachman’s vocation and filial inheritance give him a concrete, idiosyncratic lens; every micro-choice (decoding gull-calls, wading for silt) flows from that vocation. Interiority stays embodied—no label-speak—and the final renunciation of violence through gardening carries visible cost in the kneeling, the bucket, the chill. The only restraint from 9+ is that no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; he moves with steady purpose rather than internal split.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jetty blossoms against the empty sea, reconfiguring war into covenant with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt, ash, silt, seed) tightens the stake until the final image crystallizes. Causality is intact—gull-call → trench → silt → assent—no off-stage shortcuts. Cost is legible in the kneeling, the bucket weight, and the chill that answers back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, reef-ghost water, rusted casings, and lantern flames are filtered through the coachman’s professional eye; every detail either guides choice (where to dig) or mirrors internal shift. The blooming planks constrain footing and symbolize covenant, directly charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One hairline slip from 9+: the cave below the surf is mentioned but never re-accessed to anchor closure physically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a new covenant replace war—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each sensory accretion. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the gull’s Latin command narrows options to one trench; thereafter the protagonist’s agency is to pour, mix, and invite. Cost is visible (knee-deep wade, chill assent) but the pressure curve is gentle; no second reversal or trade-off escalates risk. Sufficient for length, but lacks the visceral price spike that would push 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of covenant-as-garden emerges through salt-to-sweet imagery rather than statement; no moralizing final sentence. Subtext operates in gull-calls and blossom-roots threading bullets—implication over assertion. The reef’s death and the garden’s bloom create plausible counter-readings: peace as fragile graft, not redemption. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; the image of blossoms folding/reopening reweights earlier salt crust into tentative renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a weathered, maritime cadence—“contracts carved on ship keels,” “Eel Speech”—distinctive and sustained. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound of shells, taste of salt, weight of silt filter every observation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under the jetty without register drift. Dialogue is absent by design; the prose itself speaks like a keel-carved contract—compressed, salt-cracked, ceremonial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but each metaphor (jetty as spine, horizon as scroll) serves atmosphere or choice, never ornament for its own sake. Information density high—one line often does two jobs. A single mixed echo—“vast blue dusk where the horizon feels like an unrolled scroll”—skirts purple but is earned by voice. No artifacts touch the final blossoming beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The reef-to-garden turn is fresh, and the ornithological divination method feels specific to this world. Risk is taken: a battlefield redeemed by bird-guided horticulture, yet causality and tone remain coherent. Details (gull Latin, Eel Speech, silt bucket) are irreplaceable; swap any and the fabric frays. Synthesis of military memorial with ecological covenant offers a non-obvious angle on post-war narrative.</comment>
