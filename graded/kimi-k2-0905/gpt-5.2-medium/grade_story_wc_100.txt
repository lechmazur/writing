<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marek’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is dramatized in every beat—he keeps walking, bleeds into his helmet, trades his own breath to wedge the lens—so the final endurance costs his body and future. The interiority stays concrete (“the road still holds footsteps”) and avoids label-speak; contradictory impulses (throw the lens back / keep it) coexist in-scene. One micro-choice—sealing the receiver with wax from the books—crystallizes his hierarchy of values: archive before self. The earned stasis (he surfaces cracked but having given the dead an address) forecloses any return to anonymity, price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single long sigh of the receiver reweights the entire quest—the distress signals were the unnamed dead, now housed. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical beat (lens beams stitching bones to surnames) tightens the stake until the stillness “sits beside me,” a Charged Poise that makes the cost legible without exposition. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“I am Marek”) and spatial cues remain coherent through impossible folds because the pattern is taught early (“aisles bending into angles no architect could draft”). No teleporting props; the lens, wax, and breath all track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop but tactical environment: wax-sealed books supply the sealing wax for the receiver, chained tables become obstacles that force Marek to occupy “the gap where there should be only water.” Micro-setting (copper wire from his suit burial-linen patch) constrains the final repair and charges the closing image—he surfaces with the cracked lens still strapped to him, proof of permanent address. Sensory hierarchy follows undertaker priorities: smell of lamp-oil and storms on glass, plankton that “refuse to drift away” echoing his own refusal. Spatial choreography survives the Escher fold because the text retraces the beam-path back to the rotunda, keeping the reader oriented.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give the drifting dead a permanent address—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each accretive beat: taps accelerate, beams falter, his ears bleed, options narrow to “brace it with my hands.” The final long tone is not luck but the cumulative price of his stubborn endurance; the library’s acceptance is earned, not gifted. One meaningful tightening occurs when the card catalog lists Marek himself as the last volume, forcing him to pay with personal permanence. Cost is visible (blood in helmet, suit seams whispering) and alters tactics—he sacrifices breathing air to revitalize the machine.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: archiving memory is a living burden; the keeper must house the forgotten even at the cost of becoming archived himself. The broken lens refracts this idea—shattered yet gathering light—its final cracked state in Marek’s satchel reweights the opening image of “rest a permanent address.” Subtext operates in gesture: the chased stillness stops running and “sits beside me,” implying the undertaker has taken the dead’s seat. No moralizing; the resonance is felt in the sigh that settles like a pillow, inviting the reader to inhabit the quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person undertaker voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: coast that has no coast, sea pressing with “patient, chased stillness,” catalog numbers stitched onto bones. Syntax mirrors pressure—long clauses that buckle into fragments when the suit groans. Patterned elision (“I should have thrown it back… yet”) is taught early and pays off in the final refusal to relinquish the lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under depth but diction stays within Marek’s lexicon (“smear of wax from the books”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening spondees (“tide seems pause”) give way to liquid anapests that mimic underwater drift. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs: “Light bursts, not whole but workable, and it threads through the stacks, stitching catalog numbers onto drifting bones” advances plot, image, and theme. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the maritime archive conceit without contradiction. Minor filter verbs appear (“I understand”) but are justified by the brass receiver’s translation moment and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of undertaker, drowned library, and lighthouse lens feels inevitable yet fresh; no template plot matches this archive-of-the-flooded-dead. Risk-taking—Escher corridors, catalog card dated in the future—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity because the pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity anchors the fantastical: copper wire from burial-linen patches, wax scraped from books, plankton that refuse to drift. Transformation test fails—swap any detail and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
