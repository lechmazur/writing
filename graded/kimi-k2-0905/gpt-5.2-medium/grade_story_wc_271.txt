<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mina’s survivor-grief is embodied in every beat: the drone-buzz freeze, the photograph crease as “ruined streets,” the decision to stay and label saplings with dates not wishes. Contradictory impulses—terror of sound vs. deliberate return to the cliff—play out in real time; the final act of burying the photo at the cypress roots costs her the last private relic, earning the stillness she seeks. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude. One decimal off perfection only because Dr. Harlow remains a polite cipher, supplying no reciprocal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mina chooses public endurance—stakes, windbreaks, labeled dates—accepting erosion as the price of growth. Causal chain holds: drone trigger → freeze → apology → decision to stay → burial of photo; each step forecloses retreat. The lens-light “pearl” image crystallizes the new stance with visible cost. No orientation or continuity errors; even the hobby-drone coincidence complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt-wind pines, glass pavilion lens, and the waterproof box create a micro-setting that literally anchors Mina’s choices. The cliff’s arithmetic—storms on schedule, irreversible loss—constrains her final act. Sensory hierarchy favors wind, taste of copper, creased paper under thumb: all pressure-forced. Just shy of 9 because the town’s social fabric is sketched rather than lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mina remain on the sensory battlefield that replays her trauma? The tightening is the drone reprise; she walks toward the pavilion instead of away, narrowing future options. Cost is the surrendered photograph and the public vow to keep returning. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; one decimal off because Harlow’s stakes never intersect hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—grief must be grown in public view, staked against erosion—emerges from labeling saplings with dates, not wishes, and burying the relic beneath a living cypress. No character sermonizes; the lens’s pooled light reweights the arboretum from refuge to ongoing exposure. Ambiguity remains: survival is not healing, yet growth is possible. Final image of two scripts on a stake offers concrete, non-moral resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that can still track pulse and copper taste. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under buzz—pattern taught and paid off. Diction stays within Mina’s bilingual botanist ear: “transplant shock,” “creases like ruined streets.” One hairline slip: “arithmetic” metaphor momentarily lifts into authorial register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake, image, or atmosphere. Figurative control is tight: “pearl of stillness” recurs only after earned, never overwrought. Reed-mat windbreaks, waterproof box—objects handled, not catalogued. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match fog roll without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing drone-strike PTSD with salt-cedar arboretum stewardship feels fresh and inevitable. The lighthouse lens repurposed as secular reliquary transforms familiar coastal iconography. Risk is taken in quiet refusal of redemptive catharsis; payoff is the charged stillness. Not quite 9 because the botanist team could be any research crew.</comment>
