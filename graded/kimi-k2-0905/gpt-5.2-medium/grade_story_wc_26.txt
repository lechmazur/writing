<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to a tactile stone while curating weightless dreams—drives every beat; the final act of handing the stone to the shadow is earned by this tension. Her “luminous regret” is embodied in the way she rubs the stone at dusk, not declared. The only bar to 9+ is that the shadow’s acceptance feels slightly too effortless; a sliver more resistance would have sealed the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the unbound shadow is given weight, reversing the premise that shared dreams must shed regret. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each petal-screen replay thickens the shadow until it can choose. The river stone’s transfer is the on-page sentence where cost becomes flesh: “the shadow accepted the stone like a heart accepting a pulse.” No orientation or lens ambiguity past 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Library’s inverted-garden architecture—blossom screens, vine ladders, milk-reflecting cloud sea—constrains action: Mara must climb and handle petals to project footage, so setting directly shapes tactics. The river stone micro-setting doubles as tactile anchor and final weight. One hairline slip: “pale blossoms opened when a new memory was cataloged” is the only static catalog line; every other detail is filtered through Mara’s dusk-noticer bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope without erasing grief—tightens when Mara realizes the shadow is shed regret learning to move. One meaningful deepening: the abandoned anchoring rite is rediscovered via silent footage, forcing her to offer her private childhood dusk. Cost is visible the instant she relinquishes the stone and her true name; that forfeiture forecloses her earlier nostalgia buffer. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “hope needs edges and weight”; no character ever states it—instead, the stone’s transfer and the new patrons’ stone-holding ritual enact the insight. The Library’s blossoms dimming “ashamed of their brightness” is subtextual admission that unbounded light erases form. Final image of one weighted shadow turning losses into “careful, borrowable light” reweights the entire premise without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude in sight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature: “sunlight thinned to amber and every stain of shadow gained a voice.” Syntax lengthens and breathes at dusk, then shortens under investigative pressure. No head-hopping; the shadow’s “speech” is rendered in gesture and drifting shadow script, keeping POV clean. One clause drifts toward omniscience—“the Library’s blossoms flared as if applauding”—but the image is filtered through Mara’s interpretation, so distance holds.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per paragraph—each re-used (“milk-reflecting cloud sea,” “stone like a held breath”) to build pattern, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (“She carried her river stone…offering it the only thing she had never uploaded: her unshared childhood dusk”). No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The shareable-dream library is familiar sf furniture, but the notion that unanchored regret sloughs off into a mobile shadow is a fresh, non-obvious consequence. The silent-footage comparison device turns archival research into visceral birth-watch, transforming exposition into scene. Risk—making the antagonist a collective excretion of unweighted grief—pays off because the closure literalizes weight as river-stone heartbeat. Specificity of “dusk noticer” and petal-screens makes the concept inseparable from this world.</comment>
