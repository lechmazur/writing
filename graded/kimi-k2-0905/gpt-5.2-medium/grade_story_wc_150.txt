<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—trusting work while doubting miracles—drives every micro-choice; her decision to stay and keep wandering crystallizes on-page with visible cost. Embodied emotion is specific (“apple smelled faintly of incense and soil”), never label-speak. The final renunciation of departure is earned by the orchard notebook beats and reframes diaspora return as ongoing motion. Only minor: her “warmly curious” trait is named more than dramatized in late beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the re-aligned sundial shadow proves time resumes after pauses, reweighting her life of interruptions with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—tremor forces climb-out → notebook discovery → decision to stay—each because/therefore legible. One transition (surface↔tomb) is clean; orientation anchored by word 80. No lens ambiguity; the final image fuses Accumulatively-earned pattern with Causal stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Catacomb-orchard is not backdrop: root corridors dictate excavation tactics, child-niches force escape route, clay from orchard beds becomes new mortar—setting constrains choices throughout. Sensory hierarchy obeys Liora’s engineer-eye: void vs support first, incense-apple second. Spatial choreography survives tremor; no floating rooms. The sundial-as-micro-setting literally charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore her own capacity to keep moving—tightens when the empty bier mirrors her interrupted past, forcing the choice to remain. Pressure escalates through physical collapses and the scandal risk that Sava voices; each narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits onward exile, accepts perpetual detour. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges concretely: restoration is not return but continued motion through fractured time. Subtext lives in objects—stopped pocket watch, notebook of unfinished pilgrimages—never authorial thesis. Final re-pricing reframes earlier travel delays as valid devotional acts. Ambiguity lingers: monastery may still fail, yet her stance is irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Liora’s perceptual filter: noticing voids before beauty, reading stonemason’s sun as map instruction. Syntax lengthens during excavation, shortens during collapse, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her craftsman lexicon. Father Sava’s sparse dialogue carries subtext of institutional fear without voice bleed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with scene tempi, no template cadence. High density—each line advances map, bone, or interior—yet remains clear. One mixed metaphor (“lantern of faith”) is minor and early. No loops, no scaffold, no overwriting in peak beats; closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing diaspora memoir with catacomb archaeology feels inevitable yet fresh; tomb-orchard image is new without gimmickry. Interrupted-journeys concept is literalized in stopped watch and notebook of turn-backs, not asserted. Risky structure—quasi-lyric accumulative shards—pays off in resonant final alignment of stars and shadow. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing meaning.</comment>
