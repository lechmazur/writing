<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronicler’s guilt-driven compulsion to re-survey the river is viscerally embodied; the trembling hand on the map and the accordion’s taped bellows externalize self-loathing. The decisive act—photographing the skipped latch and emailing the council—pays off every prior evasion with visible cost. Interior contradiction is sustained: methodical habits war with the need to confess, culminating in the platform lullaby that admits forgiveness is a process, not absolution. Only the brother remains a shade rather than a second on-page pressure source, slightly capping relationship-as-crucible leverage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: skipped inspection → brother’s death → three-week withdrawal → graffiti clue → photographing latch → sending report. The tunnel discovery and grid match supply the decisive tightening; the emailed photo delivers the Decisive Change with undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat—“the truth feels less like punishment and more like shelter”—crystallizes the before/after with felt cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station’s rust-and-ivy decay mirrors the narrator’s corroded conscience; every sensory note (wet-leaf smell, bellows sigh, latch silt) is filtered through the surveyor’s professional gaze. The map on cracked bench and the corroded latch physically constrain the final choice, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: platform → tunnel → bathroom → riverbank → platform. Only the river’s exact distance from the station could be nailed even tighter for full 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing another dam failure—surfaces early and escalates when graffiti redirects attention to the intake gate. The micro-turn in the bathroom (“START WHERE YOU LIED”) forces a narrowing of options: confess or remain complicit. The protagonist’s agency drives the climax; luck merely reveals, never resolves. Cost is legible in the public exposure of the emailed photo, though a sharper bodily risk or forfeiture could have pushed 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: self-forgiveness is a survey that never closes, only re-measures. The accordion’s taped wound and the river’s ceaseless flow reweight the meaning of “truth” from condemnation to shelter. No moralizing lines intrude; the final lullaby alludes rather than asserts. The graffito dialogue functions as thematic hinge without preaching, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a surveyor’s clipped precision braided with lyrical guilt: “my own truth keeps slipping under like a stone.” Syntax lengthens under medication withdrawal, mirroring unfiltered memory surges. The accordion’s single chord is rendered as “a thin chord sighs,” a perceptual signature unique to the narrator. No head-hopping or register drift; compression in tunnel passage is taught by earlier map paces, keeping elision legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy threads the ticket windows” performs noun-verb economy. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; metaphors (river living in the station) remain coherent. The only hairline slip—“the air smells of rust and wet leaves, like the river has been living here too”—edges toward overt symbolism, but the simile is grounded in POV perception. Closure line sustains rhythm without figurative muddle, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing dam-inspection procedural with raw grief memoir feels fresh; the graffiti oracle subverts expository confession. The accordion-as-evidence object and the map-grid clue transform familiar guilt tropes into surveyor-specific stakes. Risk in structure—single shard, quiet ending—pays off via earned stasis. While “return to scene of trauma” is common, the intake-gate forensic turn and public email reconfigure it enough for 8.5.</comment>
