<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation (“write obituaries for the living”) gives a sharp motive that drives every beat; the queen’s single concrete memory (ear-to-soil) crystallizes her grief and authorizes the projection. Interiority stays embodied—notebook, thread, shawl—avoiding label-speak. The final micro-choice—accepting the thread as compass—pays the cost of carrying her sorrow forward, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the red thread in the narrator’s palm reweights absence into navigable geography, cost felt in “mark my skin.” Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (salt, decay, hum) tightens the weave until the queen’s grief is re-patterned. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“palace hill rose”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. No causal breaks; even the magical “projection” is pre-explained by guild method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden netting, copper leaves, black river—each detail is filtered through the narrator’s cartographer-eye and later constrains the projection ritual. The carpet thread micro-setting literally bridges queen and narrator, charging the final image. Selective scent (leaf decay, sorrowful perfume) keeps pressure sensory, not catalog. Spatial choreography holds: bench → loom-stretch → shoulder warmth, no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn absence into map without reopening wound—tightens once: the queen’s whispered detail (ear-to-soil) forces the narrator to risk sharing his own breath, narrowing options from observer to co-bearer. Cost is visible: sleeve-brush, breath stutter, thread imprint. No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies accumulative design. Coincidence absent; all pressure arises from mutual need.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as weaveable geography—emerges through the carpet thread’s return, never sermonized. Subtext hums in the queen’s plain shawl versus palace lanterns, implying monarchy stripped to motherhood. Final image of “softness mark my skin” offers resonant reconfiguration: absence becomes compass. Ambiguity lingers—where exactly the son sails—yet meaning lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a mortician’s calm precision: “describe what had already left a person before the body did.” Syntax lengthens under emotion (“the palace itself tighten, a loom remembering…”) then contracts at closure (“a reminder”). No head-hopping; queen’s interior accessed only through narrator’s tactile cues. Dialogue sparse, indirection perfect: “write her son dead without killing him.”</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long loom-sentence followed by clipped “I tied the carpet thread.” Metaphors stay coherent—thread as bridge, absence as map—with no mixed vehicles. One scaffold near opening (“salt and coal smoke”) is instantly grounded by palace hill. No loops or synonym churn in peak beat. High density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—“obituaries for the living” via borrowed breath—feels fresh yet inevitable. Carpet thread as relic and compass transforms mundane prop into ritual instrument. Risky lyric compression taught early (“palace kept its last roses under black netting”) and paid off. Could not swap names or places without unraveling the weave; specificity anchors universality.</comment>
