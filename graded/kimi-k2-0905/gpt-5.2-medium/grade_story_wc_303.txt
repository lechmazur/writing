<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—archival loyalty vs. plant-loyalty—is dramatized in the moment she tips coffee, reads the crown-blotted future, and still chooses theft; the figs’ sap-rise warning gives her fear a body. The renunciation costs her career (blank report, envoy’s threat) and is earned by prior causal beats. Only minor slip: “dream” stays abstract; a single concrete childhood plant memory would crystallize the stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pollen spill → telepathy → fig warning → coffee omen → vent map → theft → blank report. Closure is a Decisive Change: the violin vanishes, empire’s myth is sabotaged, Sorell’s sacrifice visible. Cost is on-page: “signed it before the promise loses its glow” plus soldiers entering dome. Orientation crisp by line 6; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet walls absorb sound, making footsteps “apology”—setting actively muffles dissent. Vent shaft cold breath and midsummer heat create tactical avenue; garden terraces provide hiding crowds. Ice-crystal violin reappears as micro-setting that refracts starlight onto Liora’s choice, charging final alley melody. One hairline slip: “dark fruit” simile mixed with observatory breath is momentarily unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—living propagation vs. imperial consecration—tightens when figs show burned roots, turning abstract orchards into visceral loss. One meaningful reversal: coffee stain first shows coronation gap, second shows Sorell alone, forcing her to accept collateral damage. Price legible: she forfeits institutional safety and implicates Sorell. Could edge higher if envoy’s threat carried an on-page consequence beyond implied soldiers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—permission to propagate vs. imperial ownership—emerges through vegetal telepathy and the stolen ice-violin that “sings into shape by wind,” not decree. Final alley melody reweights earlier grandeur into small, illicit growth; no moralizing line states the thesis. Subtext in coffee-ground crown split by “thin white gap” encodes the theme visually. Only micro-deduction: “dream” is named, not dramatized, slightly diluting organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries botanist’s perceptual signature: sap-rise, thirst, green murmurs, basil laughing “sharp and sweet.” Syntax lengthens under plant influence, then tightens during theft (“slid the ice-crystal violin into its case”). No head-hopping; envoy’s menace conveyed through gesture (smile curdle) rather than internal leap. One clause drifts toward editorial—“empires do not like impossibility”—but fits Liora’s archival diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric density sustained without purple overload; each metaphor (velvet observatory breathing heat like dark fruit) advances atmosphere or stakes. No paraphrase loops; information multiplexed (“bitter coffee…grounds run” reveals future and status dynamic). Occasional elevated diction—“provenance indeterminate”—is motivated by bureaucratic genre. Final clause “bright as sap” lands clean, no mixed vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of vegetal telepathy, ice-crystal violin, and coffee-ground divination feels inevitable, not grafted. Perforated destiny concept literalized through vent shafts and sap-oozing choices leaks. Risk of blank report as act of resistance turns archival precision into sabotage tool. No close genre or literary echoes; the botanical espionage angle is fresh yet thematically ancient.</comment>
