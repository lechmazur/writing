<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory impulses—secrecy vs. the ache to be felt—are alive in every tactile beat; the final micro-choice (pressing the shard to his own cheek) crystallizes the cost of visibility without exposition. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that the child’s stake remains off-stage; the relationship crucible is implied, not tested under joint pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard’s warmth reweights “being seen” as “being remembered,” with the cost of permanent partial invisibility still legible. Causal chain holds: blackout → cabinet pops → fragment found → cached → reclaimed → self-applied. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of returned objects and sense memories tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library infrastructure (ducts, atlas table, pipe chase) constrains every move; the flashlight, inhaler, and card are not props but environmental extensions that alter Lio’s path. Sapphire hush and copper smell recur with shifting emotional valence, charging the final image. Micro-setting (tin, tape shard) functions as mobile terrain that finally presses back against the skin. One hairline slip: the “eastern windows blued” line edges toward postcard, but it is immediately re-grounded by the child’s palm on metal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—visibility without exposure—tightens once: the cabinet spill offers a tool that can either betray or transmit presence. The tape fragment is the single deepening that turns the abstract wish into a sensory conduit; cost is the irrevocable auditory imprint of the child’s sob now stored inside him. No escalation curve beyond this, but the length warrants only one meaningful tightening; the beat lands clean.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “libraries archive not only books but unattended grief”; the tape shard reprises this without statement. Subtext lives in gesture—palms on tin, cheek on metal—never translated into moral. Final image reframes prior caches as love letters to strangers, a conceptual repricing that avoids sentiment. One near-trope: “good ghost” line risks thematic echo, but librarian’s murmur is off-stage whisper, not authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, percussive cadence—sapphire, copper, click—that mirrors Lio’s methodical stealth. Syntax compresses under pressure (“He cached… he traced…”) then elongates at the dawn beat, teaching the reader the pattern. No head-hop; child’s interiority is implied through sensory spill, not ventriloquized. Distinct perceptual signature holds: every noun is something he could pocket, weigh, or smell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high—nouns double as tools, verbs as stealth actions. Figurative control keeps metaphors sensory (tape “jagged as a crescent”) and consistent. One scaffold loop: “pipe chases” is repeated in close succession; trims easily. No mixed vehicles, no filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered, letting the shard’s warmth do the metaphorical lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—“library ghost who files lost fears onto obsolete tape”—feels inevitable yet unwritten. Tropes (hidden guardian, magical object) are retooled through analog media specificity and haptic memory science. Risk lies in the quiet ending; the piece bets everything on temperature against skin, and wins. Transformation test fails if Lio is any other caretaker—only a crawl-space archivist could weaponize a broken surveillance reel as tenderness.</comment>
