<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—firm clauses vs. sky-open uncertainty—drives every micro-choice; the final unbending of the nib costs her certainty and is earned by the dramatized garden error. No stock labels; emotion is embodied in the dry pen’s resistance. The single-POV crucible holds; the courier flashback is a causal micro-choice that alters present tactics. Missing 9+ only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s soft click reweights the past as draft, the nib’s unbending pays the price of relinquished certainty, and the new wet-looking line is the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—every edit is a because/therefore ripple from the garden mistake. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“station that hung inside the gravitational anomaly”). No plot amnesia; the courier node is retro-causal, not convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The listening room, mercury reservoir, and bent nib form a micro-setting that literally constrains the final action—unbending the nib against the ruler. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: chirps, rustle of vines, blue thread of light. The anomaly’s time-pool is learned through action, not exposition. Stars shifting into unfamiliar constellations mirrors the reconfigured ledger, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can history be kind without erasure?—tightens when the anomaly’s new cadence forces Mara to loosen certainty to save the courier relationship. One meaningful deepening: the chirp’s vine-rustle compresses past error into present pressure, narrowing options to either unbend the nib or repeat the mistake. Cost is legible: the nib’s permanent bend and the blank signature line foreclose perfect authorship. Agency is contingent editing, not brute decree—consistent with lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of editing via tea and clear labels: kindness is a revision, not an erasure. The final wet-looking scratch reweights “draft” from metaphor to material fact. No moralizing; the universe’s soft click is implication, not statement. Ambiguity lingers—next interpreter may overwrite—yet the emotional aftereffect of shared lesson lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is celestial-archivist: signals as chirps, history as ledger, pen as trowel. Syntax lengthens under anomaly pressure—“time pooled like dark water”—then fractures into shorter strokes during unbending. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“vine across dry stone” returns as auditory image—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“looked almost wet”). Strong verbs dominate; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—cosmic archive where edits are made by restoring missed human courtesies—is fresh synthesis of time-travel and archival SF. Risk: dry pen scoring grooves instead of ink could read gimmick, but the bent nib becomes thorn-like, integrating botanical error with editorial tool. Transformation test fails if courier is swapped out—his tea moment is irreplaceable. Specificity of “mercury reservoir” and “exotic nib” anchors world logic without exposition dump.</comment>
