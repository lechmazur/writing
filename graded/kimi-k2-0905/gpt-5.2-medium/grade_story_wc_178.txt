<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nabu-iddin’s frugality, grief, and empirical irony braid into every micro-choice—re-using tablets, testing the tile against his own star logs, snapping his trusted stylus. The interior contradiction between data-faith and omen-need is lived, not declared, and culminates in a costly renunciation that forecloses his former identity. No stock phrases; body and tool use are specific and character-bound. The only restraint from 9+ is that the final beat keeps the cost largely symbolic rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror-face rewrites the sky on his palms, sealing the covenant by voiding his certainty. Causal linkage holds throughout—each schematic test tightens the choice until the stylus snap pays the price. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (tile, tablets, star charts) escalates until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass-roofed palace, bone stylus, and lapis tile are handled, not catalogued; each constrains action (tile fits a single depression, stylus must break). Sensory hierarchy obeys an astronomer’s bias—angles, cool darkness, the red point of Mars. Micro-setting (the sealed stairwell) becomes the crucible. One notch down from 9+ because environmental cost is more conceptual than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve empirical integrity vs. answer encrypted devotion—tightens when every verified sum drags him toward faith. The Mars-Lion deadline supplies a single meaningful intensification; options narrow to snapping the stylus or retreating. Cost is legible on-page: the destroyed instrument and the new constellations etched on his palms. Situational lens: external sky-clock forces the stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between measurable sky and immeasurable covenant; no character states it. The final image—palms become star charts—reweights all prior frugality into sacrificial cartography. Subtext operates in silence: the featureless mirror returns his gaze as sky, implying the unknown borrows human eyes. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no moral is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a measured distance matching the astronomer’s habit of calibration; diction (“gnomon,” “sighting tube,” “empirically ironic”) stays inside his lexicon. Rhythm lengthens during observation, compresses at the stairwell descent. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never externalized. Compression and elision (“with no thunder at all”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description folds into action (“he mapped each number to a star name… the sequence spelled a vow”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (mirror-face darkens to “evening water”). One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but reads as narrator’s scholarly overlay. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fuses Babylonian astronomy, magic-square math, and post-regime liminality into an unrepeatable cocktail. The tile’s vow converts arithmetic into devotional ransom—an angle not templated in genre or lit-fic. Risk-taking (faceless mirror, sky rewritten on flesh) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of copper nails, barley cakes, and linen from a discarded curtain anchors the fantastical in lived residue.</comment>
