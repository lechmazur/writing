<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maro’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived; the climactic confession lists facts rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses under fire. Still, his desire to “preserve wonder” is embodied when he pockets the box instead of filing it, and the final toll-booth legend shows earned change. The moment he names Sela’s greed aloud is crisp, but interiority elsewhere slips into synopsis. Enough cost is on the page to clear the 9− gate, yet the peak beat could carry more embodied shame or tremor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: box arrival → uphill trek → truth spoken → queen released → lights blink on. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s power returns only after public confession, making truth the new currency. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“river tollgate”), well inside the 120-word window. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the matchbox, sap seal, and queen core track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—“nectar dusk,” “thunder nets like veils,” “jars glimmered like trapped fireflies”—mirrors Maro’s pollinator lens without cataloguing. The tower’s storm-charge jars physically constrain Sela’s choices, passing the 9+ constraint test. Spatial choreography is clean: ramp, spiral stairs, control bay, all tracked. Only the brief “outside, lamps blinked on” keeps it from 9.2; a final sensorial snap from the revived drones would have sealed it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can wonder survive systemic lies?—tightens when Maro realizes the blackout is cover-up, not accident. The midpoint reversal (Sela’s admission) narrows options to speak or stay complicit; Maro’s truthful speech forecloses silence forever. Cost is visible: Sela’s public shame and Maro’s loss of comforting myths. One tightening is sufficient for 600-word scope; no coincidence resolves the crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pollinator metaphors: engineered drones forget their dance, humans forget their honesty, both need nectar. Final image—“truth, once spoken, can make honey of thunder”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Sela’s laugh and soft apology carries more contrition than her words. No late abstraction; every thematic note is rooted in the queen-core reveal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, pollinator-biased: “eyes flat as coins,” “wings fused, honey tanks empty.” Syntax breathes—long sentences for dusk ascent, staccato for drone clatter. No head-hopping; Sela’s interior is accessed only through Maro’s truthful blurting. One clause (“because candor was rarer than current”) nudges toward editorial commentary, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Metaphors stay pollinator-ecstatic yet precise—“nectar dusk,” “tiny projector bees spiraled out.” No filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Opening and closing lines book-end with pollinator light. A single adverb (“involuntarily truthful”) is accepted as diagnostic shorthand; otherwise diction is concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bee-collapse + grid-collapse + compulsive truth-telling, all braided through a toll-booth lens. The queen-core as living map feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk in making the climax a speech-act rather than explosion pays off because the world rule (truth opens seals) is taught early. No derivative echo; even the blackout trope is re-inflected through pollinator tech.</comment>
