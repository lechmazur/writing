<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iris’s anosmic aromatherapist background is concrete—she arranges vials by color, reads paper for fear. The moment she chooses to deliver the screw herself crystallizes her new identity: “a repaired object carried a message more honest than words.” Interior contradiction (need to heal others vs. absence of her own healing sense) stays active. Cost is felt when she admits she still “trembles,” yet walks anyway—Earned Stasis with price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: broken screw → fear of blame → Iris decodes subtext → delivers repair → father’s gratitude re-stitches the household. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drop of the water clock reweights her empty sense into “still unveil miracles.” Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens drift. Cost legible in final line—“never enough to boast.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fog, brass gears, wet glass, and the midwife’s cold scrub-basin are filtered through Iris’s visual bias after smell-loss. The clamp’s one-sided candle rust and the water-clock’s soft ring constrain choices: Iris reads emotion off surfaces because she must. Final image—“drop ring inside Maro’s clock”—mirrors her internal cadence. Setting charges closure; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Iris still “heal” without scent? Pressure tightens when she confronts Aster’s fear of professional blame. One meaningful turn: father’s question converts potential accusation into gratitude, foreclosing Iris’s self-doubt with visible social cost (Aster’s reputation saved). Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—perception beyond the obvious—emerges through screw, fog, and blank olfaction, never named. Subtext in steam-veiled glances and untasted tea carries more meaning than dialogue. Final reconfiguration: miracles are “ordinary” once truly seen. No moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Iris’s visual synecdoche: “reddish tarnish only on one side,” “shaky spaces where a hand had paused.” Rhythm lengthens under fog, shortens during screw delivery. No head-hop; diction stays within her trained yet grieving lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fog-soft rolls to staccato observations; no template cadence. Figurative layer selective—“pale silhouettes,” “swallowed words”—never clogs high-pressure beats. Information dual-loaded: “clean, frightening blank” reveals symptom and emotion. Zero loops or scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Anosmic aromatherapist decoding emotion via stationery and corroded surgical steel feels fresh and specific. The water-clock shop as confessional hub is an organic frame, not gimmick. Risk in quiet miracle-unveiling pays off. Could swap town names, but Iris’s scent-loss lens would still differentiate the tale; transformation present.</comment>
