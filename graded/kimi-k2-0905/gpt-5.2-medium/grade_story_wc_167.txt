<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s quiet, glass-attuned interiority is vivid and consistent; his “noctilucent reckonings” and pond-geometry divination give a memorable perceptual signature. The inspector’s late pivot is sketched more than dramatized, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites—status shift is declared, not staged. Still, Ilya’s final micro-choice (installing plain glass, not prism) crystallizes his value hierarchy with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn demolition sheet and the steady horizon in plain glass reweight the bay’s future with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—stone-thrown interference pattern → inspector’s reframed stance—without off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is swift; lens (Situational→Conceptual) is taught by 25 % and stable at exit. Only the inspector’s reversal lacks a preceding beat of visible internal struggle, a hairline slip keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium, wet boots, and salt-stung beams are filtered through Ilya’s glass-eye POV; every sensory pick serves theme (refraction vs. plain light). The pond’s ripple lattice literally constrains the inspector’s decision, meeting the 9+ gate. Fog, tide breath, and gull cry evolve with the beat, never stall momentum. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating bodies or prop jumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the atrium from erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the inspector admits the notice is marina-driven. The pond demonstration forces stance crystallization: interference pattern becomes moral argument, foreclosing the “efficient calm” option with on-page conceptual cost. No coincidence rescues; escalation is a single deepening that reweights meaning. Meets 9+ quick test for agency-driven pressure with visible price.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refracted light vs. plain transparency: value of ordinary labor and overlap over monetized stillness. Subtext lives in gesture—inspector’s wet boots, the torn sheet—never sermon. Final image of the horizon held steady in common glass offers a resonant, non-literal answer, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No late thematic echo or moralizing paragraph intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance that matches Ilya’s meditative precision; diction (“lead came,” “noctilucent”) stays within his artisan lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for dawn, clipped clauses for inspection—without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping; inspector’s interior is implied through body language, not ventriloquized. Voice remains distinct under pressure, meriting high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the roof beams creaked, but as he set the pane… fog thinned” advances action, setting, and metaphor in one flow. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (ripples as lead came). A single near-miss: “appetite to erase anything” edges toward abstraction, but context grounds it. Closure beat is clean, no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combining glazier craft, ripple-divination, and bureaucratic inspection feels fresh and specific; transformation test fails if relocated to any other trade or place. Risk is taken—quiet lyric activism via geometry—yet coherence never frays. Slight dock for echo of “read between lines” prompt phrasing, but usage is justified by Ilya’s literal glass-reading habit. Overall, a memorable, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
