<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira’s embodied patience and micro-choices (bending knees, matching orchard cadence) make interiority concrete; the heartbeat-map motive is consistent and drives every beat. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she moves from patience to sealing without an on-page moment where doubt or alternative desire collides with the goal—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the final renunciation (binding the map to the well, foregoing personal escape) carries visible cost under the Accumulative lens and is earned by her prior ritual precision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each patterned arrangement of refuse thickens the stakes of “translating pulse into map” until the flash-paper transfer crystallizes the constellation; closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing plate sealed to the well reconfigures stillness as shareable resource. Causality is lyric-forward yet coherent: the orchard’s frozen sap sets the tempo, the mica spark fixes the map, the wax seal prevents leakage. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (subarctic crater, withered orchard, Eira named). Cost is legible in the final image: starlight locked under ice, Eira’s knees aching, aurora’s fractional loosening—she forfeits immediate use for future others.</comment>

<comment>Environment is not backdrop but metronome: failed sap movement dictates Eira’s gait; ice-capped well becomes the sealing substrate; orchard rows supply the spoon-lens-wire array that literally shapes the star-map. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through alchemical attention—sound of sap, bite of etched stars, blue glow without source—mirroring her patience ethic. Micro-setting (plate pressed to flash paper, wax traced around edge) constrains the decisive action and charges the final image. No spatial drift; every object is tracked from retrieval to final placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: create a living map so others can navigate by heartbeat during global breath-hold. Escalation is textural: each discarded item laid into spiral/radial pattern increases density until the flash-paper flare fuses refuse constellations onto the plate; the seal narrows options—once wax binds plate to well, the map is no longer portable. Cost is the forfeiture of personal escape; the tightening is single but decisive. No reversal, yet the aurora’s fractional shift signals external acknowledgment of the internal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: stillness as transmissible technology against apocalyptic panic. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through spoon-path, heartbeat intervals, and the final sealed glow. The sleeping child etched on the plate reappears in the stranger’s fogged breath—quiet suggestion that the next generation inherits the paused moment. Ambiguity is preserved: world may never exhale, yet the map offers shared pause rather than salvation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eira’s perceptual signature—alchemy-time, joint-ache patience, refusal of numeric speech. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual pacing; no head-hop. Cartographer’s arrival is rendered only through Eira’s gesture (spoon path north), maintaining distance. Diction stays within alchemical lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Voice is distinctive and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and tactical information (“flash-paper flare without smoke” fixes image and stakes in one stroke). Metaphors are coherent—constellation of refuse, starlight as seed—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences begin “She…” in the sealing beat, but rhythm recovers. No loops or synonym churn; closing line (“aurora…moved a fraction”) lands with precise cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses climate-stillness, alchemical cartography, and refuse-as-constellation—fresh synthesis rather than trope twist. The heartbeat-map offers a non-obvious answer to global panic: share the pause, don’t fix the sky. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off in the glowing plate seal. Removing any core ingredient (orchard metronome, spoon array, flash-paper transfer) collapses the logic; specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
