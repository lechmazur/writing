<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—equations vs. longing—grounds every beat; the shell test and hand-clasp are micro-choices that visibly cost. Toma’s shift from Academy envoy to co-conspirator is sketched more than dramatized, muting relationship pressure. Still, the final “we will be our own measure” crystallizes a shared renunciation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: warning → refusal → shell-ritual → ground-level constellation that forecloses licensing. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—light returned as un-patentable protest—cost legible in “they cannot patent what you give back.” One transition (Academy watchers) is cleanly handled; orientation never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus breathes through every beat: fissure heat warms wrists, mica dust sticks to fingers, spiral grooves meter solar dust. The shell’s micro-topography becomes the decisive constraint that tints each sun; setting literally filters choice. Spatial choreography across basalt ribs is exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep suns free—tightens once: licensing threat becomes real when Toma refuses to sign. Escalation is single but sufficient: each sun passed through the shell increases visible risk until the constellation locks the choice. Cost is the forfeiture of Lio’s barter-economy gratitude model, now impossible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—freedom as uncommodifiable light—emerges through the shell’s spectrum and the final un-patentable constellation; no moralizing line states it. The nautilus reweights from curiosity to covenant, letting subtext carry the ethical pivot. Ambiguity lingers: Academy may still retaliate, but the re-pricing is done.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays latched to Lio’s perceptual filter: copper twilight, tuned-bell hum, equations mixed with longing. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under threat; no head-hop. Compressed lyric diction (“pocket-sun alchemist”) is taught early and paid off in the final shell-release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes with scene heat: cavernous sentences pool, then snap at finger-snap release. Figurative density is high but patterned—light as vow, spiral as choice—never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Clean copy; pronouns track across two male leads without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pocket-sun alchemy fused with nautilus spectroscopy feels fresh; concept commits fully, no retreat. The protest-via-constellation turn is an inevitable synthesis of prior physics and ethics. Risk—lyric compression inside hard-SF premise—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
