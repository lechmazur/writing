<comment>Mira’s practiced detachment cracks only once—when she channels her own shame into the petal—making the final choice feel earned. The micro-choice to inscribe Orin’s brother’s name on the case lid crystallizes her cost. Interiority stays concrete (“static made truth loud”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the phrase “absurdly for a woman who sold fakes” edges toward self-diagnosis under peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s renunciation of untouchability is visible in the carved name and the coins she still accepts—cost is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: because she senses the buried guilt via static, she risks substituting her own shame for product, therefore forfeiting her emotional anonymity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>The amber grotto isn’t backdrop—it exudes resin that literally finishes miners’ lungs, forcing the need for a final emotion and tightening the clock. The blotter petal drinks the fumes on-page, binding setting to method. Spatial choreography is clean: ledge, pool, cross-legged Orin, case lid—no drift. Environment constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver an emotion that lets Orin die human—is signaled early and sharpened by the grotto’s lethal amber. One meaningful tightening: Mira’s shift from selling absolution to surrendering her own shame forecloses her professional detour. Cost is legible: she keeps the resin-slick coins anyway, permanently staining her self-exemption. Agency remains hers; coincidence merely complicates.</comment>

<comment>Theme—counterfeit empathy can become real only when the dealer pays with personal shame—emerges through the petal’s re-pricing, never stated. The blotter’s final bitter scent reweights every prior “distilled smile” vial without exposition. No moralizing line intrudes; the carved name alone carries the conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers: she still takes the money, leaving the reader to decide if redemption is partial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is textured, synesthetic, and consistent: “bottled honey,” “cracked compass,” “lantern under his ribs.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under static crackle, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored in Mira’s charged fingertips. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual (“Tell me what you remember” functions as demand and absolution).</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but never purple: each image does double duty (amber as both beauty and terminal clock). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative logic stays coherent—static electricity as lie-detector is maintained without mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“I could hear… I could have sold”) appears mid-scene, not in closure beat, so 9+ remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “counterfeit emotion dealer” premise feels fresh because the mechanics—static-charged petal absorbing grotto fumes—are grounded in sensory procedure rather than gimmick. Shame-as-ingredient reframes the empathic con artist trope into moral alchemy. Risk: merging personal shame into product could read as sentimental, yet the story keeps cost visible in the resin-stained coins. Specificity of amber lung disease makes the world inseparable from this plot.</comment>
