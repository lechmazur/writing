<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jora’s interior contradiction—distrust of prophecy yet hunger to guide—drives every micro-choice; the vow born of her father’s fatal certainty anchors her refusal to obey the Warden and is paid for by the one-page compression itself. The kingfisher quill, pocketed “bones” of data, and conditional syntax all externalize her hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is felt when she trades the safety of authoritative certainty for the vulnerability of inviting revision. The only bar to 9+ is that the Warden’s pressure, though present, stays largely verbal; a sharper status shift on-page would have crystallized the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the charter’s conditional sentences reweight governance from obedience to iterative testing, with the visible cost of Jora’s childhood trauma and the persistent constraint of the single page. Causal linkage holds throughout: because she models ignorance, she can shift sled routes; because she writes contingencies, the villages survive and the Warden converts. The lens is Causal; every beat advances by therefore or because. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words. The ending image of elders arguing over data reconfigures social meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen lake, obsidian spire, and wind-cut measurements are not backdrop but data sources that constrain the model and thus the charter. The kingfisher quill recurs as both tool and tactile reminder of risk, its blue-barred flash charging the final dip. Spatial choreography is immaculate: threshold, chart room, shore loop, threshold again. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and final image—no 9+ only because the salt-shed locations are named, not walked, so the micro-setting’s bodily pressure is slightly less visceral than the abstract grid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—regional survival via adaptive knowledge—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the model demands public admission of uncertainty. The single meaningful escalation is the shift from secrecy (model alone) to shared contingency (conditional charter); this narrows Jora’s personal option to hide and raises social cost. Price is legible: she risks credibility and relives her father’s fatal certainty in reverse. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—uncertainty as civic strength—emerges through conditional syntax, salt-shed placement, and the final image of elders arguing over data. Subtext lives in the quill’s “honest hand” disclaimer and the Warden’s frosted beard: tradition literally thawing. No moralizing; the reweighting is performed, not stated. The conditional sentence itself becomes the thematic engine, reconfiguring governance from decree to dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Jora’s perceptual signature—numeric “bones,” wind-cuts, vellum grids—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under pressure then snaps into conditional clauses, mirroring model compression. Diction remains within her cartographic lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. The Warden’s dialogue carries frost in its formality, distinct from Jora’s interior precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphor, and causal push (“numbers that felt like bones warmed in her pocket”). Figurative layer is sparse, taught early (“dull mirror beneath the obsidian spire”), and paid off when the lake cracks open. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, stakes, or texture. A single near-miss—“conditional sentences” repeated in adjacent clauses—drops the tenth of a point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ignorance-cartographer premise is fresh, yet grounded in lived procedural detail: counting fishers’ lights, shifting sled routes two miles east. The one-page constraint flips from bureaucratic choke to innovation catalyst—risk that pays off. Transformation test fails if quill, model, or conditional syntax is swapped; they are inseparable from narrative logic. The final reconfiguration of governance feels inevitable yet non-obvious, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
