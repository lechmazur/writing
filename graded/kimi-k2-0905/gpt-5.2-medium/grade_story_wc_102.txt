<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the unspoken vs. releasing it—are dramatized in embodied breathwork under live pressure; the final renunciation is earned by the prior camera-vision causality and costs her the ember-knot she had hoarded, visible in the sternum release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><closure>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the knot behind the sternum loosens on-page as petals darken on the pilgrim’s coat—felt cost is legible, the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the breathing cadence reweights all prior imagery without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct’s flowering iron, wisteria petals, and fog-bound lamps are not backdrop but active optics that refract the camera’s projection; the micro-setting of the sternum-as-corridor directly constrains the final breathing choice, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—where unused love is stored—tightens through the single breathing-deepening beat that forecloses hoarding; the price (loss of the ember-knot) is visible on-page, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete breathing optics rather than assertion: love as current, not artifact; the final flare inside the camera re-prices every prior withheld call, offering a non-literal answer that resists moralizing while remaining unmistakable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a consistent psychic distance, filtering perception through Mara’s camera-trained eye; patterned elision (“revealing through breathing changes”) is taught early and paid off at closure without register drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence layers image, breath, and emotional stakes; figurative language is selective, never clogs the peak beat, and the final flare sentence propels the release without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The camera-obscura-as-heart, spark-pilgrim, and breath-developed rib-corridor synthesize fresh optics on the hackneyed “let go” arc; the risk of mystic tech pays off because the mechanics are tied to breath causality and charge the ending image.</comment>
