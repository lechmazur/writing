<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—needing shine to sell sincerity while craving unvarnished truth—drives every beat; the fern’s physical reaction externalizes the flaw without label-speak. The final choice to confront Lio with “one clean question” is earned because her prior micro-choices (trading a truthful line for directions, writing un-gilded paper) have already foreclosed the option of continuing to hide behind gold. Cost is visible: she abandons the craft that pays rent and risks the cistern to regain her brother. Only the brother’s off-page silence keeps this from full 9-band immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dried oasis → lost letters → map under floorboard → conduit → cistern truth; each because/therefore step narrows Mara's options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city “felt answerable” because her un-gilded admission re-weights every prior transaction of words. Cost is legible in the final image—she carries no gold, only the zinc seal and a question that could lose her both water and sibling. The shredded map’s late reveal is the single teleport, but it is seeded by the postal fragment found first.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass biodome corridors, algae canals, and paper-jellyfish tubes are sketched with sensory economy; every descriptor either blocks or enables movement. The zinc seal’s cold metallic scent and the fern’s frond-twitch are micro-settings that decide whether Mara proceeds. Final hatch image re-uses “warm air carrying rain the city no longer owned,” charging the closure with conceptual cost. Only the outer-domes cistern remains off-page, preventing full 9.0 environmental constraint at the final instant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where do lost conversations go?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when Mara learns the conduit composts lies into breathable air; her truthful note suddenly threatens the city’s literal atmosphere. One meaningful escalation: writing on plain paper clears the floating tubes, foreclosing her former gilded livelihood. Price is felt immediately: Sable stays upright, but the guild’s air supply could collapse if she re-opens the cistern. The stakes stay personal yet ripple outward, satisfying 8-band pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of “shine” as societal anesthesia; gold leaf becomes a metaphor for every cosmetic half-truth that keeps the domes breathing. Subtext lives in gesture: the fern’s droop is a silent indictment of every too-quick worker smile. Final image—Mara practicing the unadorned question—re-prices language itself without moralizing. Only a hair of ambiguity remains whether the cistern water is real, holding the score just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: she “reads patterns” in vellum shards and notices ozone scent because her livelihood depends on ink. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“paper scraps floated like jellyfish”) then fractures when she decides (“one clean question”). No head-hopping; Archivist Rull’s dialogue is filtered through her need. The rhythmic final sentence—“the city felt answerable”—is earned by the voice’s prior compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “conversations evaporated without a last line” does double world-and-character work. No mixed metaphors; the spiraled sap arrow, zinc click, and fern frond create a consistent tactile lexicon. One scaffold loop—“she reread the map scraps… reread the fragments”—is forgiven because the repetition mirrors her obsessive search. No artifacts touch the final beat, keeping 9-band eligibility intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dead-letter conduit that composts unsaid words into air is a fresh synthesis of climate-crisis SF and epistolary ghost-story tropes. The fern-as-lie-detector object could have been twee, but here it determines plot access and is integrated into the city’s life-support economy. Risk is taken by making the protagonist’s climactic act the refusal to use her own lucrative skill; the story commits fully to that inversion. Specificity of gilded wedding vows versus un-gilded confession makes the concept irreplicable.</comment>
