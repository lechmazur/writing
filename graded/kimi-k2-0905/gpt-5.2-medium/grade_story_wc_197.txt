<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “smallness as cover” is dramatized in every beat—trading batteries, copying seals, risking the booth—so the underestimated trait is lived, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete (“door in her chest opening”) and her final choice to swap printing plates is earned by the prior watermark clue. The courier’s brightened gaze supplies external confirmation of her agency, but the story keeps the spotlight on her micro-choices. One hairline slip: the ledger voice summarizes her erased lives rather than letting her react beat-by-beat, a minor flattening that keeps this just outside the 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: failed courier → locked safe-house → booth key → switchboard intel → watermark clue → plate theft → lagoon release. Each “because” tightens options; the Ministry’s rewriting is the persistent antagonistic force. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: the sirens converge while the true pages float away, indelibly reweighting tomorrow’s text. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (Archive Ministry revision) and geography tracks throughout; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Meridian booth half-buried in auric lagoon sand is not backdrop but tactical linchpin: its obsolete lock accepts the key, its switchboard leaks the watermark clue, its cord becomes literal lifeline. Puddle-map method, brass key, and gold ripple code are sensory, selective, and filtered through Mara’s furtive attention. Spatial choreography is flawless—alley → waterfront → booth → truck → lagoon—every distance walkable under pursuit. Environment constrains the final act: only the lagoon’s reflective surface can broadcast the constellation watermark, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“refuse erasure”—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates from pamphlet smuggling to stealing the actual printing plates, a meaningful jump in risk. The midpoint switchboard reveal that “she should have been dead” tightens pressure under causal lens; options narrow to either vanish or overwrite the Ministry’s plates. Cost is visceral: sirens closing, courier’s raw wrists, pages drifting into uncertain hands. One beat more of physical jeopardy inside the truck could have pushed this into the 9+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus engineered indifference emerges through the transparent ledger sheets and the lagoon’s uncharted constellation—no moralizing required. The final floating pages recode “freedom” as an act of collective literacy rather than heroic escape, a resonant reconfiguration. Subtext hums in the switchboard’s cautious warmth and the courier’s wordless recognition. The piece avoids tidy takeaway; the city will wake to conflicting texts, leaving the reader to weigh the cost of remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual quirks—puddle reflections as map, brass key as heirloom, ink stink in the truck—creating a distinct syntactic rhythm of clipped observation and lyrical flare when stakes spike. No head-hopping; the courier’s interior is shown only through his raw wrists and brightened gaze, maintaining distance. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, and goal-driven: “Send the weather report” carries double weight without exposition. Voice modulates from weary neighbor tone to compressed urgency under sirens, proving rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the night-time chase without algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is selective—auric lagoon, gold code, door in chest—each image reappears to charge the climax, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances stakes, sensory grounding, or tactic. One near-miss: “starlight braid with the lagoon’s gold” borders on purple, but the next clause snaps back to actionable tracing, preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses revisionist dystopia with obsolete telecom relics—fresh yet inevitable. The puddle-reflection navigation and watermark constellation feel invented yet organic to a city whose history is literally overwritten. Risk is high—lyric density, mosaic beats, conceptual stakes—but coherence never buckles. Transformation is complete: remove the booth key or the lagoon reflection and the entire plot collapses, proving non-swappable ingenuity.</comment>
