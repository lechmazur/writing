<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s quiet hunger to be heard without commodification is embodied through the tactile act of encoding; the micro-choice to sign the wall with the blossom-in-bolt glyph crystallizes his renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—gear-click lullaby, soldered wire loops—avoiding label-speak. The ghost’s need for routing rather than resurrection complicates Lio’s own silence, creating simultaneous impulses. One minor slip: “wanted someone to hear him…” is slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by the bolt-plate spark.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final graffiti glyph reweights the city’s unseen social circuitry, cost legible in Lio’s laugh of acceptance. Causal chain holds—lightning → chip wakes → encode before thunder → glyph signed → readers below feel need spoken back. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“misty courtyard above clouds”). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (encode = routing, not resurrection) and paid off in last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bolt plate’s drilled holes double as musical stave and stamp, constraining the encoding act and charging the final spark-image. Courtyard’s phosphor afterglow and floating lantern roots are filtered through Lio’s tinker-eye, never tourist catalog. Storm-metal scent and wet stones narrow perception to the lightning-thunder window, guiding the urgent timing. Micro-setting supremacy: the plate’s evolving states (press part → charm → stamp → spark-reader) drive the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give the ghost a quiet conduit before thunder erases it—tightens when Lio realizes routing, not resurrection, is required, foreclosing his usual silence. Agency visible: he strikes plate to spark-read his own marks, then signs the wall, paying the cost of perpetual quietude. Pressure coherent under causal lens; coincidence (lightning) complicates, does not resolve. One beat, one meaningful turn, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: unheard needs can only travel if carried by those willing to remain unheard themselves. Subtext resides in the bolt-plate’s transformation from domestic tool to cipher key, and in the ghost’s preference for routing over voice. Final image of city readers feeling needs “spoken back” reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo; silence-as-currency stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: gear-click lullaby, storm-metal scent, solder loops—idiosyncratic tinker diction. Rhythm modulates from long lyrical sentences under lightning hush to staccato sparks at climax. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“time narrow to the space between lightning and thunder”) taught and legible. Under peak stress diction tightens—“He struck the bolt plate against the stone, making sparks”—without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, tool-state, or emotional stake. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no stacked metaphors muddle the lightning beat. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Minor cadence repetition in “he” openings across three adjacent lines mid-story, but rhythm variation elsewhere compensates and closure clarity untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk graffiti steganography powered by orphaned code-ghosts, yet grounded in emotional truth of silent service. Bolt-plate-as-stave is specific, irreplaceable; removing it collapses encoding mechanics and final spark-read. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure. No derivative premise penalty; tinker-balladeer cipher is new angle on “messages in walls.”</comment>
