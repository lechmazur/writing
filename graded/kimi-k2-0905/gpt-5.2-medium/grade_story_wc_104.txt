<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s chained wrist and patient strategy are shown through embodied choices—using the chain as tool, letting a child feel its weight—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts the seed mission, so the arc is steady rather than fracturing. The final grace-note with the farmers lands as earned endurance, cost visible in her trembling wrist, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost fully; a hair more self-interrogation would tip it over.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: wall breach → piano-key cipher → vault access → militia delay → seed escape; each beat happens because of the prior. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—her chain-scarred wrist and the bear’s bulk testify that liberation is heavy. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. One minor ellipsis—how she knows the arrow-marker code—barely grazes credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Redemption center’s grime-coated plush, the sideways piano, and the copper-foil arrow create a tactile micro-setting that directly constrains her path: the piano becomes barricade, the bear becomes smuggler. Smell of “tin and hope” and the cool stairwell air narrow perception to immediacy. Final image—seeds spilling into cracked riverbed—recharges the carnival’s lost prizes with living currency, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“plant resilience”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when engine growl makes every second a choice between saving seed or self. The piano-bench cipher and chain-barricade are visible prices that foreclose retreat. Militia arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves, keeping causality intact under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “freedom is weight” emerges through recurring chain, stuffed bear, and seeds—objects that turn from trash to tomorrow. No character states the moral; the boy’s fingertip on cold iron and the final spill of seed into dry soil reconfigure value without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: city breathes “without permission,” yet Mara still drags metal—grace and burden coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: “dust rises like a curtain” is her metaphor, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens under tension—“engine growl arrives above her like thunder learning its name”—mirroring her controlled haste. No head-hop; the boy’s awe is rendered through her allowance, not his mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short ash-fall beats to longer chained clauses without drumbeat repetition. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield: “hollow note answers her knuckle” does two jobs—sound and confession. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail (copper foil, numbered keys) either advances cipher or barricade. One typo—“benches latch” needs apostrophe—does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-wall seed heist inside a ruined carnival prize booth feels non-obvious; the piano-bench cipher repurposes mundane debris into vault key, transforming trope of hidden resistance cache. Chain-as-tool and bear-as-suitcase are specific, low-tech hacks that could not swap into another tale without collapse. Risk—lyric compression, no dialogue—pays off by letting image carry politics.</comment>
