<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s curiosity and quiet defiance are embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the goggles, decoding the diary, pulling the brake—so her final refusal of the promotion feels earned. The diary’s direct address to her is the only overt shortcut, but it is seeded by earlier “warmly inquisitive fingers” and justified by the captain’s off-stage observation. Interior contradiction is present: she both craves ascent and resents being “merely a carrier,” a tension that sharpens when she stops the lift. Cost is visible: she climbs ten flights by stair, literalizing the extra labor her rebellion demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: because she finds the goggles → deciphers the diary → halts the elevator → foils the lock-out plot. Closure is a Charged Poise: she stands on floor ten wearing the goggles, promotion declined, spire still aloft, new identity crystallized. The diary’s “If you are Lysa” line is a motivated ellipsis—the captain engineered the breadcrumb trail—and the cost (lost ease, gained agency) is legible in her calm stair-climb. Lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass elevator, iced rails, and lantern shimmer are tactile and POV-filtered; the goggles’ refractive trick turns setting into tool, letting light re-write the diary. Spatial choreography is flawless: tray, hatch, brake cable, and footsteps track without drift. Weather is not postcard backdrop—the frozen spire’s “vein” cable is literally yanked to alter plot. Micro-setting (elevator cab) constrains every beat until she steps into the corridor, so environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Lysa remain a passive courier or seize agency? Pressure escalates floor-by-floor as decryption reveals first personal grief, then imminent sabotage. The decisive tightening occurs at floor eight: she must stop the lift and strand herself, trading comfort for authorship of the outcome. Cost is on-page: extra stair climb, social risk, and the quiet forfeiture of the offered promotion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—finding agency by choosing joy inside hardship—emerges through the diary’s cinnamon notes and gull laughter rather than statement. Subtext lives in the goggles: once the captain’s navigation aid, they become Lysa’s lens for rewriting her path. Final image of her adjusting the goggles on her forehead re-weights “ascending” from social climb to self-directed ascent. No moralizing; the resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Lysa’s perceptions; the captain’s voice enters only via diary, avoiding head-hop. Syntax lengthens under decryption pressure—“tilted her head to catch the lamp’s beam”—then shortens when she yanks the brake, mirroring pulse. Diction is precise and period-tinged without pastiche: “wire sealed with a thread,” “sky-maps,” “frozen spine.” No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured, rhythmic narration that remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid cadence to clipped urgency; no template runs or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and integrated: “ladder built out of light” appears once, at peak beat, and justifies itself. Information density is high—tea tray, goggles, wire key, brake vein—yet never stalls momentum. One mixed metaphor risk (“frozen candle” beside “frozen spine”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The encrypted-diary-via-goggles refractive cipher feels fresh, not a recycled steampunk widget. Elevator-as-countdown is a familiar device, but here it is literal infrastructure sabotaged by its own maintenance hatch, turning setting into plot engine. The captain’s posthumous mentorship via engineered curiosity is an inversion of mentor trope that avoids ghostly exposition. Specificity—cinnamon on a mechanic, grit in goggle hinges—lifts the piece above generic ice-spire adventure.</comment>
