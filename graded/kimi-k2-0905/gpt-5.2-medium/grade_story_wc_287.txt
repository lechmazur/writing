<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “wistfully pragmatic” stance is embodied in every micro-choice—climbing down to the harbor, wedging mirrors, tending stripped canes—so the trait is lived, not labeled. The contradiction between tenderness for plants and readiness for covert action creates active tension under pressure. One beat short of 9: we never feel her hesitate or misstep; competence edges out flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: last petal → exposed garden → Jonas’s plea → moonlit lock test → smugglers stopped; each beat tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors now turn the fire escape into a vertical lantern—cost is the rose’s death and her permanent watch; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, skiff, moonlit cages, and the fire-escape micro-setting are filtered through Mara’s gardener-eye: foil shards, stem shadows, salt air on rust. Mirrors-as-tool constrain the final tactic and reappear in the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the unguarded vertical world she’s grown—escalates when smugglers weaponize the same darkness she once softened. One decisive tightening: false bitting pattern forces her to repurpose garden trick into civic defense; price is the rose’s finality and her new sentinel duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultivated vigilance emerges through mirrored light: private nurture retooled for public safety. Final image reweights the earlier “thin green ladder” into a silent alarm system—resonant, unsentimental, morally open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual grammar—plants as bones, moonlight as workable material. Syntax lengthens and softens during rowing, then flares into clipped tool-detail on the pier; rhythm mirrors risk without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “wedge those mirror shards between bolts to angle moonlight across the lock faces” does world, body, and tactic in one breath. Figurative control precise—no mixed metaphors, no filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape gardener turned harbor watch is fresh; mirrors repurposed as civic surveillance tech grows organically from her vocation. Risky vertical choreography and smuggling bitting patterns feel specific, not googled.</comment>
