<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s impulse to sculpt under pressure is vivid and embodied; the lantern-slide handshake with Nora crystallizes her learning drive. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final pocketing of the slide shows earned, costed change. Yet the cross-temporal “alliance” is accepted with almost no interior friction, muting the stakes of her flaw. Still, her craft-as-language motive powers every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the two spirals aligning reweight time itself and leave Mara with a charged, open mandate. Causal chain holds—lantern discovery → spiral instruction → town reads signs → wall saved—each because/therefore link tightens under the Causal lens. One micro-turn (Nora sees Mara’s sculpture) suffices for this length. Cost is visible in the final image: she pockets the fragile slide, accepting perpetual responsibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed arch, rust-and-kelp air, turbine hum, and salt-flecked glass are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s sculptor eye. The lantern’s dry interior inside a soaking arch is a tactile paradox that charges the magic beat. Driftwood pieces (hook, blade, mitten) double as symbol and material constraint, shaping her choices. Environment literally frames the projection surface, so setting constrains tactics and meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent sea-wall failure—surfaces early and tightens through each sculpture planted; townspeople’s trust is the live currency. Escalation is accumulative: each new driftwood sign narrows the path toward cooperative action. Agency stays with Mara; no coincidence resolves the wall risk. Cost is legible in her dawn exhaustion and the silent acceptance of endless repair work ahead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “craft as communal language” emerges wordlessly through the driftwood lexicon; no character sermonizes. The final image of spirals decades apart reconfigures time itself, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Nora’s lifted hand, townspeople touching the spiral—never exposition. Ambiguity remains: alliances form, yet future storms are inevitable, giving the resonance weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual bias—she hears turbines as “reverie,” sees a fishhook as punctuation. Syntax flexes with pressure: long, wave-like sentences during the projection, clipped fragments when she carves. No head-hopping; even Nora’s dialogue is filtered through lantern light. Voice is distinct enough to justify the lyric compression without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain skews sideways” does triple sensory work. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, action, or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—turbine blade as crescent moon—without purple overload. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with sonic echo (“reverie” / “repair”), earning the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The lantern-slide-as-time-thread fuses magic realism with climate-fiction stakes, a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once taught. Driftwood semaphores repurposed as civic code transform a familiar eco-fable into linguistic sculpture. Risk is high—time-collaboration across eras—yet causality never breaks, proving the concept’s integrity. Specific coastal details anchor the fantastical, making the invention memorable rather than ornamental.</comment>
