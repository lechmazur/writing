<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s “stoically sensitive” mask is embodied in the way her tears “stand at attention,” and the crozier’s re-forging externalizes her refusal of the charter; the moment she admits fear to Jun while still handing over the tool shows a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interior contradiction is present but stays a little abstract—“obedience felt like a lid on a boiling flask” is evocative yet not dramatized in a specific prior beat, so the final resolve, while earned, lacks the last ounce of visceral cost on her body or future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: broken crozier → clandestine re-smithing → charter seals burned → new tool and collapsed furnace signal irreversible change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the single-scene arc tightens once through the hammer blows that literally sever Jun’s ledger seals, a visible Decisive Change with cost (the furnace vitrifies, foreclosing reuse). The lens holds without ambiguity; only a whisper of outline-like sequencing in the middle beats keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ember nexus is not postcard scenery: frost-crusted slag dunes breathe through cracked basalt and literally exhale approval when the charter burns, a micro-setting that constrains the final act. Saffron-iron air and the furnace pit’s glow guide every filing and hammer strike; the crozier’s evolving temperature is tracked as a second “body” in the scene. Spatial choreography stays exact—no impossible distances—so the environment earns closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interrupt destiny before it seals—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through each controlled fracture; the charter’s wax hiss is the audible cost. One meaningful tightening suffices: the crozier’s re-shape forces Jun’s ledger (and thus the quota system) to be literally cut away. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence is absent; the price (loss of furnace, bishop’s authority, and legal seals) is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Creative destruction emerges from action, not sermon: the crozier’s spiral is not restored but re-curved “to catch light rather than command,” a concrete image that reweights authority as guidance. The final glassy collapse of the furnace offers a non-literal answer—rules vitrify into harmless glass—without moralizing. Subtext in Jun’s hesitation and Mara’s steady fear keeps the theme from tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—“air tasted of iron, saffron, and old prayers” is alchemist-specific synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for filing, staccato hammer beats under stress. No head-hopping; Jun’s interior is implied only through gesture and dialogue indirection. Voice is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances tool-state while echoing emotional heat. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor vehicles (banked coals, frozen bloom) stay coherent. One clause—“successive approximation, a measure, a note, a correction, and then the next measure”—risks minor scaffolding but serves as pattern-teaching for the iterative smithing and is paid off. Closure image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemist who literally un-forges a bishop’s crozier to burn the charter that bound her offers a fresh angle on rebellion; the transformation of ecclesiastical rod into molten stream-guide feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in collapsing the furnace into glass pays off thematically and visually. Only the apprentice’s late entrance skirts archetype, slightly softening the overall freshness.</comment>
