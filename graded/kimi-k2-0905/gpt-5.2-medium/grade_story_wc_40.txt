<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scholar’s reticence is shown through marginal voice and pocketed crystal, but the interior contradiction—desire to decode vs. fear of blame—stays summary; the final plea is credible yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied, so the arc lands slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s echo turns the Council’s gaze toward the hidden door at dawn, reweighting the hush from curse to cradle; causality holds under Accumulative lens—each shard of testimony layers pattern until the final image crystallizes choice with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library-as-greenhouse, chandelier crystal, and paper-skin corridor are tactile, specific, and constrain every move; micro-setting (crystal held, door outlined in stems) directly enables the mapping beat and charges the final echo, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect or expose the root lexicon—tightens when the corridor reveals apprentices composting words; the hush escalates from menace to invitation, forcing the narrator’s public stance with visible social risk, though the cost is more communal than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of language’s necessary decay and rebirth emerges through vine-translation and composting pages; the final image of the echo-lit door offers a non-literal, charged answer without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reticent-scholar diction—“margins,” “suspended hush,” “root lexicon”—remains consistent; syntactic rhythm mirrors caution, then widens into wonder; no head-hopping, stable first-person past, and perceptual signature is sharply maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “night like ink,” “paper skins shedding silently” do double duty; one paraphrase loop (“suspended hush” repeated without new pressure) and a single mixed metaphor (“weathered innocence”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The post-dictionary greenhouse library, sonically reflective crystal mapping vine-code, and composting lexicon synthesize fresh mythic logic; the risk of linguistic eco-horror pays off in a reconfiguration that feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
