<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lysa’s interiority is concrete—she tests the arrow tip on seedlings, chooses to fly by water instead of horizon, and presses the shard into the stone tree at cost. The contradiction between seeking a miracle source and accepting communal resilience is dramatized in the final gesture, not declared. No secondary character on page, so status crucible N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy (seed rights vs. healing hope) is visible and drives the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arrow tip’s origin revealed as weapon-turned-graft reweights “resilience” from singular miracle to collective chorus. Causal lens holds: arrow warmth → canyon → stone tree → renunciation. Orientation anchored by word 40 (Pomona Drift, orchard terraces, gravity inversion schedule). No teleporting props; the shard’s travel is tracked throughout. Cost is felt—“she pried the broken arrow tip free… accepting that resilience was not hidden in one miracle source.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, inverted irrigation ribbons, and the whirling silence are filtered through pilot attention; water flow replaces horizon as navigational tool, constraining her final approach. Micro-setting (skiff cockpit, hovering slab) is tactile and guides the landing choice. Sensory hierarchy favors motion and sound over visual catalog. Final image—water returning downward—recharges the opening motif and reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the secret of resilience—tightens when the arrow’s warmth tugs her into the hollow; option to keep the talisman is foreclosed by pressing it into the communal tree. Escalation is causal: each beat (test seedlings, follow water, enter ring) narrows possibility. Visible price: she relinquishes the healing shard, accepting shared stewardship. No coincidence resolves; gravity inversion is scheduled, not random.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of weapon into graft: resilience is a collective scar, not a private cure. Subtext resides in the silent heartbeat chorus under the arches—past pilots’ choices now guide her. Final image reweights the arrow from treasure to contribution without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: orchard still faces drought, but stance has shifted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual filter—water flow, engine hum, arrow warmth. Syntax stretches and compresses with gravity inversion: long clauses while floating, short beats at touchdown. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Diction remains within pilot lexicon; no corporate register drift. Psychic distance narrows in the hollow until only heartbeat and drip remain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “irrigation ribbons unspooled upward” does image + world rule in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent—arches as “glass ladders,” silence as “whirling.” One clause drifts toward elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) but recovers immediately. Final line lands with cadence match to opening water motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Weapon-to-graft inversion feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior orchard planet story fuses anti-grav inversion with ballistic arboriculture. Specificity of “firing metal seeds into trunks so the trees would heal faster” transforms familiar trope of healing artifact into communal practice. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off when echo chamber reweights meaning. Removing any singular detail—water navigation, arrow tip, stone tree—collapses the arc.</comment>
