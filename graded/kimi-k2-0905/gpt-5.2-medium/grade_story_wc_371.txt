<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mina’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is dramatized through concrete sensory choices—wrapping the loaf, tracking bricked doors, kneeling to plant wheat—so interior contradiction and embodied emotion stay on the page. The confession of signing the complaint gives credible moral texture and drives her later guerrilla act, earning the quiet absolution. Micro-choices (breaking the relic loaf, dipping it in tea) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Voice stays individual; no stock therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sprout in frozen mortar reweights all prior erasures with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—invitation → courtyard → confession → planting—each step narrowing options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (vanished bakery, bricked door) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (faint sweetness of stale crust, lantern tremble in fig trees) anchors mood without catalog bloat. The cracked fountain bowl and wheat seeds in mortar function as micro-setting that directly constrains the final planting choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the courtyard moves. Weather and season (after birds, tightening winter) affect timing and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve ordinary sacredness before erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: from passive noticing to active planting that risks patrol reprisal. The confession beat deepens cost, turning private guilt into public vulnerability. No coincidence resolves; the sprout emerges from prior seed choice. Price is visible: exposure in a now-dark courtyard with footsteps outside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-edible and mercy-as-cultivation emerges through loaf, tea, and seeds without sermon. Final image reconfigures “absolution” as ongoing repair rather than clean pardon. Subtext in Sada’s heuristically gentle speech carries unspoken risk. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance arises from thyme in dry fountain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Mina’s perceptual signature—smoke complaint regret, crust sweetness, mortar sprout. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “So Mina knelt” as pressure spikes. No head-hopping; Sada’s interior remains opaque. Dialogue indirection (“drink first, then speak”) advances plot with subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“lantern light trembling among fig trees” sets tone without density overload. Strong verbs (tucked, bricked, scraped) replace modifiers. Opening and final lines anchor voice and reweight stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening as slow-motion resistance against bureaucratic erasure feels fresh and specific; wheat in palace cracks is not a trope retread. Relic loaf fused with absolution ritual creates novel sacramental image. Transformation test fails if swapped: sprout must be wheat seeded by Mina. Risk in quiet ending pays off through charged poise.</comment>
