<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Riven’s dry editorial wit surfaces in the Ministry “joke” and the “single throat” line, but the interior contradiction never hardens into a decisive on-page choice—he traces the droplet, listens, and the cost is only projected (“maps are weapons”). The phrasebook-as-inheritance adds texture yet doesn’t force a micro-choice under pressure; Lysa’s calm functions more as scenic foil than crucible. Earned stasis is credible, but the absence of an irreversible action keeps the arc just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: condensation pattern, vellum one-word reveal, and spring image layer until the stake reweights. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 4), the single transition (outpost → hollow) is legible, and the closure beat—“the spring answered by beginning again and again”—delivers a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: the blank space is alive, the Ministry will weaponize it. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (radio dead, glass cracked) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, cracked pane, and black-stone field are filtered through Riven’s cartographer gaze; every sensory pick (fogged glass, warm mist) doubles as survey data. The window crack literally becomes the ridge-line template—setting constrains the final mapping act, charging the closure image. Selective detail keeps momentum; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cartographic truth vs. state control—lands early and tightens once: the condensation droplet collapses three rivers to one origin, foreclosing the “rounding error” lie. Pressure accumulates through environmental markers (dead radio, lake silence) rather than causal reversals; the protagonist’s agency is attention and tracing, not confrontation, but the cost is legible—he now carries knowledge that will be weaponized. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via hydrology metaphor: truth, like water, seeks a single throat yet endlessly re-begins. The final image of the spring “beginning again and again” reweights the phrasebook’s shelter motif—language cannot dam the source. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether publication equals complicity. Particulars (trader script, dog-ear) keep the abstraction grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a crisp, sardonic cadence—“a joke on both counts,” “dry wit for armor”—that modulates into quieter awe at the spring. Diction stays within an editor’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. The one-line dialogue (“Converge”) is purposeful compression, not spoken prose. Psychic distance tightens effectively from reflective to immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer (“quiet verdict,” “single throat”) is sparse and patterned, never obscuring causality. High information density: each clause advances stakes, setting, or metaphor. One minor scaffold—two adjacent “beginning again” phrases—reads as intentional echo rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “blank map space” trope is refreshed through singular convergence hydrology and a bureaucrat-editor POV; the Ministry-as-antagonist stays off-stage, avoiding cliché. Specific maternal phrasebook and Slate the falcon particularize the premise. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than twist—but execution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
