<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lian’s shift from passive predictor to active arranger is embodied in the micro-choice of pushing the courier into the cleft; the contradiction between prophecy and agency is kept alive in scene, not explained. Interiority stays concrete—ink smell, salt burn, beam rhythm—never sliding into label-speak. The final renunciation of coded fortunes costs her the safety of anonymity; the price is legible in the blank paper she burns. Voice remains singular, no head-hop, and status with Mara is legible in gesture, not exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because her earlier cookies reached wrong hands, the patrol comes; therefore she redirects the beam and burns the archive. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (Golden Lotus, midnight ferry) and waiver applies since disorientation (no west steps) pays off at climax. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses her prophet role, cost shown in “blank paper…salt smell,” reconfiguring her future options. No teleporting props; microdot specs, lens shutters, and courier skiff all track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam is not backdrop but tool: its blink pattern physically enables/negates escape, charging the final image. Kelp-covered skiff, worn rock cleft, and Fresnel shutters are tactile, lived-in, and constrain exit routes. Weather is causal—storm arrives as predicted, narrowing the timeline. Micro-setting (fortune strips) doubles as data-storage object, re-weighted when burned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of information flow—tightens when patrol boat follows the very beam she once used for smuggling. One meaningful turn: she swings the light inland, sacrificing her own channel to save the courier. Cost is immediate: loss of her fortune archive and exposure to patrol. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as currency vs. silence as autonomy—emerges through the burning of blank paper, not exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: pushing the courier into shadow speaks louder than any manifesto. Final line reweights “new key” musically: silence now carries notation, a conceptual repricing. No moralizing; ambiguity remains about whether she is free or merely muted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tight: Lian notices light bounce off cookie glass, ink smell on stainless steel—details only a fortune writer would weigh. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under beam-switching pressure. No head-hop; Mara’s dialogue is spare, distinct from Lian’s interior lyric. Register stays within plausible lexicon for a bilingual kitchen worker turned cryptographer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: long sentences while baking, staccato while shutters click. No synonym loops; “beam,” “flash,” “strip” retain precise referents. Metaphors are spare—“lighthouse like a single white tooth”—and never layered to clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, character beat, and causal link.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing fortune-cookie prophecy with microdot espionage feels inevitable here, not gimmicky; the sweetness-as-camouflage concept commits fully. The “west steps” twist—an unmarked cleft—reverses expectation without breaking prior geography. Risk taken in quiet ending (blank paper, salt smell) pays off by reweighting silence as agency. Transformation test fails if cookie writer or lighthouse removed; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>
