<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—her fear and wonder are embodied in the lantern tremor and ankle-deep stance—but the causal chain from “inspired by silence” to risking a night alone in a drowned theater is asserted rather than dramatized; the moment she bows to an empty room lands as ritual gesture, not visible cost, so the final endurance feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s spatial score redefines “performance” and the dawn rehearsal enacts it with felt cost—musicians dispersed into ruin, music traveling through seams. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each water-bloom map is a pattern break that reweights the stake; the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. One minor slack: the stagehand’s whisper is off-stage exposition, but it is repaid when the first drop blots ink into a map, so the break is negligible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flooded pit, warped doors, and lantern shimmer are tactile constraints that guide every move; water depth dictates silence instead of bowing, and the final lantern placement is charged by the earlier “false applause” reflection—environment directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the house’s voice—tightens through each water-stain revelation; the missing beats in the score foreclose a normal concert, forcing Lena into ruin-crawlspaces. Cost is visible: she forfeits safety, soaks the program, and accepts a score that can only exist in gaps. One escalation only, but it is decisive and on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—art must inhabit rupture, not resist it—emerges from the water-bloated staff lines and the final dispersal of players into broken corridors; no moral is stated, yet the closing “answering Varga” reweights every prior silence as compositional material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches Lena’s hush-obsessed ear; syntax lengthens and shortens with breath-like cadence, and perceptual filters (trembling flame = nervous bow stroke) stay violinist-specific. No head-hop or register drift; the single POV is stable and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—one sentence often carries image, motion, and metaphor—but occasional stacked qualifiers (“shallow pool under the stage… broken panels… in between space”) slightly dilute immediacy in the inciting beat; no loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure, so momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera house as spatial score is fresh; the ghost’s water-activated notation transforms mundane water damage into compositional instruction. Risk—wordless tap-code dialogue—pays off by making silence a performative act, not a gimmick. Specificity of violin-tap echoing pipe drips anchors the concept in lived craft.</comment>
