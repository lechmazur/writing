<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s quietly rebellious drum-tapping turns consent into covert agency; the shared-dream motive is embodied, not labeled. Interior contradiction pulses when the drug forces empathy with Sato, yet the beat keeps hijacking the protocol for the brother. The final choice—to return alone and drum the gate open—pays the cost of permanent outsider status, earned by every prior tap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: each drum strike tightens neural entanglement → Sato’s grief surfaces → institute alarms → they cut the feed → narrator walks out with data yet chooses nightly return, a decisive change that forecloses innocence. Closure image (solo perch, breathing the dream) carries felt cost: eternal vigil instead of resurrection. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sound-wave garden, conductive lagoon, and drumming body form a single instrument that constrains every tactic: only tap-frequency can steer the hallucination. Gold algae glow and reed resonance are filtered through the POV’s percussive bias, never touristic. The final solo night-return recharges the same gate, bench, and water as sacred relics now outside institutional ownership.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the narrator smuggle his brother back via harmony—tightens when empathy with Sato threatens to dilute the dream into mere compassion. Mid-scene reversal: drumming hijacks the protocol, forcing both adults to witness the children together; option to flee is foreclosed by alarms, cost is shared neural burn and lifelong guardianship of an unsanctioned memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as communal instrument, not property—emerges through drum/echo imagery rather than assertion. Final image of solitary breathing beside dark water reweights earlier “auric sorrow” into quiet custodianship, a conceptual repricing that denies both scientific capture and religious resurrection. No moralizing; the cost is the eternal vigil itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains percussive diction—“knuckles striking basalt,” “lagoon answered in rings”—that mirrors the narrator’s covert agenda. No head-hopping; Sato’s grief arrives only through shared sensation, keeping focalization clean. Compression (“cold fire spread”) and rhythmic fragments under alarm pressure stay legible because the drum pattern was taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long liquid rolls to abrupt taps, mimicking musical phrasing without falling into template cadence. Figurative layering—“auroral sorrow,” “constellation of gestures”—is selective, never stalls momentum, and pays off in final afterimage. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns stable through entanglement sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Neural-harmonic memory transfer is familiar sci-fi, yet the percussion-as-hacking interface and mutual child-echo garden feel freshly synthesized. Risk: turning empathy tech into a duet of bereaved siblings and parent; the payoff justifies the gamble. Without the drum-specific mechanic the entire emotional engine collapses, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
