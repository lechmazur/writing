<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—blaming the father while the compass points inward—grounds the arc; the single twig-pruning act crystallizes renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (salt wind rifling hair, cold coin) stays specific. Silence-as-flaw is credibly maintained until the self-indictment on the deck. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; Sera functions as oracle, not crucible, keeping score just below 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle flips from external quest to internal severance, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost (“the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lace pattern, tide cadence, and color gradient tighten once toward the sea-glass hue. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within 50 words; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the compass that will keep pulling memory—shapes tactics and final image, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kelp-basalt scent, rain-pearled cedar, and salt-stung deck are filtered through grief-biased attention, not tourist catalog. The cracked bonsai pot on a ghost ship’s deck acts as micro-setting that constrains the final pruning choice. Spatial choreography remains clean from lagoon path to ladder to deck. Weather (rain-washed cerulean) evolves with emotional gradient, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the color of unspoken apologies—signals early. Pressure tightens once when the compass swings toward the Wanderer, foreclosing the option to keep blaming the father. The pruning act pays the visible price (anger diffused, sea-glass hue). Under Accumulative lens, the lace-to-bonsai transfer reweights the stake without needing multiple reversals; cost is legible, holding high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: remorse as iterative craft—knot, window, border—rather than thesis. The final cerulean is neither absolution nor accusation but the first tint of self-apology, leaving plausible counter-readings. Subtext operates in compass silence and creaking rigging; no final-paragraph moralizing. Image of pruning a single salt-green needle reconfigures prior grief, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: tidal metaphors, lace syntax, and salt-stung diction reflect a mind trying to unknot guilt. No dialogue; therefore dialogue bullets waived. Psychic distance tightens credibly during the deck-board epiphany. Patterned elision (pauses long enough for the sea to breathe) is taught early and paid off at closure, keeping within 9 range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to the clipped “I pruned one brittle twig,” mirroring diffusion of anger. Figurative layering (compass as coin, regret as tide) stays coherent; no mixed metaphors at climax. Information density high: one sentence often carries scent, memory cue, and action. One paraphrase loop (“slow-spoken and unwavering” echoed twice) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai pruning, antique lace cryptography, and ghost-ship compass feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; removal of any pillar collapses the arc. Risky lyric compression is taught early and holds to final hue. Specific detail (rain pearls on cedar, salt-green needle) prevents abstraction. Synthesis of memory-tide craft with color-as-apology offers fresh inflection, meriting bonus.</comment>
