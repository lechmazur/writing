<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—her “blood mixed with rainwater” and the mirror-eye equivalence show contradiction under pressure. The guardian’s silence is a credible stance, not a void, and his micro-choices (tilting mirror, shutter code) alter her options. Her confession is earned: the mirror descent makes her prior complicity undeniable. Cost is visible—she bites through lip, speaks through pain—meeting the 9+ test, but the guardian’s spiral-calm trait stays more label than lived limit, capping just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the patrol boat’s arrival is the Decisive Change, but the emotional cost is the mirror-star now fixed in her eye—she can never unread the face. Causality holds: each shutter adjustment tightens the lattice that summons the watchman, so her confession is the only remaining path. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“cobalt dock”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Lens is Causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dock, shutters, and mirror function as micro-setting: the shutter weave physically constrains how starlight reaches the water, directly shaping the help signal. Petrol film, bruised-coin boards, and “crooked hinges” are tactile and POV-filtered. Weather remains causal—wet boards refract the lattice, enabling the discovery. Environment is not backdrop; it is the tool that makes the final image possible, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt versus exposure—signals early via “half-spoken secret.” Escalation is single, meaningful: the guardian’s shutter-net forces the girl from silence to speech by making the corpse visible. Agency is hers; she lowers the mirror, chooses confession when the star-lantern leaves no moral wiggle room. Cost is legible—her blood, the fixed star in her eye—meeting the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: complicity becomes accountability when darkness is taught to “read” starlight. No explicit thesis; the mirror’s final frame—her eye beside the star—reweights prior complicity without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: guardian’s finger to lips transfers spiral-calm into her breathing, showing silence as ethical space rather than cowardice. Final image offers conceptual repricing: the canal now holds a star that will not vanish with the body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the girl’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction—“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension”—is patterned early and paid off in her steadied breath. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences build lattice, then short beats (“she bit her lip until blood”) punch climax. Guardian’s silence is rendered through observed detail, not ventriloquized interiority, keeping distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are coherent—“ribs like a staircase,” “water learning to read a sky”—and physically tied to shutter angles. No filter-verb stacks; actions are verb-driven (“tilted,” “widening,” “wove”). Line-level craft peaks at closure: “darkness there began to shimmer, not banished but persuaded”—compressed, muscular, luminous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses noir canal, star-code shutter loom, and dental mirror—synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The “teach darkness the value of stars” conceit reconfigures guilt into astronomical accountability, a fresh moral geometry. Risk: turning shutters into semaphore could read twee, yet mechanics are grounded in carpentry and optics, earning suspension of disbelief. Specificity of dock-code (“three bright bars and a gap”) prevents abstract allegory, locking novelty to place.</comment>
