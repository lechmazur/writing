<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronicler’s lucid-dream agency is concrete and stakes her body—tears dried to salt, voice given to Nera—so the interior contradiction is felt. The promise to “carry part of it in my pages” is a micro-choice that later costs her when she must speak the dead brother’s fear aloud. Only the brother’s trembling-hand cameo edges toward convenient pathos; the rest is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decoded rite reframes the temple from treasure to grief-vault, and the cost is the chronicler’s permanent obligation to return and witness. Causal chain holds—telegram → star-timing dream → shared rite—each because/therefore link narrows options until the final cooled exhale. No teleporting props; the daylily telegram reappears beside the charts to cue the dream.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass instruments and rotating maps are handled, not listed; the broken temple roof lets starlight physically strike the fresh plaster, charging the final image. Salt-crusted tears on the chronicler’s cheeks tether body to flats; the dream courtyard’s pulsing lintels act as micro-setting that constrains how syllables can be spoken. Environment is never backdrop—it enables the decoding act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode before wind erases—tightens when Nera’s grief becomes the secondary pressure that demands the chronicler risk her dream-body inside the temple. One meaningful escalation: the dream reveals the vault’s true purpose, foreclosing any scholarly “victory” and replacing it with lifelong witness; the cooled sanctuary air is the visceral price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the syllable-bridge premise: grief is not solved but spoken and halved. The final image of footprints keeping each other from vanishing reweights the opening obsession with catalogued stars—catalogs now serve relationship, not conquest. No moralizing; the insight stays inside the chronicler’s salt-crusted skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise perceptual signature: astronomical diction (“variable stars pulsed like slow breathing”) collides with botanical tenderness (“daylily-pressed telegram”). Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses when the brother’s hand trembles, then elongates during the communal reading. No head-hopping; dream logic is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “I recorded everything, in ink and in dream, because chronicles are also vessels” advances both action and theme without flab. One mixed-metaphor risk—“ship stalled in black water” beside desert salt—passes because the chronicler’s own tears later literalize the salt. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream archaeologist who must heal through witness rather than decipherment feels novel, yet the emotional engine—shared grief—is timeless. Specificity anchors freshness: star-timing carved into trembling hand, plaster mixed under new moon. Risky lyric compression is taught early and rewarded at closure, so the concept commits without gimmick.</comment>
