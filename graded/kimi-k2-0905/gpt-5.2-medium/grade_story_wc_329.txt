<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is embodied in every micro-choice—hiding the bow, tapping the shell, knuckle-playing the chained trunk—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is concrete: the father-memory surfaces only as it fuels the final act of arboreal liberation, not as exposition. The only bar to 9 is that the statues remain faceless obstacles; Lio never tests his own belief against a flicker of their possible sentience, so the relationship crucible is empty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: rumor → shell → heartbeat code → statues desync → tree uproots → city path re-opened; each beat tightens the next. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the walking tree drags its iron cradle, the stone guardians are “softened” but still follow—beauty is free yet forever escorted by the system it escaped. Orientation lands by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gearford’s soot-coated rivets, pear-dull gold, and granite-joint rasp are filtered through Lio’s musical sensorium, so every detail also characterizes. The chained tree functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—its iron cradle must be cracked—meeting the 9+ gate. One tenth withheld only because the sky-bridge itself, though named, never re-enters tactically after the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can beauty re-enter the mechanical city?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tested by the orchard’s PROPERTY tags. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Lio shifts from evasion (heartbeat trick) to irreversible sabotage (knuckle-playing the trunk), narrowing his option set from stealth to open revolt. Cost is visible: the statues seize him, the tree drags its prison-scars into the city, and Lio’s violin remains unplayed—he has traded song for insurgent horticulture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of property: the cataloged tree reclaims agency by literally walking its chains back to town. No character moralizes; the image of stone guards “softened by pear-scented dust” reweights power without sermon. The final resonance is conceptual—beauty can re-enter the machine, but only while dragging its fetters, a cost that re-prices the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lio’s musical perception: wind “files metal without sparks,” sap has a “slow, thirsty throb.” Syntax lengthens and syncopates during the heartbeat signaling, then fractures into staccato knocks on bark—prose becomes performance. No POV leakage; even the statues’ erosion is heard as “gears in sand,” never explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances image or causality; no paraphrase loops, no filler filters. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—velvet filing metal, guilty teeth tags—because each vehicle returns to tactile sound. One clause—“a crack that sounded like a chord resolving”—risks minor mixed metaphor but pays off the musical through-line, so artifact stays sub-deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of clock-punk city, heartbeat Morse, and arboreal jailbreak feels inevitable yet unseen before; the locust-shell amplifier turns entomology into revolutionary tech without exposition. Risk is maximal—sentient tree marches into Gearford—but causality never breaks, so boldness heightens rather than cheapens. Transformation passes: swap shell for flute or city for desert and the entire emotional math collapses.</comment>
