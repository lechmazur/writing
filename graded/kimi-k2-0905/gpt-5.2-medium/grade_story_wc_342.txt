<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s face-blindness is more than label: it dictates how she reads the coin, paints the sky, and accepts her limit in the final line. The interior contradiction—wanting to preserve yet forced to relinquish—plays out in micro-choices (painting faster, sliding the book back). Cost is visible: she forfeits the book and the tree. Missing 0.3 because the foreman beat is too polite to test her hierarchy of values under real threat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the painted sky stays, the real tree falls, the coin re-locks the safe—cost legible in “accepting the limit of time.” Causal chain (coin → safe → book → painted vault) holds without gaps. Lens is Causal: every beat narrows options because demolition is one minute closer. One hairline slip: the “five more minutes” request is granted too easily, softening the final pressure tick.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is lived-in body-tool-environment: the heartwood panel “smooth as a closed eyelid” constrains the coin fit; ladder rungs dictate where she can paint; demolition cough outside is the ticking clock. Tree-library rules are learned through action, never dumped. The painted sky at the end reconfigures the space from chapel to vault, charging the final image. Micro-setting (coin rim, safe depression) directly enables the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the book and mirror the sky—tightens when time shrinks from “hush” to “first hammer struck.” One meaningful turn: she chooses to seal the book back inside, trading preservation-by-possession for preservation-by-art. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the physical archive. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes during the foreman beat, keeping this just outside the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—limits as creative necessity—emerges through fractal recursion: the coin’s micro-grooves → star maps → her own perceptual limit. No moralizing; the final image of “painted constellations” reweights the premise: knowledge can survive in pattern, not only in matter. Subtext in the foreman’s silent nod implies art’s authority over demolition. Slight reserve because the guild’s centuries of data remain abstract, lessening conceptual bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, synaesthetic, precise: “dust settle on her sleeves,” “galaxies implied in flecks of ash.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fractures into staccato requests under deadline—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. Perceptual signature is bias toward texture, sound, posture; face-blindness is never named, only enacted. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within Liora’s artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “ladders and shelves spiraled upward like ribs” does double sensory work. Metaphors are coherent—valleys/rivers on the coin become star charts—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “fractally precise” is repeated conceptually though wording shifts. Final third avoids figurative overload, keeping closure image crystalline. Minor paraphrase in “heightened stillness of a chapel that had forgotten its prayers” could trim one clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses face-blind portraitist + recursive coin-code + arboreal archive—synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Fractal pattern as mnemonic for constellations reconfigures a standard save-the-library plot into an elegy about replication versus possession. Risk: withholding the book’s contents could feel coy, but the choice to re-seal it flips expectation. Fresh inflection: her defect becomes the exact tool required, turning limitation into method.</comment>
