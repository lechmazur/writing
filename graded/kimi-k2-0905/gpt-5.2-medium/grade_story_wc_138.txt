<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ilias’s boredom-as-cowardice crystallizes late and powers the final surrender; the amulet’s pull on his “dimensional awareness” gives one concrete micro-choice that costs his immortality. Interiority stays specific—lightning bores him, curiosity is “manufactured”—but the beat where he “finally meant the word” is slightly abstract; a sharper embodied cue would clinch 9+. Maris’s guarded fatigue is sketched in two refracted images that efficiently force his decision. Overall, a strong arc of immortal avoidance → earned self-erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the completed amulet rewrites him into “what remains,” stripping immortality with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—storm → mutiny → amulet map → self-offering—though the midpoint “corridors demand a leader” is asserted more than dramatized. Orientation is swift: immortal, prismatic refuge, storm, within 120 words. One transition (corridor tilt → heart chamber) is legible; mosaic pattern not needed. Lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prismatic glass that “shifts as if trying to remember another spectrum” doubles as external terrain and psychic mirror; the hexagon of spinning prisms literally votes on his fate, so environment constrains the final choice. Sensory triage favors magnetics, ozone, salt-veined metal—selective, urgent. Spatial choreography is clean even during 90° tilts. The field of suspended farewells could use one more tactile anchor, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the only path becomes self-goodbye with immortality forfeit. One meaningful escalation: corridors mutate from spatial nuisance to dimensional rebellion demanding a sovereign sacrifice. Cost is visible: “his immortality peeling away like a coat in rain.” No reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word scope. Pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through images of severance and spectral reassembly rather than thesis statements; the final image reweights every prior goodbye he ever shrugged off. Subtext in Maris’s refracted reflections lets the reader deduce her own amulet scarring without exposition. The insight—“space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains”—is earned by the physical walk into the suspended field. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors magnetic geometry and prismatic refraction, never ventriloquizing Maris. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses during corridor mutiny, longer cadence in the farewell field. No dialogue clutter; the single spoken warning carries subtext of shared guilt. Voice stays consistent while registering the micro-shift from ennui to reverence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “colors...trying to remember another spectrum” advances both physics and mood. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-stress beats. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly through spatial contortions. One mixed moment—“pressure change between angles”—is minor; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing solar-storm magnetics with a grief-powered architecture mutiny feels fresh; the “farewell archive” as dimensional dumping ground reframes familiar after-life tropes. Risky structure—corridors literally sliding through themselves—pays off by forcing the protagonist to author the exit he always evaded. Specificity of salt-veined dark metal and prismatic council keeps the concept grounded. Synthesis seems inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
