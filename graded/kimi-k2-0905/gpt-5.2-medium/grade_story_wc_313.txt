<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory duties—expunge versus humanize—are dramatized in the photograph trail and the final public confession; the boot-print moment crystallizes her shift from complicity to accountability with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak, and the wind-chime silence embodies the repressed memory she must either keep sleeping or let sing. The choice to display her father’s redacted report beside the sapphire label is a micro-choice that reorders her hierarchy of values and forecloses the family lie forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: silent chime → exposed street → label → photograph trail → recovered memory → public reckoning; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the town’s “audit” can no longer be dammed by paperwork, and Mara forfeits her inherited authority. The lens stays causal throughout; no information appears without prior trigger or later consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reservoir-as-mirror, ridgeway guardrail corkboard, and the bar’s mud-preserved boot print are tactile anchors that constrain movement and memory. The sapphire label’s return on the counter reconfigures the space from relic to evidence. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of absent water, visual echo of rooflines—keeps atmosphere lean yet immersive, never halting momentum for tourist-catalog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—surfaces with the first silent chime and escalates as each photograph shrinks Mara’s room to maneuver. The reversal occurs when she chooses to photograph the boot print instead of bulldozing it, paying the social cost of exposing her father’s crime. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence rescues her from the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposition of drowned town and buried report: erasure is itself a flood that eventually recedes. The final display in the library reweights “shared meaning” as communal accountability rather than curated myth, achieving resonance without moralizing. Silence-turned-chime operates as Conceptual Repricing: the same absence now indicts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a restrained hydro-engineer precision—“seep meters where sky and water trade colors”—that cracks only once, at “Listen, Mara,” letting the child’s vernacular surface. Patterned elision (no direct dialogue) is taught early and paid off when the chime’s return sings in place of spoken apology. Perceptual signature remains consistent: bureaucrat eyes that notice flood marks and boot prints before emotions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short telemetry—“the lake had dropped again”—to lyric cadence that mirrors water movement, avoiding algorithmic rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “rooflines rising from mud as if waking” condenses resurrection and accusation in one stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combines drowned-town ghost story with bureaucratic whistle-blower arc in a way that feels inevitable, not stitched. The photograph-trail method literalizes memory archaeology, turning a trope into procedural engine. Risk lies in quiet ending—no dam breach, only exhibit—but the conceptual repricing of silence-as-evidence makes the freshness undeniable.</comment>
