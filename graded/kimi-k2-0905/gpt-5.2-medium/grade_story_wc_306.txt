<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—selling certainty while hoarding doubt—remains vivid and embodied; the moment she drapes the cloak over herself instead of delivering it, her micro-choice visibly reorders her hierarchy of values. The paid-conscience premise could feel schematic, yet her flinch from the eyeless mirror keeps the flaw alive under pressure. Cost is legible: she leaves carrying the weight she was paid to remove, a renunciation that closes the causal arc. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cloak’s transfer to Mara reweights the premise—doubt becomes portable property, not commodity. Causal chain holds: because she accepts the chime warning, therefore she dons the cloak, therefore Sile’s tower must bend. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“lighthouse at dawn”) and never breaks. One tightening beat—the mirror showing her eyeless face—pays off in the final ash-strewn image where the shard is abandoned, its hollow reflection now shared cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Salt-oil stair scent and wind-chime code turn the lighthouse into a tactile tool that constrains entry and choice; the chimes’ audible triad literally gates Mara’s next move. Dawn light drinking into the gray cloak threads supplies a final image that recharges earlier sensory cues. Spatial choreography is clean: shard-to-chime proximity effect is tracked without drift. Environment never slides into postcard; every detail either resists or enables the act of unhooking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Mara will deliver or absorb doubt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: when the cloak’s fabric “slides over her hands like cool smoke” she forfeits the paid outcome. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price (she keeps the burden) is visible and alters her trajectory off-page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no escalation loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: doubt as professional commodity versus lived weight. The mirror’s eyeless reflection and the ash-buried shard reconfigure the abstract idea into concrete, irreversible loss. Final image—Mara walking off wearing the client’s fear—invites reflection on whether conscience can be leased, yet offers no moral slogan. Ambiguity is charged, not confusing; the reweighting feels inevitable once the cloak touches her skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: chimes translated, mirror flinched from, cloak smelled of salt and oil. Syntax lengthens under emotional load—“she could have walked back down and sold Sile the same easy story”—then fractures into shorter units at the shard reveal, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; Sile’s reaction is read through gesture and shoulder shift only. Voice maintains lyric compression without purple drift; every metaphor is tethered to sensory ground.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, motive, forward motion—without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“certainty… certainty” within adjacent clauses) but it occurs pre-escalation and does not touch closure. Strong verbs dominate: “flinched,” “unhook,” “widened.” Figurative language is sparse, precise: cloak like “cool smoke” is the single extended image and it lands. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” could be gimmick; here it’s weaponized into a fresh ethical engine—selling doubt while secretly stockpiling it. Wind-chime cryptography turns an overused lighthouse into an interactive lock. The cloak of doubt as transferable fabric that literally bends a stone tower of certainties synthesizes metaphor and plot into one irreversible gesture. Risk is taken and paid off: the protagonist fails her commission yet fulfills her conscience, a reversal that feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
