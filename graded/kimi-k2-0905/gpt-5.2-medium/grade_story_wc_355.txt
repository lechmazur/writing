<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lio’s pacifist refusal to force the diary open is embodied, costly, and drives every beat; the moment he bows to the clasp crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—“paper-dry scent of smoke and lavender” anchors empathy in sensory specificity, not label-speak. The final micro-choice—swapping the unstable shells—pays off the earlier quarrel with Mara and visibly forecloses blame, earning the quiet closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: resonator pitch → clasp yields → diary intel → shell swap → crowd safety; each because/therefore linkage narrows options and carries rising cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open clasp on the velvet mat reconfigures the silence between Lio and Mara with undeniable emotional debt. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“shadowed workshop under stars”) and the diary’s stakes are telegraphed immediately; no ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The workshop’s skylight, velvet mat, and resonator dials function as micro-setting that literally constrain how Lio can act; the “paper-dry scent” of the diary charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean—crates, watchman, square—without white-room drift. Sensory selection mirrors internal stakes: the hush before ignition is rendered through dust-softened footsteps, narrowing perception to the moment the town holds its breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent a misfire into the crowd—is signaled by the diary’s apology and escalates with each crate he tests under time pressure; the tightening is singular but sufficient. Agency is continuous: tuning, reading aloud, swapping shells—each action forecloses delay and risks arrest. Cost is legible: personal exposure to suspicion and the irreversible expenditure of his own safe stock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy is not volume but comprehension of motive under sound. The diary’s shift from locked reproach to open confession reweights “silence” from avoidance to responsibility without moralizing. Final line—“quarrels forgiven”—earns resonance because the town’s shared hush is now safety-verified trust, a concrete social reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lio’s perceptual signature—poets quoted to pigeons, prayer beads against soldering iron—creating a distinct lyrical timbre. Syntax flexes with pressure: long, comma-rich cadence in reflection, then clipped clauses when the watchman challenges. No head-hopping; Mara’s regret is accessed only through the diary’s tremolo, maintaining POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metal clasp locked tight as if the dead owner still guarded a secret” performs metaphor, stakes, and obstacle in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective—reserved for hinge moments—so the final “glitter settling” lands clean without purple drag.</comment>

<comment>Premise fuses pacifist sound-engineering with emergency bomb-disarm via acoustic resonance—fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. The locked diary as solidified interpersonal silence is a specific, irreplicable metaphor that reconfigures at closure. Risk-taking (quiet shell swap instead of explosive showdown) heightens stakes without gimmickry, proving originality arises from character logic, not shock.</comment>
