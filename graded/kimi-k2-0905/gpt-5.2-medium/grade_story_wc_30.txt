<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian’s trembling neoprene hands and the quiet permission of the final naming give a felt cost, but the interior contradiction between forgotten past and present service is told more than enacted in scene; one more micro-choice under pressure would have pushed it to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank bookmark accepted and the creel carried into the tide reconfigure identity without forcing epiphany; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the moonlit pattern of names and contradictions tightens into the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium’s breathing grates and salt-slick shelves constrain every move; the creel’s shift from relic to net for lost names charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through the librarian’s invented ritual—smelting bookmarks, lowering the creel—each act narrowing options under the moon’s rule; the cost is legible yet stays moderate because the city never pushes back hard enough to threaten the ritual itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the creel’s catch: identity as something both lost and chosen anew; the final image of wobbling shelves “learning to migrate” reweights the premise without moralizing, letting wonder and routine coexist in charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person texture is distinct—jointed bronze, clipped coin moon, “paper and salt do not forgive”—and sustains rhythmic control through lyric compression; the patterned elision of temporal markers is taught early and pays off in the closing tide-murmur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with the tide, information density stays high, and no loops or scaffold intrude; one mixed metaphor—“moon hung like a clipped coin”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The moon-phased amnesia city feels inevitable yet fresh because the librarian’s smelted bookmarks convert a surreal premise into tactile emotional practice; risk in structure and concept heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
