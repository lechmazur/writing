<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jiro’s quiet hunger to “learn why their hands ached” is concrete and embodied; the whisk-as-philosophy moment crystallizes his interior contradiction. Ren’s shift from mockery to bowed gratitude is legible, though his interiority is thinner—his confession feels slightly summarized rather than lived. The final bow with the whisk shows visible cost and earns the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ren’s promise to “mend what he broke” reconfigures his stance under moonlight, cost felt in the quiet tea froth. Causal chain holds—whistle → pattern recognition → guard placement → smuggler caught—without coincidence resolving. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, taught by repeating lattice imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wet stone “breathing like a choir,” moonlit cracks as stepping-stones, and the whisk’s lattice shadows are selective, POV-filtered, and tactically used. The parapet’s silver seams literally guide Ren’s footfalls, so environment constrains choice and charges the final image. No static postcarding; every sensory note advances mood or motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hidden effort must be honored”—tightens when Ren recognizes that watchfulness also frays like twine. One meaningful deepening: moon-path tracking turns abstract appreciation into tactical advantage, foreclosing the smugglers’ route. Cost is visible: Ren’s public bow despite fishermen’s indifference signals social risk. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lattice imagery: invisible labor holds civilization as knots hold nets. Final tea froth reweights the whisk from absurd ornament to sacramental tool—earned, not declared. Subtext in Ren’s silent bow avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether fishermen will ever notice. No late thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Jiro’s perceptual signature—“tarred twine,” “blinked like brief prayers”—then cleanly shifts to Ren without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during capture. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: Jiro’s whistle answers a question Ren hasn’t yet articulated. Register never drifts above the characters’ craft vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layers (“moon in shreds”) stay coherent and never stack during the high-pressure smuggler beat. One paraphrase loop—“hidden effort…quiet courage behind a watch”—could trim, but it doesn’t touch closure. Density remains high: each sentence braids sensory, symbolic, and causal work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: net-mending philosophy + moon-path criminology turns artisanal patience into security intelligence. Bamboo whisk repurposed as lantern, baton, and finally tea-tool feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk in slow, lyric escalation pays off because the final image crystallizes stakes without exposition. Not a trope retread; specificity makes the concept unportable.</comment>
