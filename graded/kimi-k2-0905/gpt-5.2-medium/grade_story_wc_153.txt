<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory need to keep the shard yet risk its healing, her embodied ritual of tearing unsealed letters, and the final micro-choice to hand the smoothed shard to Elias all track. Interiority stays concrete (“breath between pride and surrender”). The apology is earned because the text makes her rehearse it in front of spirits first; cost is the blood that rises and closes. Only restraint from 9: Elias’s interior remains opaque, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: the apology is finally spoken, the condensation message vanishes, the shard is transferred—cost legible in the moon-smoothed edge and the letters never sent. Causal chain holds: shard wound → moon healing → spirit rehearsals → brother’s arrival → apology. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (stilt house, dusk). One transition (night 1 → night 4) is cleanly marked. No lens ambiguity; causal logic drives every beat.</comment>

<comment>Mangrove roots “clasp ankles like questions,” the salt-filmed window, and the moon’s tactile polishing of stone all constrain action: she can’t move fast, must breathe on glass, must wait for light. The shard functions as micro-setting that evolves from weapon to reconciled token. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara notices wet, salt, song, not tourist geography. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff nudges roots, breath meets glass, hands exchange shard.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will she voice the apology—tightens when spirits command DO NOT CHOOSE YET, forcing her to rehearse instead of flee. The shard’s edge smooths only after three nights of practiced vulnerability, a visible price that forecloses permanent retreat. Escalation is causal: each night’s letter-writing deepens risk of exposure until Elias’s arrival makes silence impossible. Cost is on-page: blood, shredded paper, the shard’s lost jaggedness.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of “unsent” as a courage problem, not a postal one. Subtext lives in gesture: handing over the healed shard = surrendering the right to stay wounded. Final image of dissipating condensation reweights earlier ghostly writing as rehearsal space rather than verdict. No moralizing; the story lets the object’s changed state argue forgiveness.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual signature: “paper could steady a heart,” “names hummed.” Syntax lengthens during lyric passages, then fractures into short clauses at the apology beat, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; Elias’s wariness is shown only through Mara’s reading of his stance. Dialogue is minimal but indirection-rich: “Say it here” carries full stakes.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the reader through 782 words without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. No paraphrase loops; each image advances stakes (“tearing into strips that she floated” simultaneously acts and symbolizes release). Copy is clean; only one filter verb cluster (“she felt fierce tenderness flare”) is acceptable under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing gothic courthouse relic with mangrove spirit mediumship feels fresh; the shard’s moon-healing reframes architectural debris as relational sacrament. The “unsent letter” trope is inverted—destroying drafts becomes the prerequisite for speech. Risky choice to keep Elias off-stage until final paragraph pays off by making the apology the first live dialogue. Specificity of place and ritual prevents template drift.</comment>
