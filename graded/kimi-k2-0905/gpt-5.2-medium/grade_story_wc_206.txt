<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ivo’s quiet competence and the embodied moment of “mending what isn’t torn” give him clear motive and micro-choice; the interior contradiction (borrowing forbidden stone, risking truth) is present but remains summary until the final ascent, softening the felt cost. The oathfern’s live feedback is a nice externalized conscience, but the emotional stakes stay cerebral rather than visceral. Still, the arc of repairman-as-healer-of-darkness is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stolen light is returned via Ivo’s tuning act, midnight is re-balanced, and the cost—binding to truth, exposure of hollowness—is on-page (“oathfern still un-wilted”). Causal chain holds: chip → resonance → confession → tuning → dawn. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 6. One minor slack: the Thief’s instant capitulation feels abrupt, but the resonant reconfiguration satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass lungs, copper cathedral, wire-as-bow: every tactile detail is filtered through Ivo’s craft perception and directly enables his listening tactic. The resonance chamber micro-setting constrains the final tuning act, charging the closure image. Weather and geography stay stable; no white-room moments. Slight over-glitter in “headache of quiet” but density remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light”—is signaled early and tightens when the Thief opens its empty cradle, forcing Ivo to trade truth for repair. One meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is conceptual (truth-binding, potential rust) rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.5 band where a tangible price would be visible on Ivo’s body or tools.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “honest repair versus hidden decay” emerges through the Covenant, oathfern, and the hollow Thief; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of new music-box in window reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: rust still waits, covenant still binds. Avoids sentimentality yet delivers resonant aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; diction stays within Ivo’s mechanical lexicon (“tremors like a stringed instrument”). Rhythm modulates—long cathedral sentences vs. clipped ascent—mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext perceptually. One filter-verb cluster (“he could read…”) but not in peak beat; still allows high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong auditory and tactile specificity; sentences vary in length and openers. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevate—“headache of quiet” pushes abstract—but metaphor coherence holds. Information density high; every clause advances image or tool-use. Minor scaffold in “midnight itself stole the city’s light” could trim, yet propulsion never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing horologist myth with rust covenant feels fresh; “mending what isn’t torn” as ontological repair is non-obvious. Midnight personified as misaligned mechanism rather than villain avoids cliché. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off: silence presses on teeth, dawn seeps through pendulums. Transformation test passes—story collapses without Ivo’s specific craft logic.</comment>
