<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The restorer’s contradictory motives—family guilt vs. vocation of repair—are embodied in the trembling hand and needle; the final choice to break the vow costs the ancestral storm and the hush itself, grounding the dead through his own heartbeat. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. One slip: the ancestor’s instant acceptance feels slightly faster than the accumulated dread warrants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because each knot loosens a syllable, therefore the slab opens and the hush snaps into breath—an earned Decisive Change with the family vow’s rupture as visible cost. Orientation is swift (quartz staircase, midnight, hook-marked slab). Only the thinnest wobble: the “secret across sharing” device is introduced once and never re-used, leaving the vow’s exact wording slightly vaporous.</comment>

<comment>Prism walls bend starlight into corridors, the salt-mirror chamber reflects the protagonist’s face back as stormlight—setting actively guides the unraveling and final stitching. The tapestry needle itself functions as micro-setting, its cold eye against the net constraining every finger-move. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and muffled underwater bells, mirroring the hush. No postcard drift; each descriptor either tightens the knotwork or charges the mask’s final breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the storm or the dead stay adrift—tightens with each syllable regained; the final knot forces the restorer to pay with his true name, a felt price that forecloses ancestral silence. Escalation is linear but sufficient: every loosened knot = +1 unit of sound = +1 unit of personal exposure. No off-stage rescue; the risk is tested on the slab in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: vows born of fear become cages; repair must sometimes mean unmaking. The breathing mask at dawn reweights every earlier act of mending as provisional, giving the ending conceptual resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—needle cord like a charm, palm on chest—never in thesis statements. Ambiguity lingers: the sanctuary’s quiet is now chosen, not imposed, inviting re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a lapidary cadence that modulates under pressure—short clauses when courage falters, lengthened sentences as starlight threads wrap wrists. Perceptual signature is consistent: salt taste equals time, syllables ring underwater, prisms refract grief. No head-hop; the ancestor’s dialogue is reported through the restorer’s bodily shock. Register stays within a craftsperson’s lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—description advances knot-by-knot action; metaphors (stormlight heart, eyelid slab) remain coherent and physically grounded. Rhythm breathes with beats: caesuras mimic held breath before slab opens. One micro-loop: “interlaced hush” is repeated three times in close succession; however, the phrase is the story’s title-concept, so the echo reads intentional rather than artifact. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing net-making, mask-restoration, and storm entrapment creates a fresh mythic engine; the notion that silence is a centuries-old suffocated breath feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specificity—quartz staircase, salt mirrors, hook and wave glyph—anchors the fantastical in tactile labor. The piece could not swap settings or crafts without collapsing; transformation is complete.</comment>
