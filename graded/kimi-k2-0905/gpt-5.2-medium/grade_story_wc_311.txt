<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaper’s grief is palpably embodied in every micro-choice—how he palms dust to write a name, how he angles mirrors to wound himself with memory—so the interior contradiction is alive in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the named crystals behind) is earned because each prior naming loosened his own ribs; the cost is the lover’s name still locked in iron behind his teeth. Only the lover remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; the single-POV pressure is sufficient. The heartbreak never slides into diagnostic label-speak; it stays a visceral hollow that dictates tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the unnamed lover’s sob-crystal tucked under the blank ocean reconfigures the atlas from terror to mercy, and the cost is the reaper’s permanent exile from his own goodbye. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystallized phrase adds density until the final blank space becomes unbearably legible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“dome still smelled of cold brass”) and never wavers. No causality break; every mirror adjustment and naming act is a because/therefore linkage under scattered light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass, rain-smell, and fractured beams are not backdrop; they are the very instrument that converts sound into crystal, hence into names. The atlas page’s serpents shrink only when touched by the reaper’s dust-writing finger, making the micro-setting an active crucible. Light as tool meets the requirement that environment constrain choice: he must angle mirrors precisely or the voices remain formless. Spatial choreography is flawless—cylinders, table, lens, and mirrors stay trackable across every small move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he survive carrying unnamed fears?”—tightens when each naming forecloses the option to keep the lover’s memory sealed. The pressure escalates by accretion: every new crystal adds weight to his scythe-side silhouette until the final blank ocean space forces the last sob into the map. No coincidence; the lifeboat recordings arrive by river of departure, a causal given of his occupation. Cost is visible: the lover’s unspoken name remains iron in his mouth while the strangers’ names are freed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of naming: terror diminishes when addressed, yet love’s unnamed absence grows heavier—a paradox crystallized in the final blank ocean square. No moralizing; the reaper’s quiet exit lets the atlas breathe its new, smaller monsters. Subtext lives in gesture—his fingertip writing in dust rather than speaking the one name that still kills him. The echo of sacrifice is reweighted: it becomes gift rather than wound once uttered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: brass tastes like rain, dusk fractures into bridges, and every noun is scraped by mortality. Rhythm modulates—long clauses when grief pools, abrupt fragments under light-shard bursts—without ever losing immediacy. No filter verbs; perception is direct: “I pressed my palm to the paper and listened, not with ears but with the hollow.” The lyric compression is taught by line 3 and paid off in the final salt-bright shard.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double labor: “His laughter scattered through the light, crystallized, and became a string of beads I could lay along the map like a safe harbor” simultaneously advances action, deepens metaphor, and reweights stakes. No paraphrase loops; each image introduces new physical logic. Figurative language peaks at the closure beat yet stays coherent—mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional elevated diction (“atlas page with sea monsters”) is voice-motivated for a death-cartographer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses maritime ghost-archive with astronomical necromancy in a way that feels inevitable once begun. The risk—turning disembodied voices into literal crystals under fractured starlight—pays off because the physics of grief is already established. Transformation test fails if reaper is swapped with generic psychopomp; the lover’s iron-tasting name and the atlas-specific serpents are non-transferable. Fresh inflection: cartography as exorcism, lighthouse as phonograph.</comment>
