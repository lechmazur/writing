<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses throughout: shame vs. need to repair, hiding vs. exposure. The amber hand-off crystallizes a hierarchy of values—guilt, memory, future agency—paid for with the last protected object. Micro-choices (hood up, slow step from vines, pressing pendant to foil) embody cost without exposition. One hairline slip: “protected vulnerability” is named, not dramatized, in final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: viral shame → flight to moss garden → drip-map encryption → pendant key → Jun’s acceptance. Each beat forecloses retreat; the pendant, once safety, becomes the price of restitution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: archive seeded, name forever exposed, pendant gone—cost legible in the emptied palm. Orientation anchored by 110 words; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Server-tombstones under green quilts, icicle drip percussion, resin sealing foil—every sensory layer constrains the encryption act and charges the final amber impression. Spatial choreography is immaculate: curtain of vines, aisle, broken vents, river mud on Jun’s boots all tracked without drift. Environment supplies both the material of the key (drip-pattern) and the social invisibility required for the scene. Micro-setting (foil sheet, coolant pipe) functions as crucible for the decisive micro-choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restitution without erasure—tightens when the only shield (pendant) is surrendered to Jun. One meaningful deepening: drip pattern shifts from ambient detail to encryption matrix, narrowing options to “give away last secret or fail.” Cost is visible: protagonist leaves with neither anonymity nor relic. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no artificial reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as composted confession: betrayal can rot into nutrient only when fully exposed to predators. Subtext lives in gesture—Jun weighing the pendant in silence, drip code sealing complicity. Final image of “confession compost” reweights earlier shame from terminal stain to living humus. No moralizing; resonance carried by foil scarred with thaw and pollen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person texture is consistent: sap-tasting quiet, server ribs, “green quilts” reflect a mind that metabolizes grief through botanic code. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during Jun’s arrival, mirroring guarded breath. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature remains intact under stress. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Jun’s first question—“what now?”—cuts exposition, signals relationship shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for moss hush, staccato drip sentences for encryption urgency. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“servers lay like tombstones”), paid off in resin seal. One loop risk: “quiet that tasted of sap” echoed as “honeyed hush” could read as synonym churn, but cadence shift differentiates. No scaffolding; every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of cyber-crime and moss garden feels inevitable, not grafted; data-center-as-crypt offers fresh ecological restitution trope. Drip-encryption key is a specific, non-portable invention that would collapse if setting swapped. Risk taken in quiet climax—no chase, no servers exploding—yet stakes feel higher because exposure is irreversible. Minor proximity echo to “compost” metaphor trending in eco-fiction, but execution here is grounded in pendant biology.</comment>
