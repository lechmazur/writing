<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—rule-bound surveyor vs. clandestine archivist—are dramatized in every beat: she measures, then secretly writes; she placates the council, then wrests the hook. The inkwell as maternal relic anchors motive without exposition, and the final stone she sets herself crystallizes a hierarchy of values (memory over career) with felt cost. Only the skiff fight feels slightly convenient; Beran’s sudden appearance is the single unmotivated spike that keeps her from a 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the drawbridge up, Beran trapped, Lira on the firm shore with the warm inkwell—options reconfigured, cost legible. Causal chain holds throughout: because the pavilion sank, because the council denies it, because Lira needs to inscribe memory, therefore she infiltrates, writes, seals, and sets the stone. No orientation drift; who/where/when land by line 50. One micro-turn (Beran’s intrusion) tightens rather than breaks the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The drowned pavilion is not backdrop but antagonist: weed-curtains snag oars, trapped air pockets dictate lantern flutter, silt clouds blind Beran. Micro-setting of the brass inkwell—warm against ribs—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; every oar-stroke, pillar, and stone stack is trackable. Environment literally constrains the final choice: only by wedging the note underwater can she guarantee mortar will entomb it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering interlaced absence—tightens when council denial + Beran’s hook threaten erasure. Escalation is causal: each secret note increases exposure; the final wrest risks capture yet secures the archive. Cost is visible: wet sleeves, bruised ribs, professional exile implied by barred drawbridge. One tightening suffices; no loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: official measurement (erasure) vs. clandestine inscription (preservation). The sealed vellum strips reweight “foundation” from civic to mnemonic, a conceptual repricing paid for by Lira’s career risk. No moralizing; final line “I am still listening” is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will the pavilion rise again or remain a submerged reliquary?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lira’s perceptual filter: moonlight as “pale ladders,” inkwell warmth as approval. Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic resistance, then fractures during skiff impact. No head-hop; Beran’s aggression is read only through Lira’s senses. Register remains river-worker precise, never drifts into lit-crit abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or obstacle. Figurative layer is spare—only “curtains of weed,” “pale ladders”—and paid off by action. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases breath. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Flooded pavilion as civic memory-vault is fresh; using foundation mortar as archival medium is non-obvious and inevitable once revealed. The inkwell-as-relic trope is transformed by its survival of immersion and its literal warmth against skin. Risk—quiet lyric infiltration rather than thriller—heightens stakes without gimmick. Synthesis of urban planning, maternal ghost, and submerged architecture feels singular.</comment>
