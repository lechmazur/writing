<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory need to shield Eli yet carry her own guilt is dramatized through the porcelain box she still drags uphill; the micro-choice to confess is earned by the embodied ache of pack straps cutting “old burns.” Interiority stays concrete—stars “measure” miles, wax “stubborn” holds cracks—avoiding label-speak. Jonah’s parallel fear is sketched efficiently, but his voice converges toward hers in the final exchange, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she lied then, she must confess now; the cracked box object anchors every beat, its final hand-off crystallizing the before/after. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she forecloses her own clean conscience with the line “it had cost her the right to sleep,” a felt price that reweights the bargain. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props or logic drift. One tightening turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, pack cutting burns, porcelain fractures glazed “like small rivers” fuse external terrain with internal scar; the path’s incline literally slows them, giving space for the confession. Celestial motion tracks elapsed time, mirroring the slow shift in Jonah’s stance. Micro-setting—the box in moonlight—charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail (sap-scream, wax seam) keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she keep translating pain without self-annihilation? Pressure tightens once: the bargain she once used to save Eli now blocks her own sleep and Jonah’s growth. Her decision to confess narrows future options—she will face investigation, Eli will learn shame—visible cost legible on page. No coincidence; escalation is internal but irreversible, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fracture metaphor: integrity can include a visible break if light gets in. Subtext lives in the box’s silence—two marbles, no words—implying that protection can stunt as well as shield. Final image of Jonah carrying the lesson “like a lantern” reweights the earlier lie into generative responsibility. No moralizing statement; resonance is imagistic, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual filter—stars “measure,” wax “stubborn,” fractures “small rivers”—syntax lengthens under contemplation then shortens at the reveal. No head-hopping; Jonah’s interior is inferred only through gesture and dialogue, preserving distance. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial bodies,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges above firefighter vernacular but reads as her private translation idiom, consistent with the thematic drive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: “pack cutting into old burns” does body, history, and sensation in five words. Rhythm modulates from long moonlit sentences to staccato confession beats. One mixed metaphor—“crown of fire around his family cabin”—is fleeting amid otherwise clean vehicles. No scaffold loops; pronouns track cleanly after subject shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Wildfire-guilt confession stories are common; freshness comes from the porcelain grandmother’s button box as containment vessel for moral fracture, and from the inversion that protecting innocence can itself become violence. The bargain-to-confess arc is familiar, yet the marbles’ singed survival offers a tactile, specific image not seen before. Risk level is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but execution is precise.</comment>
