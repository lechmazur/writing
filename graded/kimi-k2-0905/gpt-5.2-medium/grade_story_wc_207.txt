<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “sensibly eccentric” label is shown, not told—she labels rain jars yet pays bills. Interiority stays concrete: the compass hinge clicks “as though it has joints of memory,” a sensory, character-specific image. The final renunciation—leaving the compass and pouring petrichor into the lagoon—carries visible cost because she relinquishes both proof and possession. One hairline slip: “she understands why she has come” is slightly abstract, but the next sentence immediately grounds the insight in the lagoon image, so the epiphany remains earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the factory’s origin story reweights the whole quest and the compass becomes a warning, not a tool. Causal chain holds—each psychometry reading escalates knowledge and tightens options until renunciation is the only graceful exit. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“empty loading yard”) and the single time-skip (“Then she walks north…”) is legible. One micro-drag: the sentence “She holds it and performs her method” could more smoothly cue the first psychometry beat, but causality remains intact.</comment>

<comment>Setting is filtered through Mara’s collector gaze: rain is sorted by street and season, solvents jars re-purposed for scent. The lagoon’s “black water cupped in white” is tactile and specific; mist softens sound, forcing reverence that guides her final offering. Spatial choreography is clean—headlamp, compass, wading to thighs, shelf of rock—no impossible moves. Environment constrains the climax: the compass points straight down only when pressed to wet limestone, a literal and figurative terminus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the place “where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightens with each psychometric revelation. The second hinge-snap inside the tunnel forces the choice: keep chasing certainty or accept the lagoon’s hush. Cost is visible: she sacrifices the compass and a jar of petrichor, tangible losses that foreclose further mapping. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the second vision; a final external obstacle (cold, depth) could have sharpened the 8.8+ edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and mystery: a collector who catalogs rain must finally surrender what she bottled. The factory’s buried origin—an attempt to “bottle this hush”—re-prices the entire quest without moralizing. Final image of pouring petrichor back into the lagoon offers a non-literal answer: some sensations must be returned to the unownable. No thematic echo sentence mars the ending; resonance is carried by action and scent alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person narration keeps Mara’s perceptual signature—petrichor taxonomy, solvent jars, hinge-as-joint metaphor—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens during descent (“water threads over pale stone…”) then compresses at the climactic hinge-snap, mirroring breath. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. One clause drifts toward elevated register: “subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs” could be simplified to stay inside Mara’s vernacular, but the lapse is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical yet propulsive: “cold image rises of men in oilcloth, lanterns bobbing” does three jobs—temperature, sight, motion—in six words. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“she feels another awakening”) where interiority is required. Final paragraph varies rhythm with short declaratives after a long sinuous sentence, closing on the quietly hinged “open enough.”</comment>

<comment>The petrichor-collector who practices psychometry on a faulty compass is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist here. The factory-as-origin-of-hush reconfigures familiar post-industrial decay into myth without exposition dumps. Risky second-person immersion inside the expedition vision pays off by making the warning intimate. If names or places were swapped the scent-archive quest would collapse—proof the concept is irreplaceable.</comment>
