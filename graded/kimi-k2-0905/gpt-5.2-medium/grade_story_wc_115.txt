<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s skeptical-mill-explorer identity is vividly embodied in sensory beats (grease-beaded wheel, radio psychics) and drives every micro-choice; the final refusal to carry Mara’s silence is earned through the ghost-shift ordeal. Interior contradiction—drowsy yet alert, rational yet compelled—remains active in-scene. Only the absence of on-page Mara limits full relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: confession → tunnel → valve → ghost bay → badge reveal → renunciation; each turn forecloses an option and raises cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he will call, not forgive—with the concrete cost of bearing Mara’s guilt into the world. Orientation is swift; the lens holds without wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s wet-iron breath, the beaded wheel’s grease-glass catch, and the wool-and-cigarette pocket of the ghost bay are selective, POV-filtered, and tactically active: the valve literally opens the plot. Micro-setting (wheel, radio, badge) constrains the final choice. One decimal off perfection only because the mill exterior is sketched in shorthand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of swallowed truth”—tightens when the ghost shift materializes and the badge reveals Mara’s murder. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: turning the wheel, interrogating the dead man, reversing the valve. Cost is visible: he exits ready to destroy Mara’s cover. No safety resets.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as palpable, dangerous mass—emerges through the valve’s literal weight, the ghost shift’s accounting, and the final refusal to keep hiding. Subtext in the radio callers’ lies mirrors Mara’s long buried guilt. No moralizing; the ending image of the sealed tunnel reconfigures meaning without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is razor-specific: “hear my own eyelids click,” “throat of brick,” “worrying a badge as if it were a rosary.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments, sensory stacking—yet stays readable. Perceptual signature (skeptical salvage-logic) never slips. Radio voices are distinct without stealing focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries double duty: sensory + stakes or metaphor + causality. No scaffold, no loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the ghost bay then exhales with the final turn. A single hairline slip—“the tunnel breathed” is borderline personification—but it pays off via valve causality, so barely grazes the 9+ ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing talk-radio psychic junkies with an industrial ghost-shift ledger feels utterly fresh yet inevitable; the after-life as unpaid overtime is darkly hilarious and thematically perfect. Specificity of the beaded valve, the chalk cross, the dented tag transforms tropes. Risky compression succeeds; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
