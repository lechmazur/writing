<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s private hunger for arboreal witness is concrete and embodied; the moment the sextant ticks sorrow out of his own chest we feel the cost. Interiority stays particular—no therapy-speak—and the final refusal to file a report crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The only bar to 9+ is that the contradictory impulse (duty vs. witness) is stated more than it is dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-built outward-leading labyrinth reweights the entire municipal premise. Causal chain holds—each bolt he loosens is a because/therefore step toward that reconfiguration—and the cost (his unreported transgression, the sextant’s ongoing hunger for his own grief) is visible in the final smile. Lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-lit tower, moonlit sextant, and salt-wet sapling are filtered through the maintainer’s tool-belt gaze; every detail either calibrates grief or points to the roof route. The pines finally constrain the choice to dismantle inward. Micro-setting (drain-grown oak) charges the climax; only a hair of excess description in the opening storm keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he settle for quantified sorrow or seek living witness—tightens when the sextant begins measuring his own nights. One meaningful escalation: the maze shifts at the pin-drop, forcing him to decide whether to preserve or release the dream-flakes. Cost is legible: each tick subtracts grief from his chest, foreclosing the safety of anonymous maintenance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of measurement: the town files sorrow to forget, the trees store it to remember. Final image of the outward labyrinth answers the thematic question without moralizing—grief must remain hearable, not merely countable. Subtext resides in the sextant’s silent ticks and the unfiled report, not in any character sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—arithmetic of sadness, storm ink on glass, dream-flakes in glove seams—never drifting into generic lyricism. Compression (“the thing had a snapped index arm…”) teaches the reader to accept elision. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. One clause of academic diction (“Conceptual Repricing”-like phrasing in reflection) nicks the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—sweeping grief-flakes while foreshadowing the roof route. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “windows into sheets of moving ink” is earned. One paraphrase loop (“my duty was to keep the stones aligned…”) and a minor filter-verb cluster (“I felt the weight…”) keep it from 9+. Otherwise propulsive, clean, and read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The quantified-sorrow bureaucracy plus moon-healing sextant plus arboreal witness is a synthesis I haven’t seen; risk lies in the overtly magical repair, but the story commits fully and follows the implication to an outward labyrinth. Specificity of drain-grown oak and dream-envelope cartography makes the concept un-pasteable. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious—high originality.</comment>
