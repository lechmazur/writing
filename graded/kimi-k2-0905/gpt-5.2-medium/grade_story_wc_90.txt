<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—refusing weapons, sewing photos instead of using AI, naming her cruelties aloud—so the trait drives the final push. The interior contradiction between guilt and compassion is kept active in scene, not summarized. The only bar to 9 is that Lio’s single spoken question feels slightly engineered to let her articulate the vow she has already lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the hatch opens not by force but by the accumulated weight of named shadows, re-weighting the premise that only violence opens doors. The causal chain (quilt → tear → honesty → hatch) is legible and lands with persistent cost—Mara must keep forgiving to stay physically present. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of shimmer-to-thread taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ship-as-grave is rendered through tactile scrap—vacuum-seal thread, welded hatch, solar-tile chapel—each object constrains action (thread limits sewing, hatch demands honesty). Micro-setting (body floating toward ceiling) physically externalizes joy-as-risk, charging the final image when she lets go. One hairline slip: “municipal scrap” is too abstract amid otherwise specific salvage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find a door that is not an airlock—tightens when the only key is admitting unforgiven cruelty. One meaningful deepening: shimmer map turns from archival clue to living silver thread, foreclosing the option to keep memories sealed. Cost is visible—oxygen lost while floating, psychic cost of naming shadows—but the external pressure plateaus after quilt completion; hatch yields almost immediately once tear is poured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “compassion is the only propulsion that outlives the species.” Subtext lives in gesture: letting herself float toward the hatch is a wordless surrender to interdependence. Final mist-garden corridor reconfigures meaning without moralizing—birth is possible only after metabolizing collective grief. No thematic echo violations; no tidy maxim replaces embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature—air recyclers hiss like surf, photos glint like candle ghosts. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short clauses when she lifts: “she grips a handrail, laughing soundlessly.” No head-hopping; Lio’s dialogue is spare, adolescent, distinct from her interior cadence. One filter-verb cluster (“she feels...she feels”) in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causal nudge: “thread pulled from vacuum suit seals” tells material, stakes, and scarcity in five words. Rhythm ascends with Mara’s body, then releases in a breath-long final sentence that mirrors the hatch opening. Two adjacent “she”-openings create minor scaffold; not enough to dull closure. No mixed metaphors; figurative logic stays coherent (salt track → mercury → silver thread).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Pacifist portal fantasy built from scrapyard grief feels genuinely new. The gravitational joy mechanic reverses the usual “weight of sorrow” trope and makes physics serve ethics. Shadow-work as literal navigation tech transforms therapy language into plot engine without gimmickry. Risk is high—quiet climax, no antagonist—but commitment to the logic makes the ending feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
