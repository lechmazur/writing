<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses in every beat: the narrator both courts and dreads the glow, clings to yet distrusts the advisor, presses the swan until it draws blood. Embodied emotion is vivid—"lungs tasted of pennywater," "heartbeat matched its flicker"—and the final micro-choice (twisting the clasp to drink the light) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: annihilation of the image over self-preservation. The only bar to 9 is a hairline excess of diagnostic self-labeling ("photographically cursed") that slightly cools the immediacy of peak fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the gray, ordinary photo strip proves the curse has been starved of its light, and the funhouse goes dark—cost felt in the bite of metal and the advisor’s silence. Causal linkage holds: because the clasp siphons the luminance at the instant of capture, the image cannot keep the narrator, therefore fear loses its proof and collapses. Orientation is anchored by word 30 ("abandoned carnival funhouse at the edge of town") and the lens—Causal—remains stable. Persistent constraint: the clasp must wound the wearer to work, a price that shapes the final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is not postcard backdrop; the fungus-breathing mirrors and flash-bulb "swollen like a maggot" actively narrow options and supply the only tool that can defeat the curse. Micro-setting—the twisted-swan clasp pressed to skin—functions as the hinge that reconfigures the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → Hall of Snapshots → Tilted Corridor → booth, each zone feeding the next beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: taste of pennies, squeal of rubber, cold perfume, then the burn of the flash—details selected, not inventoried.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the photograph-death curse—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the advisor demands the paradoxical sacrifice: be "perfectly seen" yet unseen. One meaningful turn: pressing the clasp until it bites and drinks the light forecloses the option of ever using the glow again; the price is blood and permanent ordinary grayness. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each mirror-strip increases the lure to stare until the heartbeat syncs, raising the cost of failure. The final choice narrows options to a single shutter-click that either annihilates the image or the self—visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of representation: to starve fear one must surrender the seductive luminance of being seen. The photo strip’s reversion to gray reweights every prior glowing image; the funhouse darkness literalizes the conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in gesture—the swan’s backward neck暗示 self-consumption—and the advisor’s final unmasking as the narrator’s own exhaled breath. No moral is stated; the aftereffect is a chill recognition that erasure, not perfection, is the price of survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: metallic tastes, spoiled-milk moonlight, hungry shadows—idiosyncratic, consistent. Rhythm compresses under pressure—"I pressed the swan’s twisted neck until it bit skin"—then elongates in eerie calm. No head-hopping; the advisor’s whisper is external only until revealed as breath. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon while achieving lyric height; the final clause "even the shadows had lost interest" lands with chilling poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: "fungus breathed a cold perfume" does triple sensory duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or tactic. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors per beat at most—and coherent: the flash-bulb maggot, the swan hook, the wet-paint fear. One hairline slip—"repulsive allure" is repeated within sixty words—barely grazes closure. Otherwise, syntax varies, subjects stay strong, and the final line releases with percussive finality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of photographic curse, funhouse mirrors, and paradoxical dream-notes feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope is recycled without transformation. The clasp-as-light-siphon reconfigures a costume prop into existential tool, and the advisor’s self-unmasking reframes the haunted-house guide as internal echo. Risk is taken—lyric compression, causal magic logic—but coherence never fractures. The synthesis could only belong to this narrator at this liminal hour.</comment>
