<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—serene posture vs. shaking calm—grounds every move; the sundial micro-choice at the climax visibly pays the cost of exposing her own cargo-culture complicity. The bargeman’s late confession adds credible pressure, but because he enters after the decisive splice, relationship-as-crucible weight is limited at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: silence → tape → splice → slow turning; the splice beat carries legible social cost when decks empty to confront their scaffolded faith. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the final image of “canal began…to talk” supplies Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—no mechanical wrap-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight canal is no postcard: leaning pier, lapping water, and rusted locker constrain access and hide evidence; the sundial’s shifting shadow becomes micro-setting that charges the final choice. Light, tide, and stilted warehouses track spatially across every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. community comfort—tightens when Mara realizes the tape dates to the Flood Saint week; splice narrows her options to irreversible public exposure. Cost is visible: “she left…knowing she had salvaged choice,” foreclosing her former neutrality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through engineered silence and scaffolded legend; no character moralizes. Final image of the canal “talk in its own voice” reweights all prior pilgrim queues without declaring a thesis, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—“architecture of lies,” “serene upheaval”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates during the splice. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“she could not unsee”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description braided to motive—yet occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing in narration) slightly overshoots POV lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors; prop and body positions track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: state-engineered radio silence as legend incubator, countered by antique sundial forensics. Risk in lyric ellipsis heightens stakes without obscuring causality; premise is inseparable from canal infrastructure and Mara’s cargo-culture guilt.</comment>
