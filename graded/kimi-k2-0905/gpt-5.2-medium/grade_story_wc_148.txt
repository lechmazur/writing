<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The boy’s hunger to “finish” his father’s story by chasing hush is concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (hovering, lattice-listening, leaving the door ajar) flows from that need. Interior contradiction is alive—he both wants the dead named and wants eyes averted—yet the cost is felt only obliquely in the final hush transfer. A hair more embodied price at the climax would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lattice warms in pocket while the boy cedes the future hush to the soon-found bodies—cost is the loss of his private truth. Causal chain holds: because he threads the labyrinth with his own story, he can deposit the words and accept disbelief. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights all prior patterning. No orientation or logic slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison is no postcard: salt-mottled lens, barred whisper-windows, scuffed door-map—these constrain movement and hide the folded keepers. Copperlight repose motif modulates from beauty to menace and charges the final chapel image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; every stair-to-nowhere and heel-mark is tracked. Environment directly enables the hover and the hiding-in-light reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chase hush to finish the story”—tightens once: the boy chooses to relinquish the words to the lattice/sea rather than claim them publicly, narrowing his future to permanent disbelief. Pressure is textural, accumulating through corridor-sound density and the lens’s polite aversion to the bodies. Cost is legible: he trades personal vindication for an anonymous burial of truth. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of the fable: the son embraces the wolf-cry legacy to shield the dead from spectacle, reversing the moral of public disbelief. Subtext lives in gesture—leaving the door ajar, lattice warming in pocket—never in exposition. Final copperlight chapel image reweights the premise: truth may exist only in unwitnessed hush. No platitudes, only charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is irreducibly specific: “copperlight repose,” “beam politely ignored,” “salt ran in stone.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with the boy’s breathless hover. Perceptual signature—sound through pierced oak, weightless listening—never drifts into generic lyricism. Every metaphor is anchored in maritime prison life; no head-hop or register slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: world, body, metaphor in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; rhythm mirrors the rotating beam. Figurative language peaks at the lens moment then thins for the stark dawn, showing purposeful dynamic range. Copy is clean; pronouns and tense flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Inverts the cry-wolf trope into a quiet act of erasure; folds missing keepers into the Fresnel lens as paper silhouettes—image feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk: the boy’s weightless hover could read as magic, but salt-corroded logic and auditory focus ground it as perceptual trance. Specificity of scuffed WOLF child-glyphs and warming lattice makes the myth personal. Synthesis is fresh, not grafted.</comment>
