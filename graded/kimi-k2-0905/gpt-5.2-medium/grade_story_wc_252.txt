<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dock-worker’s poise and steady hands are shown, not told, and the final choice to “detach my own life from the dock” is earned by the scrimshaw beat and Rusk’s opened heart. Interiority stays concrete (“my ribs hum”) and the micro-choice to lever the first chain is legible cost. The only bar to 9 is that Rusk’s shift from warden to willing co-detacher feels slightly accelerated; one more line of visible internal battle would lock it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrimshaw → unlocks Rusk’s guarded heart → permission to free island → protagonist frees self. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the dock apron left as flag, the body stepping into green to “let the sea claim my truest shape.” Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“our docks”), stakes by word 50. No plot amnesia; every chain link is accounted for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Sublittoral fringe” and “knee-deep belt of green water” are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly constrain the action of wading out to unshackle. The disappearing island’s coral roots lifting from sand is an image that reconfigures the world in the final beat. One hairline slip: the exact distance of the skiff relative to the swimmer at night is momentarily fuzzy, but it never breaks spatial clarity enough to dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus belonging—tightens when Rusk’s reopened memory forces him to help release the island, thereby foreclosing the protagonist’s dock identity. The whale call deepens pressure rather than rescuing ex machina; it is set up by the daughter’s childhood whale-song. Cost is visible: the apron abandoned, the father’s “go” cracked with loss. Sufficient for 8.8; to breach 9 we’d need one earlier micro-complication that costs the protagonist physical or social credit on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen transformation emerges through unchaining actions, never sermonized. The scrimshaw’s whale-eye and keyhole reweights from pirate trinket to literal key, then vanishes after its work, leaving resonance rather than message. Final image of stepping into “truest shape” offers Charged Poise without moral tag. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, lyric yet dock-hardened: “coil a hawser like a dancer” marries muscle and grace. Compression (“answered her truer language”) is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping; Rusk’s interior is accessed only via the scrimshaw transfer and his own spoken plea, keeping psychic distance clean. One clause (“he smiled like a man spared”) edges toward authorial interpretation, but it is brief and does not contaminate the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-information lines (“Coral roots lifted from sand, and the whole mass began to drift seaward, half seen”) advance both image and causality. No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise; when it appears (“hair streaming like kelp”) it tightens the maritime lens. Zero scaffolding or synonym loops; every paragraph survives the cut test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accord’s non-violence constraint, the disappearing island as migrant home, and the whale-call key constitute a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high—quiet lyric climax without bloodshed—yet coherence is preserved. Specificity of dock labor and pirate scrimshaw prevents generic fantasy drift. The final reconfiguration (dockworker becomes sea-shape) could not be swapped into another tale without collapsing its entire logic.</comment>
