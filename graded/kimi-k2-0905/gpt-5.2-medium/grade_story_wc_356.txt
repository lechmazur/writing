<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jun’s olfactory gift and wrapping-paper cartography are vivid, embodied, and repeatedly steer her choices; the final acceptance of service over possession is earned through the bloom ordeal. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where ambition and fear collide in a single breath—so the shift feels slightly smoothed rather than scarred. Still, her sensory signature and the tactile doodles make her an individual, not a type.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: scent trail → map → bloom watch → insight → conditional gift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ambition settles into service with the spiral drawing as visible cost. One minor causality bump: the sulfur-honey clue is registered but never explicitly linked to the later clean-fern thread, requiring the reader to bridge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Larkroot’s rope-and-branch architecture is tactile, kinetic, and governs movement; the compost shrine and lantern-lit bloom act as micro-settings that force Jun’s stance shift. Olfactory topography replaces visual catalog, keeping description character-filtered. The seed in her palm at the end re-weights every prior scent cue, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—win the seed—narrows to “earn it without taking it,” tightened by the bloom’s unbearable stench that she must endure to decode the rot-compass. Agency is continuous: she maps, climbs, watches, breathes, accepts. Cost is visceral: knees buckle, paper records the reek, she descends with obligation rather than prize.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “serenity is motion accepted, not stilled,” shown through the swaying branch breathing and the village’s use of decay as renewal. No explicit thesis; the spiral doodle reframes stench and grace as one loop. Final image of the inward-turned paper reweights all prior sketches without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Jun’s nostrils and wrist movements; perceptual signature is consistent—rain has a “signature,” wardens’ laughter carries sulfur. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the branch sway, no head-hopping. One clause (“wildflower hush”) risks poetic intrusion but is anchored early as environmental fact, not narrator flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “grave and ripe pears” collapses disgust and sweetness in four syllables. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, motion, or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“olfactorily,” “journalize”) is justified by Jun’s technical mind and stays within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corpse-flower-as-village-ventilation-system is fresh world logic; wrapping-paper cartography turns domestic recycling into epistemic tool. Risky lyric opening—“turning of the tide’s thought”—is taught as literal tidal calendar, not ornament. Synthesis feels inevitable: rot as compass, doodle as contract.</comment>
