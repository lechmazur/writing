<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sen’s refusal of easy miracles is embodied in every micro-choice (soap on shrine steps, sealed bottle as lesson); the final council scene crystallizes his renunciation with visible social cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the bottle’s pulse gives a sensory hook for his fear of relapse. The shift from solitary alchemist to charter-founder is earned beat-by-beat; grandchildren test anchors the moral stakes. Only the woman’s return feels slightly under-motivated, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sealed bottle redefined as “the only opening it ever needed” reweights the entire miracle economy with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—salt→soap→woman→charter—each step foreclosing the wish option further. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The final image persists as a constraint shaping future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor posts, nested paper frames, and the coin-gleam function as micro-setting that constrains Sen’s plan; the shrine steps become a literal platform for offering soap and later the council table. Salt crystals and fish-oil lanterns supply tactile resources that alter later tactics. Fog and cracked beams mirror the town’s hollowness without overt symbolism. Bottle-as-micro-object qualifies and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore meaning without miracles—tightens when each returning family asks for the bottle to be opened and Sen refuses, narrowing options to labor-based revival. The meaningful escalation is the charter proposal that forecloses the wish path for the next generation; cost is the permanent loss of effortless luck. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: civilization rebuilt on refusal of false comfort rather than nostalgia for magic. Bottle’s sealed state reweights the premise at closure, offering a non-literal answer—“their revival was the only opening it ever needed.” No final-paragraph sermon; resonance arises from salt, soap, and lanterns rather than abstraction. Ambiguity lingers over whether future generations will keep the bottle closed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Sen; perceptual signature filters everything through alchemical process (lye, crystallized salt, pulse of glass). Syntax is controlled and rhythmic, compressing under pressure (“He feared it was temptation…”). No head-hopping; dialogue limited to one line that carries subtext (“what he wanted for it”). Register remains within Sen’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Figurative language is sparse and precise—“paper frames nested like bones”—never muddies causality. Strong verbs dominate; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. One minor adjective cluster (“salt rotted beams and collapsed roofs”) but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “post-wish ghost-town revived by sealed memory-bottle” synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; no template echo. Risk-taking in refusing to open the bottle pays off thematically and structurally. Specificity of alchemical soap-making and lantern guild charter grounds the concept. Transformation test fails if names change—bottle’s sealed logic is irreplaceable.</comment>
