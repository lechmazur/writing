<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s calm perceptiveness is shown through concrete micro-choices—aligning photos by arcs, asking for diagonals vs curves—which drive every beat; the interior contradiction between private grief and public curatorial composure remains mostly told rather than embodied, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living town now walks “our hurt” together, a palpable before/after shift. Causal chain holds—each donated photo tightens communal stakes—though the single-scene default is stretched by the months-long montage; the final ladder moment crystallizes cost without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender scent softening “metallic taste” and acetate sheets rattling in storm rain embed sensory hierarchy inside Mara’s curatorial attention; the fence–vine interface literally guides where photos can be hung, constraining composition choices. Factory ruins function as more than backdrop—broken wall becomes final mounting point—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared pain be reconfigured into collective meaning?—tightens as each new photo forecloses easier private avoidance; the storm-night choice to hold sheets steady is the visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the pattern break from static grief to mobile communal walk is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: arcs of bodies replace the factory’s ruptured circle, re-weighting loss as connection. Final flicker of candlelit acetate offers non-literal answer—healing is not solved but walked-through—avoiding moralizing. Subtext in Mr. Gant’s quiet crane-hook photo donation carries more grief than any exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual signature—dove-gray case, arc-tracing finger—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates from long lavender sentences to clipped storm beats; diction (“our hurt”) mirrors communal shift. Compression in “word traveled the way lavender scent travels” teaches the associative pattern early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences carry double duty (“widow’s profile joining a coworker’s raised fist” advances both photo placement and social repair). One scaffold loop—“arcs began to answer curves” restates prior beat without new pressure—minor, outside closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; high density maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of a “puzzle archivist” healing a town via photographic arc-matching feels fresh and specific; the collage-walkthrough memorial is not a trope rehash. Risk in letting climax be collective paper-holding during blackout pays off through charged poise. Transformation inseparable from Briarwick’s lavender-fence ecosystem—could not survive relocation.</comment>
