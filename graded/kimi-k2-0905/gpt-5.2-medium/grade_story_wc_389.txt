<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s “variant allegiance” is dramatized in every beat—storm-lit puppet shows vs. radio theft—so interior contradiction lives in action, not labels. The final shared broadcast costs him sole ownership of meaning, a renunciation earned by the prior lonely hoarding. Mara remains half-myth, but her presence still pressures Eli’s choices; the relationship crucible is one-sided yet functional. One hairline slip: “he called it variant allegiance” is diagnostic self-tag mid-climax, −0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the valley’s single cheer is the undeniable social cost of Eli’s relinquished monopoly on hope. Causal chain—stolen fragments → joint transmission → unified audience—holds without teleport. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“observatory above the clouds”) and waived. Persistent constraint: the salvaged gear limits them to junk-built radios, shaping tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt portico stains every visitor ocean-blue, a micro-setting that literally reframes who can be sanctified; this color filter returns in the final dawn under the same glass, recharging the earlier image. Ozone, burnt coffee, and incense are selective, POV-filtered, and disappear when the storm intensifies—perceptual economy that mirrors Eli’s narrowing focus. Spatial choreography holds: puppet stage bolts to telescope, transmitter rewired on-page, bodies track under dome. Tool-as-setting qualifies and constrains the final cloud projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of communal meaning—tightens when Eli must choose between hoarding Mara’s voice or releasing it to the valleys. The reversal is one clean turn: confession → collaboration → shared sky-story, foreclosing solo authorship. Cost is legible: his private dawn becomes public, irreversible. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of shared faith: ancient shadows + scavenged tech = fragile collective hope. No character moralizes; the final blank book is an open invitation, not a thesis. Subtext in Mara’s soldering-iron rosary and Eli’s patched coat fuses tool and relic without exposition. Ambiguity remains—will the valley keep building radios?—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lingers in Eli’s idiom—“collecting believers the way other men collected bolts”—a distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is implied only through Eli’s tuning. Rhythm accelerates with short beats during wiring, then widens for the cloud projection, mirroring emotional crest. Compression taught early (“stormlit observatory…”) pays off in the final strobe-lit image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “lightning sketch equations across the glass” shows weather, metaphor, and Eli’s delusion in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances. One mixed metaphor risk—“blue bruise” beside “sanctified”—reads intentional, so waived. Filter verbs absent under peak pressure; strong verbs drive propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cloud-top observatory, shadow-puppet evangelism, and pirate-radio sermons into an inevitable synthesis that feels newly minted. Risk—gritty whimsy—could slide into twee, but the storm’s violence and the blank-book ending keep it taut. Transformation test fails if names are swapped: cobalt glass, soldering-iron rosary, and scrap-built sunrise are irreducibly specific. +0.4 risk bonus for staging a miracle on junk tech without ironic wink.</comment>
