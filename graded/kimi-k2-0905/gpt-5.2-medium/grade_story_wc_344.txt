<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s want-to-mend drive is concrete from the first paragraph; the father-backstory flash is anchored to the present pick/file choice and tilts her stance. Interiority stays sensory (“saltwood each morning”) rather than diagnostic. The final micro-choice—trading her own picks to forge a new gear—earns the renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the emotional contradiction could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library path narrows to one mirror and Mara exits with the new gear she herself cut, cost legible in the forfeiture of her tools. Causal chain holds: because she reads the prophecy → therefore she re-makes rather than takes → therefore the library releases her. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices at this length; escalation is present but modest, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop: the shifting mirrored corridors literally multiply her options until she chooses, then collapse to a single path—environment directly shaping tactics. Micro-setting (iced table, brass wheel held to pulse) constrains the final filing action. Sensory selection skews visual/thermal, justified by the locale. The “hauntingly bright” powder-air trait enables the moment her breath fogs the prophecy mirror, charging the image that triggers the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tested when the note forbids theft. Pressure tightens once: the prophecy forces her from passive reading to active making, foreclosing the grab-and-run option. Cost is visible (her own picks left behind) and alters later tactics. A second reversal or external antagonist would overstuff 700 words; the single deepening is sufficient, but the felt price could be sharper on the page to reach the 8.8 band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the gear-tooth imagery: repair is not replacement but alignment with what is irreplaceably lost. Subtext resides in the mirror corridor showing multiple futures, resolved when only the single handmade path remains. No final moralizing; the last image of driftwood nostalgia reweights earlier saltwood guilt without naming it. The concept stays integrated with character goal, though the thematic counter-reading (some breaks can’t be mended) is only implicit.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature favors tactile cold, metallic clicks, and pulse-counting—distinctive and consistent. Syntax lengthens during discovery, then shortens under tool-work stress, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Occasional lyric compression (“sunlight ground into powder”) is taught by the opening and remains legible; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat at most—and stays coherent (lock sighs, tide of repair). High information density: each sentence advances goal, image, or causality. A single mixed image (“tired patience of driftwood”) is minor enough not to dull closure. Clean grammar and pronoun reference throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith premise is fresh yet internally logical; the library that remembers missing turns inverts the usual hoard-of-knowledge trope. Mirrors that force self-confrontation risk cliché but here constrain the final choice, so the transformation feels earned. Specific detail—counting gear teeth against her pulse—grounds the concept in lived sensation. Risk is present but safe; no structural experiment beyond lyric compression, keeping it below the top band.</comment>
