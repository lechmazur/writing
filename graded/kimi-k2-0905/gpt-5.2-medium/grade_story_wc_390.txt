<comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—tide-table logic vs. throat-tight grief—grounds every beat; the fork-strike choice crystallizes his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The trader’s micro-confession is embodied (glassy eye “filled with water that looked like melted ice”) rather than diagnostic. Only the two henchmen remain generic, flattening status dynamics and capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: key possession → thieves’ lunge → vibrational matching → confession → key returned as weight of forgiveness. Closure is Earned Stasis: Lio forecloses theft and the trader forecloses vengeance, both carrying felt weight (“the key back in the trader’s palm so the man would feel forgiveness as weight”). Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: floe-groan supplies the cello bass-line Lio matches with the fork, turning pilings into tuning pegs. Copper water, sugar-crack ice, and chapel beeswax are filtered through Lio’s engineer sensorium. The setting literally constrains the final tactic—no other stage could offer that resonant dock—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep relic on island—tightens when sunset clock means crypt opens to anyone with key after dark. One meaningful reversal: would-be robbers become witnesses under sonic pressure; option of violence is foreclosed without blood. Cost is legible: trader’s confession drains into the sustained fork-tone, leaving him “empty-handed” yet quieter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—absolution as tuned resonance rather than verdict—emerges through fork-note, ice-groan, and heartbeat converging into shared hum. No moralizing line; final image of “one shared hum, fleshly ethereal” reweights prior material by making the sacred secularly audible. Ambiguity remains: ghosts may still roam, but living now carry the pitch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lio’s perceptual signature: “calculated tide tables while his throat tightened.” Syntax mirrors engineer precision until fork-strike moment, when fragments mimic metallic ring. No head-hop; trader’s interior accessed only via external cue (water-filled eye). Voice modulation under pressure is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “drift-ice marina creaked like an old ribcage” fuses metaphor and sensory specificity without purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One hairline slip—“confession seemed to drain into the sound like blood into bandage”—leans simile-heavy amid climax, keeping it below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sonic absolution via vibrational matching is a fresh, non-obvious resolution to relic-theft tension; premise could not be transplanted to a non-acoustic setting unchanged. Risk taken: climactic pacification through tuning fork rather than violence, yet mechanics are foreshadowed by lighthouse-bell maintenance. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
