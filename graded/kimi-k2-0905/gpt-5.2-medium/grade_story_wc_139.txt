<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s ledger-in-the-head and “how much truth buys safety” give a sharp, specific internal contradiction; her choice to write Sami’s real story in Mercy’s ink crystallizes that conflict with visible cost. Ivo’s charm remains a touch generic, but his collapse in the face of her refusal lands because the story lets us watch the con fail in real time. The unclaimed woman’s tag used as a moral counterweight is a deft micro-choice that reweights Mara’s values on the page. One hairline slip: “smaller” in the doorway is label-not-shown; a single physical cue would have pushed this to 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mara hides Mercy, because she writes the real affidavit, therefore Ivo’s con collapses and Sami gains shelter. The closure beat—“the prep room’s quiet labor had already priced the truth”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (father’s authority forfeited, daughter’s ethic priced). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“funeral home prep room”) and never drifts. One tiny loop: “quiet labor had already priced the truth” is the second use of “priced”; still, the sentence reweights the premise, so the flaw is cosmetic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stainless table, drain gurgle, and disinfectant/roses fusion create an immediate, tactile crucible; every object (Mercy, toe tag, scalpel tray) is handled, not displayed. Spatial choreography stays clean—Mara pulls the ink from the towel rack, slides the tag, caps the pot—so bodies and props never float. The “formaldehyde inhale” as agents enter is a sensory tightening that mirrors stakes. Only the corridor outside remains a white hole, but the story never needs it; the prep room constrains every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs con—tightens once: Mara’s decision to substitute real for forged affidavit collapses Ivo’s leverage and forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: father’s grin “collapses,” Sami’s fate is re-routed, Mara forfeits her complicity. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. A second tightening beat (agents’ softened questions) is off-camera; had it been on-page, 9.0 was within reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the unpriceable value of unclaimed lives—Sami and the nameless corpse—against marketable narratives. The ink’s margin-eating property literalizes how truth dissolves bureaucratic boxes without sermon. Final image of Mercy beside the corpse’s folded hands reweights the premise: dignity is the only currency left. No moral is stated; the room’s silence is the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: “air tasted,” “drain gurgle like a throat,” “pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence”—all her synesthetic bias. Syntax tightens under pressure: clipped clauses when agents enter, longer braid when she writes margins. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt,” “she thought”) could have been cut, but voice remains distinct and consistent. Dialogue is minimal yet subtextual; Ivo’s “favor, a story, and a cut” is a perfect con-man ledger in one line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with beats: short percussive moves during agent confrontation, liquid cadences when ink bleeds. Figurative layer is selective—ink “liquefies rigid thinking,” tag “a verb that could happen to him”—each metaphor earns its keep and recurs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished without sounding engineered. A single near-repeat of “priced” is the only hairline blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing funeral-home micro-setting with magical-ink political forgery is fresh, yet every fantastical rule is taught early and paid off (ink eats boxes, margins become sanctuary). The asylum procedural is rendered through sensory, moral particulars rather than issue-template. Risk is taken: the climax is a quiet paper slide, not a chase—yet the reconfiguration feels large because the story earned the stakes. Not quite 9.0 because the father-daughter con ethic has faint echoes of familiar grifter dynastics, even if Mara’s math twist is hers alone.</comment>
