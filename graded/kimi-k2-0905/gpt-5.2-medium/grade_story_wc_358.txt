<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The investigator’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is concrete in the final sprint to wreck the spiral, but earlier beats show more instrument-reading than micro-choice; interiority is vivid yet stays in professional register, so the turn feels earned but not wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: patch → spiral → silence → sabotage the ring; the cylindrical container array as acoustic weapon is a satisfying conceptual reveal that reweights the mystery, and the cost—cut fingers, exposure to returning crew—lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Port container maze is tactile and specific, wind mapped as liquid, refrigerated box as silent heart; the metallic threads of the patch function as micro-setting that directly unlocks the final door, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the silence before it spreads—tightens when the investigator realizes the town is collateral; the sprint to vandalize the spiral is a clear irreversible act that forecloses retreat, though escalation is single-arc rather than layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of “foresight built by measuring the haze” emerges through action, not statement; the final noisy rush of everyday life reconfigures the value of ordinary sound without moralizing, though the concept stays more cerebral than emotional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice is crisp, technical, slightly haunted; perceptual signature filters world through airflow, pressure, circuitry—never slips into generic noir; compression and metaphor stay controlled, rhythm accelerates with stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—sensor data, metaphor, forward push; occasional poetic stack (“wind behaved like a liquid”) is earned and pattern-taught; no scaffold loops, no filter-verb clutter; final paragraph lands with clean cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acoustic-canceling container labyrinth feels fresh, the notion of dismantling an entire aircraft into stacked boxes is visually bold; risk is taken and paid off, though the operation’s off-stage villains remain generic, capping originality just below top tier.</comment>
