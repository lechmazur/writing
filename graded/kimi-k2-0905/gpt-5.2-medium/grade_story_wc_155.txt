<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s longing for lost joy is concrete—she carries the fragment, aligns film, paints children back into being—yet her interiority drifts into lyric generalities (“Joy had gone missing… with soft resignations”). The final bow to ghosts crystallizes her wry self-awareness, but the dream logic cushions real risk, so the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the film records her own hand mid-stroke, proving the dream’s method can be carried back. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each moth-note, light-projection, and mural layer thickens meaning until the courtyard reconfigures memory itself. Fog-waived orientation is justified; the disorientation pays off when fog becomes projection screen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Thick fog, splintered sheds, prism lamp, and linen-wrapped fragment are tactile anchors that constrain movement and enable light-painting. The orchard’s ruined scale narrows to the exact recess in the sunken schoolhouse wall, guiding the decisive click. Micro-setting (film strip, prism coils) functions as lived-in tools whose physical states alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when matching scratches force Mara to repaint the children’s silhouettes onto stones, trading passive nostalgia for active creation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the film’s ruined emulsion becomes the very filter that lets ghosts dance. Cost is legible—she exposes her process publicly, relinquishing sole authorship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: art as communal memory, joy as something rebuilt rather than retrieved. The children’s laughter projected onto fog reframes nostalgia into shared present. Final image of inviting passers-by to “join her network” reweights ownership without moralizing. Subtext in the paper-moth instructions avoids overt thesis, letting resonance linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Mara’s perceptual quirks—she notices cider-house rot by how color would cling to it. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under decision (“She bowed… laughing again”). No head-hopping; dream logic justifies compressed elisions. Voice remains distinct even when diction elevates, because elevated perception is her professional lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from sinuous fog descriptions to clipped tool-work, propelling without scaffold. Occasional poetic layering (“fog sat in the branches like old wool”) risks mild density, but metaphor stays coherent and necessary to dream texture. No loops or filter-verb stacks; pronouns track cleanly through surreal transitions. Final line lands with crisp image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Light-painting ruined orchard negatives into living murals is a fresh synthesis; the inversion of exposed film as projector rather than record feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in paper-moth knowledge network pays off by literalizing networked art history. Specific detail—lime halo drawn by a child—prevents allegorical abstraction, grounding novelty in human particularity.</comment>
