<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s guarded kindness and methodical curiosity are shown through tactile map-handling and the refusal to exhibit the erased lives; the final choice to witness rather than seal the chapel feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“air seemed to thicken with unsaid words”) and avoids label-speak. The only gap: no embodied contradiction under peak pressure—her shift to openness is stated more than dramatized in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn margin becomes a visible archive, the shadow’s wandering ends, cost is legible in the rain’s “soft applause” and the chapel’s reopened vulnerability. Causal chain—map tear → video comparison → alcove discovery → reframing—holds without teleport. One transition (shop → moor) is cleanly handled. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, framing knife, and torn chart constrain every move; the henge stones’ applause recharges the ending. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Lena’s profession—creases, ink, damp stone—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from shop counter to stair descent. Weather affects choice: rain dictates timing and acoustic texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give erased parishioners witness—surfaces when Lena reads the crossed-out names. One meaningful tightening: the shadow’s reach toward the alcove forces her to decide whether to remove the maps. Cost is visible: she risks the archivist’s seal order and carries damp evidence uphill. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as custodian of erased lives—emerges through the box of unframed maps, never sermonized. Final image of reopened chapel as living archive reweights the premise without moral. Subtext lives in gesture: Lena films her ascent so “future eyes” inherit the witness. Ambiguity lingers—healing or harm still depends on who listens—avoiding tidy ethics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice carries a map-framer’s perceptual signature—paper creases as biography, ink as breath. Rhythm tightens under pressure: clauses shorten during the stair descent, then widen in the vault’s silence. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Lena’s lexicon. One line approaches purple (“colors washed to pale bones”) but pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “she traced the last confirmed road until it stopped at a ring symbol” advances plot and stakes. No synonym churn or scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (storm-cloud frescoes, seam in earth). One paraphrase loop—“the whisper was the chapel keeping company”—is justified as thematic compression. Strong read-aloud cadence; paragraph cuts pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of archival silence with moving shadow converts a gothic trope into archival ethics; freshness feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—1968 vs 1999 reel labels, red-circled henge—grounds the concept. Risk: reframing a tear instead of repairing it, yet risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Could swap parish names, but the map-framer’s lens is inseparable from outcome.</comment>
