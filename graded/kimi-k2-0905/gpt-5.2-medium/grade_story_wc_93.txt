<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eren’s guilt-driven vigil and final choice to teach rather than flee are credibly rooted in Lysa’s death and the vial promise; the precognitive curse shapes every evasion and rock placement, giving visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—harness rope tightening as guilt, dust map as memory—without diagnostic labels. The renunciation lands as earned stasis: he keeps the vial and starts a new sequence, foreclosing perpetual flight. Micro-choices (shifting one rock to avert an eel’s death) show hierarchy of values in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sea opens, the rope and Lysa’s word “Forgive” appear, and Eren’s future stance crystallizes on-page under the Accumulative/Textural lens—dust helix and rock sequence reweight his guilt into stewardship. Causality holds: each rock shift alters visions, the helix predicts Marel’s arrival, and the final sequence begins because the past literalizes the pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (bluff, aurora, harness). Cost is felt in the tightened harness rope and the vial returned to his neck—persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The frictionless bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery: the inability to grip stone mandates the harness, dictates Eren’s sliding gait, and charges the final walk on glassy sea. Painted rocks, meteor plates, and dust map function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Sensory selection skews to shimmer, slip, and silence—matching precognitive flashes. Environment and recurring objects jointly charge the ending image: the revealed rope and rocks re-anchor both setting and conscience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise to Lysa by decoding the dust—tightens when the helix predicts Marel’s arrival and the sea-door hour looms. One meaningful deepening: the rope’s reappearance shifts guilt from abstract to literal, forcing the choice between perpetual flight or teaching. Agency remains with Eren: each rock placement is a precognitive bet that narrows future options. Cost is visible—harness bruises, vial weight, and the final acceptance of lifelong stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: mathematical sequences versus random loss, forgiveness as a spatial path rather than moral slogan. The final word “Forgive” reweights every prior rock placement without moralizing. Sacred patterns remain ambiguous—both cosmic law and human consolation—inviting counter-readings. Subtext operates in gesture: dust settling equals guilt releasing, eel turns equal prayer beads.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, lyric yet precise: “borrowed dawn that never quite became day” teaches the reader to expect perpetual twilight. Compression (“weeks of borrowed dawn passed like one long inhale”) is patterned early and pays off in the final breath image. No head-hopping; Marel’s entrance is filtered through Eren’s precognitive flash. Syntax mirrors precognition—subordinate clauses arrive before main verbs—without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long aurora sentences to clipped rock counts, propelling the beat. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: dust helix, glassy sea, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence moves placement, vision, or emotional charge. One scaffold trace: “still unfrayed” beside “cluster of painted rocks” could compress, but it does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frictionless physics as spiritual reckoning feels inevitable yet fresh; eel herding as numeromancy is specific to this world. The meteor-plate compass repair grows organically from the premise rather than gadgetry. Risky lyric compression succeeds: the sea opens like a door without breaking causality because rock ratios earned the moment. Transformation test fails—remove any element (dust, harness, eels) and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
