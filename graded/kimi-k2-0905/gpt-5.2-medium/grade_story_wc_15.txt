<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ila’s interiority is lyrically specific—“overlaps,” “footsteps laid over his own”—and her weaving motive is embodied in every beat. The shift from passive watcher to active “sew a path” is visible, but the cost (aproned plate, orchid nets) stays more symbolic than visceral; we feel her conviction more than her skin in the game. Brother’s sleepwalking return supplies backstory catalyst, yet his on-page absence keeps relational crucible off-stage. Still, her haunting optimism drives every micro-choice and the final communal procession reads as earned renunciation of old fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted door becomes a real cleft, townspeople trade torches for orchids, and reverence is re-stitched into being. Causal chain—plate map → sleepwalking reconnaissance → thread guides → communal re-entry—holds without gaps; each night’s loop tightens possibility. Orientation is swift: “After the tide pools empty” anchors time, “wharf,” “shed roof,” “red canyon” place us within 60 words. One minor bobble: the smuggler’s apology is paid off only by atmosphere, not consequence, but it doesn’t rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory triangulation—salt-kelp air, orchid perfume, dust on lashes—grounds every shift from sea to stone. The loom-shed, tide-scent, and ankle-high thread turn environment into tactile interface: characters navigate by smell and toe-touch rather than sight. Canyon walls “like waves frozen mid-crash” externalize the town’s stilled dread and later release. Micro-setting (ceramic plate warmed by moonlight) functions as portable map and emotional thermometer, constraining route choices until it becomes the final window-frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore safe passage without repeating old disappearances—is signaled by “lovers vanish in the channels.” Escalation is accumulative: each dawn’s new thread extends the stitched lifeline, narrowing the option of total avoidance. The decisive tightening occurs when Ila nets a rockfall gap, forcing the town to confront rather than bypass the maze. Cost is visible—nightly exposure to dream-guided risk and the public relinquishing of secrecy—though individual physical stakes remain collective rather than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as covenant repair: reverence must be re-woven, not merely remembered. Subtext lives in gesture—carrying flowers instead of torches converts fear into fragrant vigil. The plate’s migrating door and the shifting footprints imply that sacred space is collaborative artwork, not fixed relic. Final image of wind blessing “every corridor” re-prices the old taboo without moralizing, leaving ambiguity between guidance and seduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hover stays tight to Ila’s perceptual warp: “paths on it shifted like threads seeking a needle.” Syntax loosens into incantatory cadence during sleepwalking passages, then tightens back for dawn logistics. No dialogue, so voice carries all status cues; dockhands’ deference is shown through their obedient return with dyed spools. The risk of lyric overwriting is flirted with but controlled—each figurative burst is anchored to textile or tidal motion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “prayer ribbons turn into warning flags” compresses social decay in one image. No scaffold loops; every sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay coherent within the weaving/tide nexus; mixed vehicle risk avoided. Occasional elevated diction—“covenant place,” “conceptual repricing”—is justified by Ila’s mythic task and does not leak into dockhand mouths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of textile craft with dream-archaeology feels fresh; the maze-as-loom solves the portal fantasy without tech or magic clichés. Orchid-colored thread as Ariadne’s stand-in re-genders and softens the heroic journey. Sleepwalking cartography literalizes “collective unconscious” without Jungian jargon. The only near-echo is “red canyon” western iconography, but carving nets into stone rather than riding through it flips the trope.</comment>
