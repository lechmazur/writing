<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The claustrophobic daughter’s embodied panic and micro-choices (three-breath/one-open exposure) track credibly; her final inhalation without scraping shows earned shift. Father’s quieter-stories credo stays consistent, but his own interiority is kept off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-way. No contradictory impulses in-scene for the father, capping just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence sample thickens pattern until gilded hush reweights the bunker-child’s world. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; inversion physics taught early and paid off at bell-snap closure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bedroom air “wide enough to live in” carries undeniable cost—she forfeits her father’s boxed safety. Persistent constraint: exposure method now governs every future breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trellis, porcelain doll, and scorched vines are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly constrain crossing choices. Micro-setting (the doll on wrist/blackened leaf) charges the final jar-opening image. Spatial choreography across rope web is coherent; no floating bodies. Just shy of 9 because valley traffic is heard but never re-enters as tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she inhale outside a box—tightens through measured exposure to unbounded air. Agency drives every escalation: she chooses three-breath intervals, decides to cup the gilded hush, then releases it at home. Cost is visible: lungs that once “scraped” now fill, but only after she accepts rope-hanging vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as architecture of breathable space—emerges from tasting jars and scorched vines, never sermonized. Final bedroom image reconfigures the bunker premise without moralizing. Subtext in father’s unspoken grief over sealed shelters lingers in “too many shelters built for curses.” Ambiguity remains: will tomorrow’s air stay wide? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a perceptual signature of measured containment—precise, carpentry-inflected diction (“measured shoulders,” “toolbox of invisible fruit”). Rhythm modulates with panic: short parataxis under ropes, longer cadence during tasting. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physical and legible. Compression (“world had turned into soil”) is taught by inversion rule and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences multi-task: “silence thickened around its porcelain body, gathering like light on glaze” advances atmosphere and tactile outcome. No synonym loops or template cadence; openings vary. One mixed metaphor—“sprout upward as if the world had turned into soil”—is justified by gravity inversion and does not blur causality. Clean proofing; pronouns track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Collectible silence tasted like pear or bitter tea feels non-obvious yet inevitable after setup. Inversion trellis as exposure therapy weaponizes a surreal device for psychological credence. Transformation test: swap silence for any generic fear and the arc collapses—proof of integration. Risk in marrying bunker realism to anti-gravity monks pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
