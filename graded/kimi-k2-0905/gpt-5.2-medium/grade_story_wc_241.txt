<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The daughter’s need to “count what he refused to” is embodied in every micro-choice—lighting the lantern, pulling call numbers, mounting the exhibit—so her inherited compulsion and her refusal to repeat it wrestle in scene. The final palm-empty moment with her father lands as earned renunciation because the scavenger hunt has forced her to rehearse his addiction without placing the bet. Interiority stays concrete (“lantern’s small circle,” “palms empty at last”) and never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the father’s voice (via seat scrawls) does more dramatic lifting than hers in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exhibit titled “Lucid Contradictions” crystallizes her stance—she will teach odds and cost together, foreclosing the path of pure prediction. Causal chain holds: because she follows each call number and seat clue, she accumulates the evidence that lets her reframe his legacy. The “DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE” constraint persists and shapes the final exhibit decision, so cost is visible. Lens is cleanly causal; no orientation debt; no plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed library’s wet-stone/clover smell, the mica-pane lantern’s amber grain, and the subway overpass timetable-box function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final exhibit tableau. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her from circulation desk → train → overpass → stacks → hospital without drift. Weather and scent evolve with emotional stakes; the “clover melancholy” reweights at closure when the four-leaf doodle reframes luck as weed-level ordinary. One notch below 9 only because the hospital room itself is sketched more thinly than the prior nodes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she will inherit or break the gambling lens—tightens when each seat scrawl forces her to test the contradiction in real time. The midpoint envelope (“DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE”) narrows options: she must create a teaching moment that exposes the cost instead of chasing the edge. Escalation is causal, not additive; every station she traverses raises the emotional ante by showing how seductive the odds language is. Cost is legible: she spends night, stamina, and filial loyalty to build the exhibit that renounces the bet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between prediction and responsibility: the seat-scrawls act as field data proving that knowing the odds does not free you from paying for them. The four-leaf clover doodle reweights the motif—luck is valuable only because it grows among weeds—delivering a conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext resides in the father’s silence once his palms are empty; the story trusts the image to argue that teaching cost alongside odds is the only ethical bet. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the lantern’s trembling flame lets the idea resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a mathematician’s precision (“tree of forks and odds,” “proofs that ended with questions”) yet stays sensuously embodied. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices ratios, scrawls, call numbers, and smells in the same breath. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens naturally under the overpass and relaxes in the library exhibit coda. The one-line paternal dialogue (“the best bet was learning to stop”) is spare and earned, avoiding ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long, clause-rich accumulations to the staccato “CERTAINTY IS A COIN WITH TWO HEADS,” mirroring the gamble between pattern and rupture. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each subway message advances knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“mica pane clouded but unbroken”), never clogging the high-pressure beats. One clause-borderline—“grief felt like clover again, green enough to hold sorrow”—is justified by the motif’s prior anchoring and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—using graffitied subway seats as field notes for a probability lecture on addiction—feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator’s filial dilemma. Risk is taken in structure: a scavenger hunt that could read as gimmick is grounded by the lantern’s physical continuity and the call-number chain of causality. The final exhibit converts private grief into public pedagogy without sentimental conversion, achieving freshness through synthesis rather than shock. Transformation test fails if you swap the clover motif or the lantern, proving integration.</comment>
