<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s tactile intimacy with the maze—folding maps by feel, tasting footstep rhythms—gives us a singular, embodied mind. The contradiction between her secrecy (hoarding the conduit) and her declared wish to protect crews fuels the climax; the moment she chooses to expose the secret to save the pinned stevedore, we see the cost in her “finger to lips” hush. Len remains a functional foil rather than a fully dimensional opponent, but the story needs no more at this length. The final refold of the map and coin-in-pocket registers a quiet, earned renunciation of her lone power—visible price, cleanly motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is ironclad: storm → radios dead → Len’s challenge → conduit test → crane brake slips → conduit redeployed to save worker → reroute signed. Each beat tightens the vice: failure costs Mara her job and maybe a life. Closure lands as Decisive Change plus lingering cost—she keeps the job but loses monopoly on her secret, a price shown in the final hush and coin pocketed. Orientation, lens, and escalation hold without wobble; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.</comment>

<comment>The container labyrinth is never described in bulk; instead we get “alleys that still breathed,” seams that “carry whispers like gutters,” and the slit where the brass key nests—details that matter because they enable the climax. Geomagnetic storm is more light-show than physics, but it freezes cranes and radios, so it passes the “affects choice” test. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track Mara from hatch to ARIES to conduit to SCORPIO/CANCER to LIBRA without drift. The brass key, map creases, and footstep timbre act as micro-settings that constrain every tactical move, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers > shouts or lose the maze and her job”—is declared before midpoint and repeatedly pressure-tested. The crane brake introduces an unplanned tightening that forces Mara to spend her hidden asset, turning a demo into life-or-death. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, but the final cost (secret exposed, power diffused) is legible and irreversible. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; the story meets the bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the value of quiet, attentive infrastructure over loud command-and-control systems. Subtext lives in gesture—Len’s warmed coin, Mara’s finger to the lips—never in exposition. Final image reframes the maze itself as a listening organism, a conceptual repricing that costs Mara her solitary priesthood. No moralizing, no thesis statement; resonance is earned through the saved stevedore and the hush that follows.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual grid: she “tastes” footfalls, “feels” folds in her pocket, hears “distant thunder and the slow, uneven pop of container straps.” Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, then compresses—“she ran toward the sound”—under pressure. No head-hopping; Len’s interior is only what Mara can infer from coin-play and footfall. Distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective (“whispers travel… like water in gutters”) and never clutters high-tempo beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new quiet order. One clause—“the little constellations catching the storm light”—is slightly ornamental, but it occurs in a lull and does not blunt the climax.</comment>

<comment>The acoustic conduit hidden inside a shipping maze, activated by a key with no lock, is a fresh, specific invention that feels inevitable once revealed. Footstep-as-face-recognition turns a familiar spy trope into dock-worker lore. Zodiac coin and geomagnetic storm could have read as gimmicks, but both serve the central whisper-vs-shout test rather than decoration. Synthesis of maritime logistics, geomagnetic disruption, and hush-based heroics yields a story that would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
