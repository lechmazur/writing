<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise, scientist-cold yet porous to wonder; the contradiction between “preprocess reality” and letting irregularities stand is dramatized in her micro-choice to keep the noisy dust maps. The final renunciation of telescope nights is felt, not declared, and the shared patch-job with Lupe shows relational shift with cost. Only the one-line “grief redistributed” flirts with label-speak, but it is instantly grounded in the dust overlay. Character arc is complete, specific, and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dust sheet adds density until the final pinned map reweights the greenhouse’s breathing and Mara’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pinned map crystallizes options for the students and for Mara, with the cost of lost nights legible in the same image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; every beat is either because/therefore or pattern-deepening. The leak-patch is the decisive physical act that pays off the spiral forewarning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop; broken panes, silt line, and seepage corner directly constrain the dust-mapping tactic and dictate the patch. Butterfly scales function as micro-setting that charges the final image when pinned to the door. Spatial choreography is immaculate—benches, table, crack, door tracked without drift. Weather remains present as slow decay, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore breathable order to the greenhouse and, by proxy, to Mara’s inner order. Escalation is textural: each dust sheet thickens the spiral, tightening stakes until the leak is located and patched. The tightening is visible, not declared; the price is the week of labor and the conceded telescope loss. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulate imagery: gradual change is read in shed scales and cooling stars alike. The final pinned map offers a non-literal answer—measurement itself becomes story, stripping drama yet adding humility. No moralizing; the reweighting is implicit in the students staring at the spiral. Subtext of scientist relinquishing absolute signal is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited is locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: neutron-star cooling metaphors, signal-to-noise vocabulary, tactile nullity of wing dust. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action; no head-hop. Register stays within her lexicon; “accretion stopped” is character-bound, not authorial flourish. Final paragraph modulates to a quieter cadence that mirrors earned humility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-true: “humidity curled the torn leaves as if each plant was exhaling a small apology” performs apology without purple. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pinned,” “scattered,” “tightened”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “stars cooled by listening” with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Flood-recovery greenhouse + butterfly-wing dust as airflow tracer is fresh synthesis; the neutron-star researcher applying accretion logic to air currents is non-obvious. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist, and it pays off. Slight familiarity of “scientist learns from nature” is transcended by granular physics metaphors and the final Charged Poise. Could edge higher with one more surprise beat, but already publishable tier.</comment>
