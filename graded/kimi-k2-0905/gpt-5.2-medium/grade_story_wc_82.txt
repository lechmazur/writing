<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s grief is embodied in the origami cranes and the lantern she re-tools; her choice to “leave part of herself in the light” is a costly, irreversible act that forecloses her old life. The interior contradiction—wanting Jalen back yet knowing the price is self-dispossession—plays out in the climactic folding scene. One decimal off 8.8 only because the brother’s laughter is named, not shown, so the emotional baseline is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: missing shadow → lantern recorder → basilica bargain → self-splitting → crane-bird that re-casts shadows. The “stair that descends while ascending” is taught early, paid off in the return, anchoring the surreal geometry. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s partial self-objectification into paper birds is an irreversible, visible cost that reweights every prior lantern image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating tea garden, mirrored priests, and glass basilica are sketched with scent and prismatic light, but the micro-setting is the lantern itself—its brass throat, gem lens, and final projection—whose evolving states constrain every tactical choice. The basilica’s spinning isle and gravity-defying stair are not decorative; they gate entry and later echo Mira’s disorientation. Environment directly shapes the climax: the crystal dais focuses the dream and literally splits her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Jalen’s shadow—tightens when the priests demand “part of herself.” The single meaningful escalation is the self-splitting: it narrows options from “save brother” to “save brother by diminishing self,” a trade-off that charges every subsequent beat. Cost is legible on-page: flame-Mira polishes the gem while paper-Mira is folded away, a permanent reduction of agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade><comment>Theme of grief as material labor—folding, polishing, recording—emerges through action, never thesis. The cranes shift from dead paper to living silhouettes, reconfiguring loss as communal resource without moralizing. Final image of new lanterns glowing “with the ache she folded into them” offers a non-literal answer: pain can be transmuted but never returned intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s tactile attention: gem weight against fingertips, vertigo on the impossible stair. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short folds at the climax, mirroring the paper creases. No head-hop; even priests remain faceless mirrors, preserving POV modesty. One hairline slip: “luminous torment in sound” edges toward writerly abstraction, briefly lifting out of Mira’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided—light bites, shadows crawl, paper accepts creases, all consistent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythmic repetition of “lanterns shaped like cranes” is earned callback, not template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadow-detachment and dream-recording feel inevitable yet fresh because the mechanics are rooted in lantern-craft and gem-polishing—occupational specifics not generic magic. The “descends while ascending” stair is a surreal spatial risk that pays off narratively and thematically. Synthesis of Japanese paper-folding, Victorian lantern glass, and cloud-basilica creates a singular cultural alloy that would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
