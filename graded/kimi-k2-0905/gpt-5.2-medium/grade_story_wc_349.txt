<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vendor’s erased identity and hunger for a first word give a coherent spine; interiority is lyrical but stays concrete (“the hollow in me”). Micro-choice—cutting absence with the stylus—earns the self-naming, yet the emotional contradiction under pressure is more asserted than embodied, keeping the arc vivid but not fully visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parole incision rewrites the teller into being, cost legible in the single new page and the address left behind. Causal chain—moonlight map → count gaps → cut doorway—holds without gaps; orientation anchors inside 120 words. One minor scaffold: “I counted… I counted…” loop dulls propulsion yet never touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard, drifting shelves, and cloud sea are sensuously filtered through vendor priorities; the table over open sky literally forces the incision choice. Micro-setting (stylus, bottle, docket) constrains tactics and reappears in the charged final address. Selective detail keeps momentum; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—win a self-beginning—tightens when counting silence becomes the only path to parole; refusal to miscount forecloses retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each measured gap narrows future options until the cut risks permanent blankness. Cost is visible in the trembling fragments and the page that now speaks the vendor into existence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-as-creation emerges through action, not statement; final image of cart-wheel-on-glass reprises the opening with reweighted meaning. Subtext in Mira’s cloud-breaking smile lets reader feel the parole’s cruelty and mercy simultaneously. No moralizing—ambiguity lingers about whether any story truly escapes the orchard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a hushed, moon-lit cadence; perceptual signature notices blanks, catalog numbers, photons. Lyric compression (“speech broken into photons”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; register stays within vendor’s plausible lexicon even under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; high information density without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—moonlight as map, silence as countable—never muddling causality. One tiny loop of “I counted” repeats but does not stall the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating glass library that grows books like fruit, parole by excising absence, and moonlight as witness feel inevitable yet fresh. Conceptual risk—quantifying silence to birth identity—pays off in a single image that could not swap into another tale. Synthesis fuses setting, stakes, and theme without ornamental quirk.</comment>
