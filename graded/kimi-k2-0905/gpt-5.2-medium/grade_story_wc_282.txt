<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mina’s sensory vocation and her mother’s fossil gift braid into a single, embodied motive: to let the caves speak rather than to speak for them. The contradiction—scientist vs. listener—plays out in micro-choices: she loosens the fossil instead of clutching it, names chambers aloud instead of cataloguing silently. The final renunciation—leaving the fossil in the alien handprints—costs her the last talisman of home, earned by every prior heat-reading. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “longing” is pinned to limestone temperature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s emotional archive is redefined as inter-species, not human, and Mina forfeits her transitional object to certify that shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each heat-flare layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: tide surge → sealed exit → fossil guidance → relinquishment. Cost is legible in the last line—she sings the cave its own name, now voiceless herself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is not backdrop but pressure system: tide surge seals the exit, limestone temperature dictates direction, moonlit vent offers sole escape. Shell-fossil tunnel and jointed handprints are micro-settings that force the recognition of non-human occupancy. The elm leaf fossil functions as portable setting-as-tool, constraining the final choice when she slots it beside the alien prints. Sensory hierarchy is vocation-true—temperature before sight, salt before color.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the unknown without colonizing it—tightens when the tide blocks retreat and the fossil demands agency. One meaningful deepening: the warmth she reads is not human emotion but alien comfort markers, flipping her cartographic ethic. Escalation is textural: each heat-flare adds density until relinquishment is the only unmapped act left. Cost is the fossil itself, surrendered to certify the new covenant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as anti-colonial cartography: maps should listen, not own. Subtext resides in the fossil’s migration—from maternal gift to inter-species treaty—without moralizing. Final image reweights “transitional object” from human comfort to cross-species handshake. Ambiguity lingers: the cave may never “speak” back, but Mina’s forfeiture makes that silence legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mina’s perceptual signature—temperature as syntax, fossil as compass. No head-hopping; even alien warmth is filtered through her palm. Rhythm swells from clipped survey notes to lyric final line, mirroring shift from data to song. Diction remains within her professional lexicon until the sung name breaks pattern, taught and earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “The cave was an enormous sleeping body” fuses metaphor, stakes, and stakes-of-knowing in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances map, emotion, or world-rule. Figurative layer is spare—only two sustained metaphors (sleeping body, compass needle) and both pay off. Final line’s monosyllabic lift (“began to sing the cave its own name”) gives cadence release without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips classic “last human” trope into post-human collaboration; the hibernators are irrelevant, the alien archive everything. Heat-mapping emotion as cartographic method is fresh, rigorously followed, and charged with conceptual cost. Fossil-as-bilateral-transitional-object synthesizes geology, grief, and diplomacy in one handled artifact. Risk—letting the map erase the mapper—pays off in the relinquishment beat.</comment>
