<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric yet concrete—"cautious exuberance" recurs as embodied pulse. The swallowed sentences motif externalizes fear without therapy-speak. Final micro-choice—mailing the apology—pays off the sister-name reveal with visible cost: he already risked speech. Flaw: no second character on page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the second letter is emptied of verdict because he has rewritten the stakes himself. Causal chain—watch reversals → cipher → library → apology—tightens once and lands. Cost is legible in the glowing mist on the window: the library’s price is perpetual exposure of the once-silent voice. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Attic, canal district, and library are sketched with selective synesthesia—"shelved with bottled dawn." The watch functions as micro-setting: its 13-minute reversals physically choreograph every step. Final image—glowing mist on attic window—re-embodies the library inside his lived space. No spatial drift; geography tracks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover swallowed sentences—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: cipher decodes into his own name, collapsing accuser and accused. Price is the irrevocable mailing of the apology; the second letter’s blankness confirms the option foreclosed. Escalation is accumulative/textural—delay pulses intensify density until silence is broken.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—voice stolen by self, not villain—emerges only when the cipher names him. Subtext of postal refusal (unsent letter) becomes literal act of mailing. Final line reweights "fateful letter" into mirror: the library is the self that dared. No moralizing; resonance lingers in glowing mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains veiled yet precise: "the place listening" keeps POV inside his sensorium. Syntax elongates/shortens with watch reversals, teaching rhythm early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every glow and lag through his breath-rate. Register stays consistent—archaic tinge without pastiche.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: "mist rose, carrying a faint radiance" advances both atmosphere and beacon. No scaffold loops; each clause adds new causal or sensory data. Figurative layer—"bottled dawn"—is sparse, pattern-taught, and paid off. One hairline slip: "cyclically reversed every thirteen minutes" could trim "cyclically."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—library of unspoken words accessed via dishonest watch-time—is fresh yet inevitable. Cipher decoded by propagation delay turns physics into poetics. Risk: entire plot hinges on a gimmick, but gimmick is internalized as self-accusation. Transformation complete: confidence man’s cheat becomes instrument of honesty.</comment>
