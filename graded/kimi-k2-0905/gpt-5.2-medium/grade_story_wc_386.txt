<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and ethic (“salvage something pure”) drive every beat; her careful truth-weaving is dramatized in the globe-alignment and dream-tracking, not merely labeled. Interiority stays concrete—she warms the glass, listens to ghosts as “images pressed against her thoughts”—and the final renunciation (setting the globe in the alcove) costs her the child’s lingering presence, a price felt on the page. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite met, but motive, micro-choice, and embodied emotion remain coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: globe → Fen’s dream-theft → shrine lens → crowd exposure. Orientation is secured by line 20; the melted globe’s origin and Mara's hunt logic are anchored early. Closure lands as Decisive Change—Fen taken, globe relocated, child’s silence paid—under a stable Causal lens. Cost is visible (“the child’s ghost crowded close… only silence remained”), nudging the score to high band, though the final beat could sharpen the personal price to Mara.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glacier shrine is no backdrop: the ice lens literally enables the climactic vision; candle-tinted blue starlight colors every beat. Sensory selection tracks Mara’s diver bias—temperature, pressure, silt—while the shrine’s architecture (alcoves, altar-stone) guides her final placement of the globe. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies, distances, and object states track without drift. Environment constrains the pivotal choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“salvage purity” versus Fen’s dream-theft—tightens when Mara realizes the globe’s water was boiled to thin ghosts, forcing her to risk public accusation. One meaningful escalation: the shared-dream trap that exposes Fen; no reversal, but options narrow and a visible price (child’s silence) is paid. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence only complicates. Cost is legible, though a sharper personal stake for Mara at the end would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between commodified memory and unpaid remembrance; no character states it aloud. The melted globe’s return as a free window reweights “purity” from intactness to shared vulnerability. Final image—imagined snow inside distorted glass—offers a non-literal answer: value lies in rescued imperfection, not saleable illusion. Subtext operates through gesture (placing globe in alcove) and silence of the vanished child.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s diver perception: “she aligned distortions the way she aligned testimonies.” Diction remains within her professional lexicon; syntax lengthens under contemplative pressure, then compresses during the pier confrontation. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully. Distinctive cadence and metaphoric control (“candles borrowed starlight”) create a memorable texture without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, motive, world-rule—without scaffold: “glass does not slump into itself in seawater unless…” marries technical observation to moral indictment. Rhythm varies from long accumulative clauses to short pulses under pressure. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise. A single filter-verb cluster (“she saw… she saw…”) during the lens vision is minor enough to leave high-band intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing Arctic wreck-diving with dream-harvesting smugglers feels fresh, yet every fantastical element grows from the mundane act of melting a child’s souvenir. The “window of connection” concept is fully embodied in ice lens + shared dreams, not tacked on. Risky structure—lyric shards around a single object—pays off when the distorted globe becomes a free shrine window. Specificity of dive detail and ghost economy prevents this from reading like prompt salad.</comment>
