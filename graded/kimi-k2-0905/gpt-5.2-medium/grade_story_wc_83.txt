<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Survivor’s trauma-driven refusal to look away powers every beat; embodied grief in cracked glass & geode handling keeps interiority concrete. Micro-choices—manual thruster bursts, feeding the pool into the net—show hierarchy of values: memory > safety > mercy. Cost is felt when he seizes the “hinge” of a live branch he cannot enter; renunciation lands clean. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; contradiction between vengeance and mercy stays tacit and active.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: overload → 12-minute battery clock → perturbation readings → thruster steering → capture of mercy-pause → upload with geode signature. Closure is a Decisive Change: future drones inherit the pause; conceptual cost—he weaponizes his own wound—is legible in “forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props; breakers’ click pays off the clock set-up. Lens stays causal throughout; no retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating observatory is no postcard: groaning balloon skin, cracked glass, cooling relays—each item constrains action or signals time. Ash-colored sea and bruise-clouds externalize internal state without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of cracked waveguide & hand-built coil turns geode from memento into calibration tool that alters tactics. Spatial choreography clean: knees, workbench, screen, thruster controls track throughout; environment reacts to perturbation pulses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he hijack the slack that killed her?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one continuous tightening: 12-minute power window narrows to breaker click; each thruster burst costs irreplaceable gas; final upload forecloses vengeance path. No coincidence; every intensification is self-created via probe pulses & steering. Cost visible: geode’s faint ring marks crossing into live branch he cannot enter; mercy extracted from own wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: probabilistic slack in killing machines can be seized as mercy, but only by weaponizing personal trauma. No explicit thesis; final image reweights earlier “unfiltered awakening” from curse to reluctant gift. Ambiguity lingers—future drones may still kill, yet now carry his grief—avoiding tidy moral. Subtext in geode: wedding planet split open becomes lens that refracts possibility, not symbol pasted on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature: engineer’s precision fused with widower’s hallucinatory clarity. Compression taught early (“intangibly tangible”) and paid off at hinge moment. Syntax mirrors pressure: long clause-stack sentences under calm analysis, fragment-like bursts during thruster firing. No head-hopping; diction stays within graduate-ruins lexicon; rhythmic control heightens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density: one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and causal work. Metaphors (“smoke that still weighs your palm”) stay coherent and grounded. Minor loop risk in “perturbation” repetitions but each use carries new causal payload; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns; paragraph cuts tight—none removable without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drone warfare, grief, and quantum-tinged engineering into fresh synthesis; geode-as-calibration-tool is specific invention. Risk of concept-overload is embraced and survived through embodied stakes. Transformation test fails if bride or observatory swapped—details are irreplaceable. Final reconfiguration—mercy injected into kill-chain—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Bold structural compression (single 12-minute window) heightens rather than gimmicks.</comment>
