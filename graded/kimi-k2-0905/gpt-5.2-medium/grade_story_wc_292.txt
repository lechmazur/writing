<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory mix of archival caution and ancestor-loyalty is embodied in the tremor she feels when the copper nail “rings” on Sato’s desk; the micro-choice to confront him with the relic crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The final beat—uploading the correction while dread drains into the sea—earns a credible renunciation of her earlier need for institutional approval, paying a visible social cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into diagnostic labels. Only the off-stage wartime backstory keeps this from full 9-band integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: shifted jet stream → exposed journals → decoded stanzas → cemetery coffin → copper key → annex reveal → archival correction, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the maritime registry can now be amended, reversing Elias’s exile with on-page conceptual cost—the Archive’s authority is openly challenged. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the blank square on the antique chart anchors time, place, and motive. No lens ambiguity; the final image of “clean lines across a sky that… had room for Elias Kline’s name” reweights memory itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Weather station, radar dome, dehumidified cabinet, and lichened cliff cemetery are filtered through Mara’s cartographer gaze—every detail either advances decoding or constrains movement. The copper nail’s green patina and coffin-seam slot provide micro-setting that literally unlocks the annex, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to taste of rust and the wind’s wet palm during the climax, mirroring her spongey dread without overt symbolism. Only the wartime meteorologist’s physical absence prevents full 9-band object-to-choice constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Elias’s name—faces escalating institutional resistance: Sato’s initial evasion, the locked annex, and the unfiled reversal clause. The midpoint tightening occurs when Mara overlays quatrains onto the antique chart, foreclosing the possibility that Elias was merely cowardly; the copper nail later forces a public confrontation that risks her professional credibility. Cost is legible: she jeopardizes her position at the Hydrographic Archive by submitting a formal correction that contradicts official record. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence exposes the journals but every subsequent turn is driven by her decoding choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory as weather, reversible only when someone brave enough to be doubted is finally believed—emerges through the jet-stream metaphor and the unfiling of the reversal order; no character sermonizes. Subtext resides in the copper nail’s ring: metal remembering its purpose parallels the archive’s obligation to remember. The final image of instruments drawing “clean lines across a sky that… had room for Elias Kline’s name” reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in whether the institution will accept her correction, keeping the theme complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—coastlines, isobars, and archival marginalia color every observation. Syntax lengthens during decoding, then fractures into short clauses under the cemetery’s “spongey dread,” mirroring her pulse. No head-hopping; Sato’s interior remains opaque, read only through gesture and the nail’s ringing. The diction never drifts into meteorological jargon without Mara’s explanatory filter, keeping voice coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid catalogues of salt-stiff pages to staccato revelations (“the lock yielded”), propelling the beat. Figurative language is sparse but precise: the station “exhales,” dread is “spongey,” metaphors never layered to clutter. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line advances either map-overlay logic or atmospheric pressure. The final clause—“a sky that, at last, had room for Elias Kline’s name”—lands with rhythmic cadence that closes the sonic pattern opened in the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-shifted coastlines, coded shipwreck journals, and a bureaucratic reversal-of-exile mechanism feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope templates are visible. The copper nail as both coffin hinge and biometric key transforms a gothic relic into archival technology without contrivance. Risk is taken in embedding the entire climax in document authentication rather than physical danger, yet the emotional stakes remain high. The synthesis of meteorology, cartography, and posthumous justice is specific to this voice and cannot be relocated unchanged.</comment>
