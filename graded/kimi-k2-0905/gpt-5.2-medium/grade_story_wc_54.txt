<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s “functionally creative” trait is shown, not told: she turns cracked tile into drainage algebra, rigs gutters to prime a pump, reads people-flow as hydraulic logic. Interiority stays concrete and occupational—she weighs flow rates, not feelings—so when her hands shake from cold the moment lands harder. The final renunciation (approving demolition is no longer imaginable) is earned because every micro-choice has tied her identity to resurrecting the maze. Only the stoic mask feels asserted rather than revealed, keeping her just shy of full contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s beacon rewrites the demolition brief into an open invitation, cost paid by Lina’s off-the-books labor and the authority’s lost control. Causal chain holds—sextant → architect letters → redirect flow → antenna—each because/therefore linkage tightening options until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal”) and the lens (Causal) is unambiguous at exit. No teleporting props or retro-fitted knowledge; the broken sextant’s date is set-up, not patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass concourse filmed with dust and confetti, dry fountain smelling of cold metal, skylight frames braiding shadows—each tactile detail is filtered through Lina’s civil-engineer gaze and either enables or records her retrofit. The terminal itself functions as tool: roof gutters become intake, tile map becomes schematic, balcony arc becomes sextant’s missing curve. Environment constrains every move—she wedges carnival signposts as downspouts, reroutes cistern to cool transmitter—so the final beacon is inseparable from the place’s physical logic. One hairline slip: “constellation” reflection inside windows is pretty but not grounded in a measurable surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—demolition vs resurrection—signals early and tightens once: when Lina primes the pump she crosses the bureaucratic line, foreclosing the easy report. Pressure escalates through because/therefore engineering obstacles (clogged drain → signpost gutter → turbine cough), each solved with visible stamina cost. No antagonist needed; the building’s entropy is sufficient, and coincidence is absent. The price—personal overtime, possible career reprimand—is legible but could be sharper on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the parallel between human circulation and water flow; the story never lectures, letting the tile map of blank oceans and the explorer’s grief letters do the talking. The sextant’s broken arc re-weights from relic to blueprint, implying departure is only half the equation—returning with redirected hope completes it. Final line “hope is conserved when it is redirected” risks echoing the prompt, but lands as Lina’s own engineering law, not authorial moral. Ambiguity remains: the beacon may summon squatters, poets, or no one—yet the cost of sending it is already paid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lina’s perceptual grid: she reads load paths, smells grease, measures angles with a pencil tip. Syntax mirrors her cadence—short instrumental clauses when she works, longer reflective stretches when circuits close. No head-hopping; the explorer’s grief is delivered via found letters, not omniscient intrusion. Occasional elevated diction (“equations drawn in steel and paint”) momentarily lifts above her intern register but reads as her private exhilaration, not narrator inflation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “first trickle sounded like a small animal returning to a burrow” does double sensory duty without overwriting. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances flow, light, or insight. Filter verbs are scarce and purposeful (“she realized” is earned after physical discovery). One micro-scaffold: “she rerouted…she redirected” in adjacent clauses, but the repetition enacts the iterative tuning she performs, so it reads intentional rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of civil-engineer problem-solving with grief-cartography feels fresh: a demolition survey becomes covert resurrection via hydraulics. Sextant-as-missing-baluster and people-as-water are not gimmicks but organic discoveries that reconfigure the premise. Risk is taken with the quiet ending—no crowd arrives, no sirens—yet the conceptual cost (authority lost, intern self-reassigned) is undeniable. Only the carnival confetti feels like borrowed local color; everything else is particular to this terminal, this voice.</comment>
