<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sera’s contradictory drives—incendiary protector vs. tender archivist—are alive in every beat: she copies the reel instead of torching it, feeling the blister-memory “like magma.” The final choice to broadcast rather than burn is earned by the chain of artistic clues that force her to trade secrecy for exposure; the cost is the return of her public name, the very thing she tried to erase. Interiority stays concrete (“her chest roared”) and avoids label-speak even at peak heat. Only the off-stage Miko keeps this from a perfect 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each artwork points → next clue → spiral alignment → drawer opens → reel copied → tower broadcast, every step shrinking her options. Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable social cost: she forfeits anonymity forever. Orientation is locked in the first 40 words (who=Sera, where=ash flats, when=after arsons). No teleporting props; the tapestry fragment is the literal key that slots into the tar-slashed tower image, paying off the winter-roof promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: warm air breathing from the ridge seam literally guides her body inside; obsidian steps force cautious descent that mirrors her slowing heartbeat. The canvas-on-frame in the central chamber functions as micro-setting—she scrapes it with the fragment, so the object’s texture alters the revelation pace. Ash flats, copper bird, clay hand mosaic—all filter through her pattern-seeking gaze, never tourist catalog. Final image of “volcano turned outward” reuses the geothermal motif to rewire her destructive gift into illumination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep promise vs. keep self hidden—tightens with each artwork that drags her toward public exposure. The tar-slashed self-portrait is the key pressure spike: it fuses her face to Miko’s, making anonymity impossible. Cost is legible: she trades the erasure she once performed with fire for the irreversible broadcast that will resurrect her hunted name. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no reversal is needed because the escalation is causal and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: archives are libraries that outlived fires, so the true arson must target blindness, not paper. The reel of forced confessions reframes her earlier blazes as mere prelude; the final image of “lighting the way home” reweights fire from destruction to beacon. No moralizing line tells us; the thematic turn is the action of copying and transmitting rather than igniting. Ambiguity lingers: she will still be called arsonist, but now for a fire that can’t be touched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Sera’s perceptual signature: numbers “feel in her ribs,” tar grin is “ruined,” breath is “older than any city.” Syntax lengthens during analytic mapping, then fractures into magma/ash diction under final stress. No head-hopping; Miko’s voice arrives only via recorded reel, maintaining distance. Compression like “threadbare as old breath” is taught early and pays off when she uses the cloth as sandpaper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control is tight: “volcano turned outward” lands once, at closure, where it reconfigures the metaphoric ledger. No mixed metaphors; ash, fire, breath, and obsidian form a coherent elemental palette. Rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses during descent, then snaps to short beats for the drawer reveal, mirroring pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lending-library-arsonist who redeems herself by *not* burning the archive is a fresh inversion; the artistic breadcrumb trail replaces the usual rebel-tech trope. Specificity—old lending-card number on the reel—makes the payoff inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken: the love story is entirely off-page, yet the emotional charge holds because the artifacts *are* the love letters. Could push higher if the societal lie were more than a named abstraction, but within word count the concept feels singular.</comment>
