<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “reactively visionary” trait is dramatized through on-the-spot map revisions and the staged three-evening assemblies; the contradictory pull between archival duty and communal healing is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays concrete (“turned the valve in her palm and realized…”). The final choice—to postpone the trumpet’s sounding until the town can exhale together—carries visible social cost (angry shutters, shaken Ilven) and is earned by the spaced intervals she earlier enforced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the first note becomes an invitation, not a command, re-weighting the meaning of both sound and silence; cost is legible in Ilven’s trembling hand and the town’s gathered anger. Causal chain holds: valve → spaced confessions → communal hearing → altered social contract. Orientation is clean within 60 words; mosaic of three shards is taught early and lands under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<comment>Harbor’s wet salt, crushed lime, and rain-bright stones are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; the corroded trumpet valve acts as micro-setting that ultimately constrains the final sounding. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from quay to bell tower. Weather (after rain) is used to affect footing and scent, never mere backdrop. One proper-noun anchor—“ivory harbor”—is reused efficiently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the town face its navigated absences—tightens when Mara risks communal anger by staging delayed hearings; each interval forecloses the easy comfort of a swift ceremonial trumpet blast. Escalation is Accumulative: blank ledger pages and torn notebook gaps accumulate pressure until the final note reconfigures silence itself as communal resource. Cost is visible in slammed shutters and Ilven’s shaking hand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—absence as livable space—emerges through brass corrosion, torn pages, and staged silence rather than exposition. Subtext operates in gesture: Ilven’s inability to fit the valve immediately signals residual guilt. Final image reweights the premise: an invitation, not decree, proving silence can be a corridor of doubt rather than erasure. No moralizing statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mara; perceptual signature is salted paper and tide tables. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action (“She asked Sorrel to wait”). No head-hopping; Ilven’s interior is accessed only through observable tremor. Distinct maritime lexicon—“berths stayed empty,” “scrape of oars”—remains within Mara’s archival idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“then fourteen, then twenty-one”) mirrors tidal spacing; no template cadence. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—sound as reef, ledger as chart. One paraphrase loop spotted (“spaced their meetings so his memory could thaw in layers” echoes prior thaw metaphor) but does not touch closure. High information density; each sentence advances map, motive, or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-exile archive as navigational science of missingness. Trumpet valve transformed from heraldic cliché into silence-enabling key; spaced-interval method turns typical healing ritual into measurable tidal cadence. Conceptual risk—story climaxes with an acoustic redefinition rather than physical battle—pays off by reconfiguring obedience itself. Specificity of “navigated absences” could not survive name-or-place swap.</comment>
