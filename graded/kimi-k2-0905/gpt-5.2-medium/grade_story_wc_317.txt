<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—safeguarding messy innovation—drives every beat; the orthogonal method literalizes her vocation. Interiority is concrete (“my hands hovered as if the seed could hear”) and her refusal to sell out costs her the commercial bloom, a visible price. The OrthoGen woman is more foil than crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin, capping the arc just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: seed arrival → investigation → trap room → seed slowed → contract refused, each beat a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses market co-option at the price of future scrutiny. Orientation lands by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold—two “because I…” clauses back-to-back—barely dulls momentum.</comment>

<comment>The brookside haven, humidity valves, and scent filters physically constrain the final choice; the shed’s air-vent switch is the decisive lever. Weather residue (“storm-born silence”) permeates acoustics and timing. Spatial tracking holds across warehouse, brook, mail-drop, and shed. Environment is not just mood but mechanism, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the sanctuary un-corporatized—tightens when the seed’s bloom threatens publicity. The midpoint reversal: she weaponizes the germination room into a test that exposes OrthoGen’s intent, narrowing her options to resist or capitulate. Cost is legible: she accepts slower growth and future risk to protect the space. One clear escalation beat meets the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship over extraction emerges through the living puzzle; no character sermonizes. The final rule—“puzzles should open minds, not markets”—is earned by the trap-room demonstration, not asserted. Corpse-flower rarity and clove-rot scent reweight to imply consent ethics without stating them. Ambiguity remains: will the bloom still draw crowds? That tension lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is tactile and idiosyncratic: “locks click louder than a confession,” “doors that did not lock behind corporate smiles.” Syntax tightens under pressure—single-clause bursts during the switch reveal. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. One register lift—“orthogonal approaches”—reads slightly academic for late-night vernacular, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor). One paraphrase loop—“because I am notably receptive, I noticed…”—restates the obvious. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final image (“storm-born silence… like a vow”) lands cleanly, recharging the opening weather note. Minor loop prevents 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Biotech-vs-artisan premise is familiar, but the escape-room-as-germination-lab twist feels fresh and inevitable. The orthogonal detective method literalizes the protagonist’s profession rather than grafting a gimmick. Specific detail—wax seal matching an old incubator logo—grounds the conflict in lived history. Risk is present but safe; no formal or tonal daring pushes it into the 9+ stratum.</comment>
