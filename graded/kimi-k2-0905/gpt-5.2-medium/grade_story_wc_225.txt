<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-driven compulsion to “move differently” is embodied in every micro-gesture; the fidgeting, tapestry tracing, and final refusal to claim heroism all spring from the same self-reproach. The interior contradiction—needing to restart time yet refusing to play savior—peaks when she offers the draw to her past self in the mirrored gate, a choice foreshadowed by her earlier cruelty to the prince. Cost is legible: she exits anonymously, satchel lighter of praise but heavier of earned quiet. The only bar to 9.0 is a slight externalization of regret in “memory of the prince's last command” rather than a present-tide of shame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the labyrinth dims, seconds release, and Mara’s anonymity is the felt price. Causal chain holds—each tapestry-decoded move forces a corresponding turn in the platinum maze; the final “return” is the logical culmination of the sequence. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity; the story teaches its accumulative pattern early and pays it off in the mirrored gate image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen village is not backdrop but antagonist: suspended ale, pinned snowflakes, and half-chimed bell constrain every step. The tapestry’s frayed border functions as micro-setting, its fibers “lifted like question marks” guiding Mara’s fingers and later her moral pivot. Platinum lines literally hum with stolen seconds, a sensory detail that charges the final image when they dim. Environment, body, and tool intersect at the mirrored gate to force the draw-offer; without these tactile anchors the ending would collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart time without repeating imperial cruelty—tightens when each shortcut-temptation in the maze equates to the prince’s “winning line.” The meaningful turn comes at the mirrored gate: sacrificing personal redemption (hero recognition) to preserve townsfolk’s unbroken lives. Cost is on-page: she forfeits acclaim and accepts perpetual self-exile. Pressure escalates via accretive sensory compression—“woven hush tightened… thoughts seemed wrapped in cloth”—until the draw word releases both time and her lungs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chess principle that a draw can be ethical victory; the tapestry’s border rewrites tactics as ethics. Subtext resides in gesture: pressing the cloth to the gate is both surrender and checkmate against her former self. Final image—anonymous bow, “learning to move differently”—reweights the opening exile into quiet self-pardon without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: Brinewick will never know, and that unknowing is her sentence and salvation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: “fidgets productively,” “sharp, praised, and careless” in the mirror. Syntax mirrors chess logic—colon-like pauses after sensory clauses—then fractures under pressure (“pressure… thoughts seemed wrapped in cloth”). No head-hopping; the innkeeper’s single line is reported speech filtered through her refusal to claim credit. Voice modulates from court-sharp to penitential hush without register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “snowflakes hovered like pinned notes” does double sensory-symbolic work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances maze, tapestry, or interior calculus. Figurative language peaks at the mirrored gate then steps aside for the release image, avoiding clutter at closure. One near-purple phrase—“bright maze of metal lines that hummed with the town's captured seconds”—earns its place by becoming the literal timer she must unlock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time tales are common; stitching the curse to a chess tutor’s ethical re-education through tapestry notation feels inevitable yet fresh. The platinum labyrinth literalizes temporal strategy boards, transforming abstract guilt into physical steps. Risk is taken in refusing heroic triumph—an anti-climactic draw that nonetheless satisfies because the story taught us draws can be victories. Transformation test passes: swap chess for any other game and the entire symbolic scaffolding collapses.</comment>
