<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sera’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven atonement vs. tactical patience—are dramatized in the tremor she feels when the terrace “tilts,” embodying cost. Micro-choices (arriving early, selecting the ruin, surrendering the corridor map) align with her need for redemption and alter the room’s chemistry. The final vow exchange crystallizes her hierarchy of values: ritual labor over absolution. Burn-scar reveal and clipboard weight give embodied continuity; no head-hopping or label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Sera brings the ritual, therefore the commanders must burn relics, therefore a treaty becomes thinkable. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses personal absolution and accepts daily labor, cost legible in “daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for.” One tightening beat suffices; no plot amnesia. Slight cap at 8.7 because the treaty’s enforcement mechanism remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Terrace, bowl, smoke, and shifting-star mosaics are woven through action, not backdrop: the celestial line literally positions the parties, the bowl forces the sacrifice. Micro-setting (ebony clipboard, reed candles) constrains gesture and timing. Sensory hierarchy follows Sera’s negotiator eye—she notices salt dust, medal click, candle flicker—selective, urgent. Final ash drift reconfigures the earlier smoke image, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ritual compel two war criminals to foreclose future atrocities—signaled in paragraph 5. Pressure tightens when each commander must produce an irreversible token; refusal would publicly collapse the truce. Sera’s agency is the design and enforcement of the ritual; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: the burned items and her acceptance of endless labor narrow her own options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: peace as imperfect, daily penance rather than absolution. Subtext lives in gesture—shaking fingers, metallic click, lowered bronze masks—never sermon. Final line’s “not forgiveness, only the daily labor” offers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ash/smoke recurrence reweights the opening image, resonance earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Sera’s perceptual filter: “terrace tilted as if the sky itself judged her” keeps psychic distance tight. Syntax lengthens under emotional load then snaps short at vows, rhythmic control mirroring tension. No head-hopping; envoys’ interiors remain opaque, read through Sera’s interpretation. Diction—“operatively gentle,” “flawed beauty”—is hers, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: advance story, deepen atmosphere, reveal character. No paraphrase loops; each image fresh. Figurative density peaks at the burn yet remains coherent—ash “threw flawed beauty onto their faces,” marrying theme and visual. Minor scaffold: two adjectival stacks (“violet air,” “bronze masks”) but none obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar truce ritual is retooled through Sera’s personal guilt map and the astronomical anchor, producing specificity. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic neutral site. Risk taken: climax is collective vow, not shoot-out; coherence retained. Reed-candle girl as living messenger freshens standard prisoner-exchange trope.</comment>
