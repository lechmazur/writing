<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s promotion to foreman and the collective “we” ringing the bell give visible micro-choices, but interior contradiction is reported (“our fear…fell away”) rather than dramatized in scene. Serren’s altruism is shown through action, yet no character carries a simultaneous opposing impulse that complicates the final ascent. The arc of strangers-become-family is credible, but the cost of that transformation is asserted, not embodied in a single POV beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine—chalk messages → bell → relay rebuild → nebula window—holds cleanly, and the grave-pod recording supplies a decisive change that reweights Serren’s trustworthiness. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the living must keep chalk-and-bell vigil for future strays, a price stated on-page. One minor scaffold: “we understood then” compresses the emotional turn instead of letting us watch the shift beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Floating stone arches and pollen-dulled brass bell are tactile, plot-relevant, and reappear at the climax; the orchard’s bitter-moon sap directly constrains which fruit can be eaten, shaping survival tactics. Spatial choreography stays coherent as crews move under the levitating arch to cable the relay. The world never exposition-dumps; rules emerge through action and Serren’s guided warnings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape to the nebula—tightens when the relay well demands cooperative labor, turning passive refugees into active builders. A visible price is paid: days of thorn-scratched labor and the bell’s relocation, shown on-page. Escalation is linear rather than multi-turn, but the single deepening (ghost’s grave reveals past sacrifice) meaningfully reweights the effort required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Family-as-practice emerges through the chalk chain that outlives bloodlines; the final promise to leave dawn messages for the next strays crystallizes the theme without sermon. The butterfly garden’s milkweed and bell accrue resonance as tools of hospitality rather than symbols bolted on. No character articulates a thesis; meaning stays rooted in the communal act of rebuilding and the ghost’s earlier sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>First-person plural maintains stable distance and a collective perceptual signature: “we thought,” “we reexamined,” never slipping into individual head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under wonder and contracts during thorn-scratched labor, mirroring group fatigue. The lyric register (“star-scented window”) is consistent with the orchard-world’s mythic tone and taught early enough to feel earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “valleys stitched with pear trees” packs two senses into five words. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to attract windblown thorns”—could trim to “attracted windblown thorns,” but such loops are rare and never cluster near closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the read-aloud rhythm breathes with the orchard winds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The chalk-and-bell refugee relay flips the usual haunted-ruin trope into an infrastructure fable: the ghost is not vengeful but logistical. Combining orchard pastoral with levitating mining arches creates a fresh visual grammar. The nebula-of-respite concept could feel generic, yet here it is gated by communal sweat and pollen-dulled hardware, grounding the cosmic in the agricultural.</comment>
