<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s calm indexer-brain is vividly embodied (“readjusted my gloves, steadied my breathing”) and her solitary choice carries cost. The interior contradiction—seeking truth while preparing to conceal it—peaks when she leaves the stamp behind. Micro-choices (photographing cards, restoring cabinet) align with motive, though the swim-out beat could show slightly more bodily strain to nail earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photographed cards + restored title reweight the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain—blackout → access → coded catalog → stamp reveal → decision to smuggle evidence—holds tight. One smooth shard, orientation anchored by line 5, no prop teleporting. Cost is legible in the final “quiet weight.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sunken library constrains every move: silted water slows gesture, velvet rot limits safe grip, headlamp tunnel narrows perception. The card catalog’s scrambled order directly forces the indexing tactic that cracks the code. Micro-setting (stamp in velvet rot) becomes the hinge object. Environment is never backdrop; it shapes tactics and final image of the “new lantern inside.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proof of cartographic forgery—tightens when the lighthouse stamp converts suspicion into verifiable fraud. One meaningful reversal: blank cards are not missing data but receipts of theft, foreclosing the “ledgers never existed” hypothesis. Escalation is accumulative: each indexing pass deepens density rather than multiplying turns. Cost is visible in the decision to leave the physical stamp and carry only digital proof, accepting future vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed stillness emerges through action: blackout silence enables perception, indexing imposes order on chaos, final concealment preserves that order. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via ink surfacing under pressure and the closing “lantern inside.” Subtext in the blank cards’ indentations elegantly links council guilt to protagonist complicity. Final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice stays calmly analytical—“tranquilly perceptive”—even under water, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens during indexing, contracts during stamp reveal, mirroring attention. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression (“velvet rot”) and patterned listing of catalog anomalies teach the reader the indexing lens early and hold it to the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “pale tunnel through silted water” does three jobs at once. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors are coherent (city “held breath,” page “exhaled”) and avoid purple escalation. Minor filter verbs (“I knew”) are voice-motivated and sparse enough to retain immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The submerged forgery hunt fuses archival noir with eco-ghost city, a synthesis that feels fresh yet inevitable. Using card-catalog indentation as forensic evidence reconfigures a familiar library trope. Risk—solitary swim in blackout—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise could not swap settings without collapsing; specificity of lighthouse seal and waterlogged paper roots it here.</comment>
