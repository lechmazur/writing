<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mina’s interiority—logical dreamer who keeps proofs beside cloud sketches—remains concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (tying mirror shards, revising the wet-sand formula) externalizes her contradictory need for both certainty and mercy. The final basket ride crystallizes an earned endurance: she accepts that she may save only one timeline yet keeps launching, a visible cost paid in sleepless salt-stained pages. No stock labels; even “hope” is translated into coefficients. The only hairline slip is the off-stage townspeople’s instant belief, but her prior isolation in the grotto keeps the arc intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canopy lifts under an updraft whose equation she paid for with通宵 labor and mirrored cuts; the image reweights “hope” from abstraction to shared aerodynamic fact. Causal linkage holds—each balloon cluster tightens the gauge’s impossible readings until the sideways units stabilize into a lift column the town can ride. No teleporting props; the grandfather’s gauge is present from first beat. Cost is legible in the final line: “she did not know which world would be saved,” a foreclosed path that keeps consequence airborne.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tide-polished grotto is not backdrop but instrument: tidewater glow provides the only light for chalk proofs, salt spray warps notebook pages, constraining calibration. Mirror shards flash against star curves, turning visual detail into data. Spatial choreography stays clean—ledge, wet sand, beach mouth—every distance tracked as balloons exit. Micro-setting (brass gauge fogged by cavern breath) constrains the final reading that triggers town ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“puzzle out new equations for hope before despair turns habitual”—tightens with each sideways-unit reading; failure in one timeline is offset by another, but the price is sleepless vigil and the risk of saving none. Third cluster launch after divergence-term revision is the decisive narrowing: she trades certainty for ensemble agency. Pressure stays causal under Hybrid lens; no coincidence resolves. Final uplift is earned, not gifted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern-as-information: decorations encode hope into helical data streams readable across timelines. No moralizing; the final image of unknown salvation reweights earlier abstraction into communal lift. Subtext resides in mirrored flashes—reflection as both self-recognition and signal to others. Ambiguity lingers: mercy is possible yet unguaranteed, a resonant reconfiguration rather than a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Mina’s perceptual signature—she notices angles, coefficients, salt-crystallized symbols—without head-hop. Prose rhythm mimics breathing sea engine: long cadences for tide, staccato for gauge clicks. No filter-verb stacks; “the gauge did not follow the air” is direct perception. Voice modulates under stress—sentence fragments appear as dawn approaches—yet remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or calculation. Metaphors are controlled—“calm lightning” for mirror flash—never stacked. Information density high: “sideways units” compresses multiverse math into two words. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold sentences. Copy clean; pronoun “she” never drifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: balloon-as-data-packet across timelines turns a childish festival object into quantum semaphore. Risk-taking succeeds—non-literal lift units, chalk proofs from parallel selves—yet closure stays legible. Specificity of shell-spiral sequences prevents trope recycling. The premise would collapse if any element swapped; hence inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
