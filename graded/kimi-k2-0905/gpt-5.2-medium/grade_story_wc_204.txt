<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s distrust of perfection and longing for Mara are concrete and embodied; the bottled whisper gives him a tactile link to the past that drives every beat. His micro-choice to place the vial under the platen crystallizes the stakes and forecloses retreat. Interiority stays specific—no label-speak—and the final Earned Stasis (compressed eternity) carries visible cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible inert.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral print compresses eternity, Mara steps back onto the balcony, and the library’s rules rewrite under a single frozen instant—cost is the irreversible loss of negotiable reality. Causal chain holds: spiral frost → rupture demand → vial-under-platen → catalog shatter → mirror-image stasis. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<comment>Glass orchard, cloud sea, and frost-patterned bark are not backdrop; the transparent trunk’s thinness literally enables the final print-through, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Lio notices pressure clicks, ink scent, frost dots—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks press, vial, tree, balcony without drift. Weather (cooling dawn) directly triggers the frost that drives the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stop infinite revision to recover Mara—signals early and tightens once: the spiral frost forces the rupture choice that forecloses all future bargaining. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: the library’s reordering by desire and the frozen sky-mirror show the price of eternal stasis. Agency resides in Lio’s decisive pull of the lever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between perfection and rupture; no character states it. The printed frozen instant reweights every prior contract without moralizing. Subtext lives in the whisper’s fragmentary return and the spiral’s demand for breakage. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing: eternity compressed becomes a prison of stillness—resonant, non-literal, ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lio’s perceptual signature: “he read them like proofs,” “felt the way a single wrong letter destabilizes.” Syntax mirrors tension—short clauses before the press-bite, then longer reflective cadence. No dialogue, so voice modulation occurs through rhythmic compression and release. Vocabulary remains within a printer’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—glass, frost, ink—each recharged at closure. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, reveals motive, and advances action. Zero scaffolding; no artifacts in final third. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—“reality becomes negotiable” managed by a letterpress catalog—feels fresh yet inevitable. Frost dots as press instructions transform a lyric image into causal mechanism. Risk of rupture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis of print culture and ontic instability is specific to this voice; swap printer for any other trade and the story collapses.</comment>
