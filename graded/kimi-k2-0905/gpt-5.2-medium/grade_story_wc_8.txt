<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—comfort in the lie versus anger in the throat—grounds every beat; the bargain she offers crystallizes her hierarchy of values (truth without shaming vs. civic peace) with visible cost to both. Hadrin’s micro-shift from protector to confessing editor is credible because we watch the gold hawk judge him. The only minor slip is “emotional ventriloquism” in the phrase “grief weaponized,” which momentarily sounds like the author explaining. Otherwise motives, flaws, and status play cleanly under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: petal drop → meeting → reading aloud → parallel-drawing → bargain → transfer of satchel, each step a because/therefore that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—Mara physically takes the letter while promising to annotate Hadrin’s complicity, foreclosing the “noble lie” path forever. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. The single persistent constraint—her public annotation of his role—shapes the final image and satisfies the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is not backdrop; its hidden alcove enables the clandestine meeting and the ivy literally screens them from street view, constraining their tactical choices. The rosebush’s bareness recharges the opening image at the end, reweighting the city’s cycle of silence. Sensory selection (cold wind threading the ivy, lamp by the ticket window) is filtered through Mara’s archival gaze. Micro-setting—the oilcloth satchel handled twice—functions as the story’s mobile “room” and charges the final transfer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. civic peace—tightens when Mara forces Hadrin to read the incriminating paragraph aloud, converting abstract stakes into audible evidence. The single meaningful turn: she reframes the dispute from accusation to curatorial bargain, narrowing both their options. Cost is visible on-page: Hadrin’s public complicity will be archived; Mara must shoulder the political fallout of exhibit design. Under causal lens, escalation is driven by her successive micro-choices, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the parallel-drawing tactic: noble lies repeat across centuries, each calm buying future blood. Subtext lives in gesture—Hadrin’s “practiced sigh” and the hawk’s painted stare judge him more than Mara ever does. The final image of the bare rosebush reweights the opening petal, offering a non-literal answer: seasons of silence end only when someone carries the bare past into morning. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the satchel’s weight in her hand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual signature—ivy like “green hair,” the cabinet lock she repaired herself—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under reflective pressure then shortens at the bargain (“She stepped closer, took the satchel gently”) mirroring decision. Hadrin’s dialogue carries distinct bureaucratic cadence (“protect people… reopen old wounds”) versus her archival specificity. No filter-verb stacks; compression is taught early and paid off in the final clause “toward morning.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “ivy had overgrown the brick walls so completely that the nameboards looked like graves with green hair” fuses metaphor, status, and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances knowledge or pressure. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato bargain beats. One near-mixed metaphor—“weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke”—but physical logic holds (weeds ≠ smoke) and the image is saved by POV-coloration, so deduction stays minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “archivist recovers coerced truce letter” premise could feel familiar, but the negotiation via curated exhibit parallels and the rose-petal clock give it a fresh civic procedural slant. Risk is taken in making the climax a curatorial proposal rather than a theft or chase; the story commits fully to that quieter stakes line and earns resonance. Specificity of the gold-leaf hawk initial and the famine-relief blackmail transforms generic “founders lied” into lived municipal guilt. Not quite 9+ because the parallel-drawing device itself is named rather than dramatized in mid-story beats.</comment>
