<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s contradictory impulses—serenity masking guilt, artistry weaponized—are dramatized in embodied beats: the coat left behind, ink moving “backward,” fingers trembling on the carved questions. The final renunciation (contract on a napkin) is earned by the reversed puppet show that forces him to see harm. Mara’s request “don’t use me” crystallizes cost; his compliance forecloses his former method. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Ilya signs a binding napkin contract that permanently limits his artistic license—felt cost is the applause he must now forgo. Causal chain holds: argument → dome reversal → public backward show → consent contract. Orientation clean by word 80. One transition (gallery→dome→bar→dome) stays legible; pattern taught early. No plot amnesia; the stolen stick returns to exact price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome’s “meteor hush” acoustic and the curved projection wall actively constrain performance choices; the campfire stick’s cedar scent triggers guilt, guiding reversal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through three venues. Weather (“cold tin sky”) mirrors internal chill yet never over-symbolizes. The stick and dome together charge the final communal shadow-play—environment shapes tactics and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><answer>Dominant stake—can he create art without theft of voice—tightens when Mara’s veto threatens future work. Escalation: private reversal → public exposure → contractual self-limitation; each step forecloses easier options. The backward puppet show makes harm visceral, raising audience discomfort as proxy cost. Final contract embodies visible price: shared proceeds and veto power cede control.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—consent in storytelling—emerges through the stick’s carved questions and the reversed plot that exposes erasure. No moralizing; the sister’s final puppet line reweights earlier laughter into complicity. The napkin contract’s ink literalizes the ethical turn without abstract assertion. Resonance lingers in the dome’s communal shadow-circle, inviting reader to apply the questions outward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Ilya’s urbane perceptual filter—calligraphic metaphors, ink-as-blood diction. Sentence rhythm lengthens during reversal, mirroring backward motion. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior accessed only through gesture and speech. Dialogue in bar carries subtext (“You reversed the story”) that advances plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ink moved backward, memories rearranged too” compresses two jobs. Figurative control sustains ink/echo/meteor motifs without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) stays within artist’s lexicon. Final line “only ending worth writing was one everyone could consent to” lands clean, no drumbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stolen camp stick + reverse puppet show + decommissioned dome as ethics lab. Backward narrative device makes visible harm rather than clever twist. Risk—serene artist sabotages own marketability—pays off in napkin contract. Specificity of calligraphic reversal and radar echo avoids generic redemption arc.</comment>
