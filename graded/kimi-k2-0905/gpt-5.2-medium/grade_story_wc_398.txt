<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel’s quiet, vine-wise stoicism is vividly embodied; his gentle persuasion credibly bends the night’s encounter without slipping into sage cliché. Mara’s translator restlessness is sketched through gesture and letter-ash rather than label, and her choice to keep the unread pages feels earned. Both voices stay distinct in dialogue, and the shared burn-line comparison gives a micro-choice that tilts their mutual stance. Interior contradiction is present yet lightly handled—could have carried one more beat of self-interested impulse to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lantern approach → offer of pavilion → parallel readings → joint renunciation of erasure, each step a because/therefore tightening of options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the letters remain unburned, the cost is the ache of witness they now share, and the sentinel leaves “less mismatched.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) settle within 70 words and never waver. No plot amnesia; the burned scraps on the table persist as the tactile price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Vineyard rows, amber pavilion glass, and the faint wire hum create a selective, sensory triad that mirrors internal stakes without tourist excess. The pavilion’s retained heat functions as micro-setting that enables the slow confession—remove it and the scene freezes. Spatial choreography is clean: bench-to-tracks-to-trellis-to-table tracked without drift. Environment never merely decorates; it supplies the literal warmth that keeps two strangers talking until dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to finish burning the letters—surfaces by line 12 and escalates through the offer of shelter, the parallel burn-line reading, and the final decision to let the pages live. One meaningful tightening suffices: the act of reading aloud converts abstract regret into shared witness, foreclosing the erasure option with visible emotional cost. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues them. Could use one more external jeopardy flicker (distant train, colder wind) to push into 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “destined mismatches” emerges through grafting metaphor and cork-in-wrong-bottle image rather than thesis statement. Subtext lives in silence while the letter is read—no commentary, just moonlit amber steeping the words. Final image of the sentinel returning to “my rows” reweights the opening solitude into chosen stewardship rather than exile. Avoids moral arithmetic; both keep the charred edge as reminder, a quiet conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a vineyard worker’s patient attentiveness: wires “hummed like distant strings,” shadows “steeped in honey.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with night air, then tightens into vine-graft metaphor without register drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent—what he can’t know (Mara’s full past) remains outside the frame. Dialogue indirection (“I answered with… attention to what was already true”) keeps persuasion soft, voice-intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: no paraphrase loops, no filler filters. Figurative layer is dense but each image (crushed skins, held breath of pavilion) advances atmosphere or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“cork that belongs to one bottle yet is pressed into another until both bleed”—skirts physical impossibility yet reads as character speech, not artifact. Final paragraph lands with cadence shift that mirrors dawn exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: night-watch vignette becomes gentle intervention against literary arson. Grafting metaphor for romantic mismatch feels specific to vineyard life, not borrowed. Risk is low-heat quietness—no theft chase, no storm—but the commitment to that quietude is itself the bold choice. Could push further into sensory risk (taste of smoke on grapes?) to feel utterly singular.</comment>
