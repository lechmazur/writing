<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—engineer’s certainty vs. caretaker’s empathy—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands, chain offer, and final steady grip trace a visible cost. Rolen’s silent swallow and confession supply credible secondary pressure. The only keep-away from 9 is that Rolen’s “slyly heartfelt” trait is asserted rather than embodied in diction or gesture before the reveal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blank note → adhesive test → chain decoding → pulse-gate solution → public confession → shared measurement. Each beat narrows options and raises social cost; the final accord is a decisive change charged by the risk both machinists accept. Closure lands with the chain literally in new hands—felt, physical, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The breathing volcano—warm vent, ash exhale—acts as living tool rack: the vent heats the slide, the ash cloud cloaks the accord. The antique chain is handled, measured, and finally transferred, its links constraining the gate settings. Spatial choreography is immaculate; only the mill owner’s spit lacks sensory follow-through.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—town safety vs. wetland survival—tightens when the encoded settings force a public gamble: reveal hidden science or let both sides lose. The mid-scene reversal (Mara decodes, stakes jump from “prank” to “career-ending leak”) is propelled by her choice, not luck. Cost is legible: Rolen’s reputation and Mara’s future contracts hang on the signed chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—kindness as engineered safety factor—emerges through stress-line drawings and the chain’s measured mercy, never sermonized. Final image of shared measurement reconfigures “compromise” as infrastructural love. One soft echo: “kindness was already there” edges toward articulation, but the line is earned by preceding hydraulics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter: resin threads are “tiny dashes and knots,” council voices “seemed less certain.” Syntax lengthens under argument, shortens under discovery. No head-hop; Rolen’s swallow is externally observed, maintaining distance. Only nit: “dappled resolve” is lovely but abstract amid engineering diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, metaphor, tech data—without crowding. “Amphitheater exhaled, scattering ash like stage dust” packs closure image and tactile cue in one breath. Zero loops, no filter-verb stacks, rhythm modulates with debate tempo. Metaphors (glue map, chain language) stay coherent and volcano-anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Flood-engineering politics inside a breathing volcano amphitheater feels instantly new; encryption via plant-resin dye on antique surveyor chain is a fresh spy-device. The rival-machinist silent collaboration flips the “lone genius” trope into mutual measurement. Risk—blank note as engineering haiku—pays off in emotional, not gadget, satisfaction.</comment>
