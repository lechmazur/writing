<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—curator’s duty vs. hunger for forbidden knowledge—remains vivid and embodied; the bathroom mirror beats crystallize her aging dread. Yet the final acceptance (“keep history honest by keeping it complicated”) is asserted more than dramatized: we see no micro-choice that enacts the cost (she simply re-boxes the cameo). The grandmother-cameo externalizes guilt, but Mara’s agency in that moment is off-stage, softening the earned sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard is her family’s archive and she has already carved the face, so her future is foreclosed. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reordering logbook pages, tags, mirrors—culminating in a charged crystallization. Causality is lyric-loose but coherent; cost is legible in the cameo’s returned stare. Orientation is taught early via “between first and last page,” waiving spatial debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard’s star-fruit falling upward and compost-pit child-laugh are sensory, selective, and thematically mirrored to Mara’s inverted timeline. Micro-setting (bathroom mirror as time-filing cabinet) constrains her epistemology and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean within the domes; no white-room syndrome. One 9+ gate met: recurring mirror-object directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of memory lineage—signals early. Middle tightening: logbook pages reorder, tags pre-date her writing, forcing her to confront pre-destination. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she loses authorship of her own past. Agency is largely reactive; the final acceptance is intellectual rather than a visible tactic-altering choice, keeping the escalation just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as inherited burden that resists ethical erasure—emerges through recursive images (blank cameo, mirror, logbook) rather than statement. Subtext in the grandmother’s wide-eyed cameo reweights the premise without moralizing. Final line’s “keep it complicated” is the closest to thematic echo, but reads as earned stance, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers: complicity or liberation? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (“catalog the astral orchard,” “filing moments like specimens”) is curator-specific and rhythmic. Compression (“star-fruit fall upward”) teaches lyric pattern early and holds. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register stays within Mara’s scholarly lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. One hairline slip: “simply complicated” edges toward oxymoron gimmick but is absorbed by voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering (“constellations like fruit”) is selective, never clotted. No loops or scaffold; information dual-purposed. One mixed image: “brightened disquiet” is abstract, but fits tone. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction appears in narration, yet aligns with curator mindset. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Combines museum cataloging with nonlinear botanic genealogy—fresh synthesis. The pistachio-shell cameo as time-USB is specific, not quirky ornament. Risk: circular time-loop accepted as family archive; payoff justifies gamble. Transformation test fails if replaced: only this orchid-pistachio-mirror lattice can enact memory laundering. +0.3 risk bonus applied.</comment>
