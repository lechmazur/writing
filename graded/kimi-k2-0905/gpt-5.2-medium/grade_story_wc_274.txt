<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s contradictory impulses—protect sister vs expose rot—are alive in the moment of scanning the letter; the final nod shows a paid-for shift in their relation. Interiority stays concrete, frost on cabinets, warm paper, no label-speak. Micro-choice of mis-filing as “public scholarship” crystallizes value hierarchy under pressure. Cost is legible: professional death now possible, archive no longer tomb but forum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: warm letter → scan → network wake → Council confrontation → transparency order, each step because/therefore. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost: consoles forcibly reconnected, archivist named publicly, career path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“echoing library under snow”). No plot amnesia; thaw log paired with letter pays off in Mara’s route exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost-rimmed cabinets, nitrogen sleep, copper veins behind walls—details are selective, tactile, and guide the scanner choice. Snow-muffled exterior mirrors the hush that must be broken. Setting constrains: only the dormant console array can ripple the city, making the library itself the weapon. Final image of lights flickering under falling snow recharges the opening bell metaphor with new civic meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence vs forced truth—tightens when the letter names a Council lover and stolen thaw schedules; stakes become visceral once the archivist imagines their own cryo drawer. One meaningful escalation: mis-file tagged “public scholarship” narrows options irreversibly; no take-back possible. Cost is visible on-page: Council arrives, Censor speaks the archivist’s full name as sentence. Coincidence complicates (letter warmth) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of institutional thaw emerges from action—cold archive, warm letter, reconnected networks—never stated. Final image reweights premise: archive shifts from tomb to forum, a conceptual repricing with social cost. Subtext in Mara’s wind-reddened eyes and the Censor’s appropriation of “transparency” shows power absorbing dissent. Ambiguity remains: Mara may still fall, city may freeze again, but silence is no longer default.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a curator’s precision: “nitrogen,” “cryo drawer,” “indexing consoles,” yet turns lyrical under stress—“echoing library listened like a buried bell.” Syntax lengthens then fragments as pressure spikes, mirroring dread. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to archivist. Distinct perceptual signature: attention to temperature, hush, stained glass—winter archivist’s gaze throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from vaulted cadences to clipped revelation; no template churn. Metaphors stay coherent—snow as muffler, copper veins, pond ripple—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, world rule, and emotional tilt. Zero loops or scaffold in final third; closure image clean. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized options”) fits archivist’s idiolect, not register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Frozen-archive-as-weapon is fresh; contraband truth as temperature literalizes censorship. Cryogenic librarian sabotaging silence via mis-file feels inevitable yet unvisited. Risk—turning library into public forum—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail (thaw log paired with patrol route) transforms generic leak into personalized sabotage. Final transparency appropriation by Censor flips expectation, showing power’s ability to absorb scandal—an insight not stated but earned.</comment>
