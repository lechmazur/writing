<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and body-bound; the proprioceptive curse makes every joint “confess,” a lived contradiction that drives all later choices. The decision to read the mercy-equation aloud is earned: only a body tuned by cruelty can unlock the archive, so the final walk-back costs the last of his safety. No second character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; survivor’s self-interrogation suffices. Flaw persists: he remains complicit recorder, not savior—an enduring cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the forest’s pollen burns away anesthesia and rewrites mercy as release for the tortured, absolving victims not perpetrators—an undeniable reweighting of the premise. Causal chain holds: strap → tremor-code → equation → spoken witness → pollen purge, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who-where-when) arrive by line 3; disorientation is thematic, not structural, and pays off in final image. Cost is legible in the last line—“a map in my skin”—permanent somatic inscription.</comment>

<comment>Ultraviolet forest is no backdrop: glowing trunks, violet pollen, and antiseptic air actively filter perception and trigger memory codes. Pewter strap serves as micro-setting, handled in every beat, staining palm and finally burning clean—object-as-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean: face-down → between trunks → cedar brace → fallen tree, each position linked to a bodily angle the POV can’t ignore. Environment constrains the only possible path to the equation, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover mercy’s formula to free future prisoners—tightens once: realizing he must vocalize the equation to the trees, a narrowing that forecloses silent theft. Escalation is textural: each flare of proprioceptive memory increases density until the final pollen surge reweights the stake from personal escape to collective absolution. Agency is intact; every coordinate is walked by his own tremor-coded knees. Cost is visible in the searing pollen that brands the strap and skin, payment for unlocking the archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mercy is a function that discounts pain by intention, but the system hid this to preserve power. Final reconfiguration—mercy computed to release the tortured, not the torturers—lands without moralizing statement, carried by the image of violet pollen burning the strap clean. Subtext operates in silence: the tribunal’s absence feels louder than any accuser. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—the reader shares the weight transferred from conscience to forest, left with the map in his skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is relentless, synesthetic, and proprioceptively precise: “every joint reports its angle like a confession I cannot stop hearing.” Syntax mirrors trauma—long clauses that spasm into fragments under memory spikes. No dialogue, so naturalism/subtext bullets n/a. Compression (“I did not come to repent”) and elision (“the old order to cooperate”) are taught early and paid off in final spoken equation, keeping closure legible under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with memory flashes, then lengthens during the equation reading, mirroring cardiac cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—metal, sap, bruise, pollen—each returning to charge the final image; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot: “feeling displaced rooted at once” could lose “at once,” but the line still propels. No loops, no synonym churn; information density stays high without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of forensic mathematics with bioluminescent arboreal archive feels non-obvious and inevitable: only cruelty-tuned bodies can decrypt mercy. The ultraviolet penance trope is inverted—forest does not absolve torturers but liberates victims from internalized guilt. Specific detail (“pewter strap cut loose from the hood”) prevents generic dystopia; risk lies in making torture survivor the decrypting instrument, yet the piece confronts that moral cost. Fresh inflection: mercy as a recursive function whose output is release, not forgiveness.</comment>
