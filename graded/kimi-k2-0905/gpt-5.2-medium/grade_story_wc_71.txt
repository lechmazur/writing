<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—testing the clock move, weighing the hush-shard—that escalate to the climactic communal re-placing; the final renunciation on the tideline costs her the private tool, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the coworkers’ tease is told, not dramatized, so the social stakes of her odd gift remain off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the released hush spreads over the street, reconfiguring the town’s aliveness-rule with undeniable conceptual cost (“a city can burn quietly with belonging”). Causal chain holds—each object replaced tightens the house-warmth—until the deliberate sacrifice severs her private access. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, paid off in final iris-note image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (boardwalk, alcove, tideline) track throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The quiet bay, salt-grass, and lantern-lit interiors are filtered through Mara’s scent-oriented perception; orris and cedar carry plot function, constraining her choices like a dowsing rod. Weather (storm blackout) forces the communal climax, proving environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting—the orris shard in her pocket—literally charges the final image. One hairline slip: “streetlights daydream” is lovely but re-used three times without re-weighting, a faint static echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can attention restore aliveness?”—tightens via each object-placement; the clock-moan beat shows immediate cost, foreclosing the option to treat placement as casual. Final release of the shard is irreversible, narrowing her future methods. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: density of iris scent + neighbor laughter = undeniable reweighting. Could touch 9 if one beat showed a personal trade-off (sleep, wages, friendship) rather than purely ethical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: aliveness as communal attention, not magic. Subtext lives in gesture—returning a whale carving hands the owner back his childhood, wordlessly. Final line re-prices the premise, refusing moral sermon. The only whisper of echo: “A house lives when it can recognize itself” lands perilously close to thesis-statement, but immediate laughter-without-echo earns the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s synesthetic attention; diction—“bulbs dimming as if remembering sunlight”—is hers alone. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for hush, staccato when the wind moans. No head-hopping; neighbors’ interiority surfaced only through Mara’s sensory read of laughter. Compression (“she sanctified the only way she knew”) is taught early and paid off, meriting high-band tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or rule. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—“hushed blaze,” “compact quiet”—and culminate in the final iris-note. One microscopic scaffold: “the conversations made a gentle heat you could feel through plaster” is slightly explanatory, but it caps rather than stalls the beat, so penalty stays sub-deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Attention as scent trapped in matter” is fresh synthesis; domestic magic via estate-catalog objects flips standard haunted-house trope. Risk: lyric ellipsis, mosaic shards, yet pattern taught by 25% and closure legible. Specificity—dockside perfumer, orris root, whale carving—anchors universals. If the concept were swapped the emotional arc collapses, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
