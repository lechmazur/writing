<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Galen’s quiet, tactile curiosity is consistent and embodied; the lantern-cradling beat crystallizes his “sharp gentleness.” Yet his interiority never quite splits under pressure—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time—so the final rotation feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won. Sera’s twin-state face-fusion supplies micro-cost, but Galen’s own stake in the choice stays level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the oasis selects one timeline because of how they met it with care, and the crumbling combs give visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early by the overlapping footprints and holds to the final chimney note. One transition (dusk → night) is clean; orientation is anchored by lantern and spring within 120 words. No late rule changes; the thrum’s final single note reweights all prior fractures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kiln-like hives, soot-scratched lens, and fused wax combs are tactile and selective; each returns to constrain the final act of rotation. Micro-setting (the lantern) literally refracts choice. Brackish spring and flattened smoke serve more than backdrop—they meter the timeline collapses. Spatial choreography stays clean across the short scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the lantern’s thrum warns of shadow-splits. The meaningful deepening occurs at the chimney shimmer: Galen realizes the oasis stores timelines like stacked bowls, foreclosing the option to break it and forcing the gentler alignment. Cost is legible in the crumbling combs and clearing spring. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through the kiln metaphor: resistance as refuge until met with softness. No moral is stated; the final image of smoke finally rising reweights the premise without exposition. Subtext lives in lantern-handling and wax scent—quiet invitations rather than symbols. Ambiguity lingers: the oasis may yet shift again, but now it carries their imprint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Galen’s potter-perception: “sharp gentleness,” “phototropic to kindness.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with his testing beats, then shortens at the final rotation. No head-hopping; Sera’s interior is legible only through Galen’s read of her fused smile. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative layering (“little kilns,” “pressed-gray lid”) is sparse and purposeful—no metaphor pile-ups in the climax. One paraphrase loop: “flattened again overhead” echoes the earlier smoke line, but it serves as accumulative echo rather than scaffold. High information density; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The beekeeping oasis as temporal kiln is fresh; the potter’s optic on stacked timelines feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk is taken with lyric non-linear causality, but pattern is taught and paid off. Could edge higher if the scavenger girl’s stake were less ancillary.</comment>
