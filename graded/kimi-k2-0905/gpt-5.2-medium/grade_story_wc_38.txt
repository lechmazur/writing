<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s calm defiance is embodied through micro-choices—rolling the dice, dancing the cipher—so motive stays legible under pressure. The interior contradiction (vulnerability vs encryption) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation of the journal carries felt cost. Oren’s flicker of recognition supplies relationship crucible without crowding POV. Only the absence of an on-page mistake that compounds keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyra forecloses her old life by leaving the journal—visible cost in the final image. Causal chain holds: dance-cipher → guardian fooled → pods open; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is taught early by saltwater pressing cracked glass; no disorientation serves the ending. One meaningful tightening—rerouting alarms into drowned sensors—narrows options under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lab’s saltwater, coral-scabbed door, and waist-deep flood constrain every move; the dice and spider web function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Lyra notices machine meter before she notices her own breath. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pressure lock to manual wheel to exit hatch. Environment is not backdrop; it enables the acoustic reroute that frees the detainees.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate Oren without triggering broadcast—is signaled by line 4 and tightened when the guardian cuts lights. Lyra’s dance-cipher is an active tactic that forecloses speech; cost is visible when she abandons her journal. No coincidence resolves; the spider’s drop is a cue she planted. One micro-turn suffices at this length, but a second beat of external pressure would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—encrypt vulnerability into strength—emerges through action: the dice-nooses, the dance-cipher, the journal left as decoy. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of harmless verse reweights prior material. Subtext in guardian’s whispered greeting shows how intimacy is weaponized. Ambiguity lingers: council may still read her body’s static as future evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Lyra’s perceptual signature—she hears meter in machine noise, sees tide marks as code. Syntax lengthens during cipher-writing, shortens under guardian threat, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Oren’s recognition is external, filtered through Lyra’s hope. Compression (“cold as diagnosis”) is voice-motivated, taught early, and paid off when water surges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “saltwater pressed against cracked glass like a slow drum” anchors setting, stakes, and Lyra’s sonic bias. No scaffold loops; each clause advances. Figurative language is patterned—spider, dice, web—and never muddies causality. One mixed vehicle—“alarms sang only to themselves”—is allowed because it is closure-adjacent and thematically apt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of choreographic cryptography with drowned-noir lab feels inevitable, not grafted. Hangman’s dice transform from macabre keepsake to cipher key to sacrificed evidence. Risk—using dance as code—pays off because failure (guardian detects) is implied. The premise could not swap names or places without collapse; the specificity is the freshness.</comment>
