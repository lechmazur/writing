<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—record vs. release, stay vs. migrate—are dramatized in micro-choices (handling cicada, hiding jars) and embodied in tactile detail. Iven’s shift from anger to fear is shown through thumb on seam and silence, not labels. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she foregoes immediate confession of the hidden copies, accepting relational risk. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair step into foam under stars with the harbor still coming, jars still hidden, trust deferred—felt cost is the unspoken lie. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tide image thickens stakes until the final paradox of erased footprints/unchanged beach reweights meaning. Causality intact: cicada use → foresight → decision to withhold maps. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Grotto, trapped pool, star-crack, and jade cicada function as micro-setting that constrains movement and focus. Spatial choreography clean: lamp set, starlight line drawn, bodies track. Tidal pool imagery evolves from mapping tool to time-texture metaphor, charging final image. Environment directly shapes the foresight beat and the choice to withhold jars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve living shore vs. surrender records—tightens when council demand is revealed mid-scene. One meaningful deepening: Mara’s hidden copies foreclose easy compliance and raise personal risk. Agency visible: she activates cicada, chooses tangent question, decides to stay silent. Cost legible: relational trust deferred, future labor doubled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-texture emerges through recurrent tidal images and cicada handling; never stated abstractly. Final paradox—waves erase yet beach remains—offers resonant non-literal answer to her quest. Subtext in Iven’s thumb, starfish memory, and unmentioned jars deepens emotional complexity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature: “time felt like wet stone,” “moment thickened like syrup.” Syntax lengthens during foresight, then shortens at decision, mirroring tide rhythm. No head-hopping; Iven’s interiority inferred only through gesture and silence. Diction remains within her chronicler lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—two similes total, both tide-linked. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. High information density: one sentence often advances image, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. Final line earns cadence shift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-pool chronicler + jade cicada as time-dowsing device transforms familiar eco-fiction trope. Tangential approach as narrative method mirrors thematic search for indirect knowledge. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final paradox. Specificity of equinox pool and glass jars prevents generic swap.</comment>
