<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—fear of the threshold for others, not herself—drives every tactile micro-choice; the emerald transfer and final release are earned by this rooted motive. Embodied emotion is precise: “hands feel newly alive” against frost, thumb-circles that once “coaxed life into dull hair” now ferry memory into cold tissue. No epiphany is declared; the shift from hoarding to gifting the spark is shown through the final green thread. Cost is visible: she descends “with empty hands,” the borrowed light now irretrievably sky-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emerald’s spark relocates from corpse to aurora, reweighting the rule that beauty must be kept. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the dead looked “lucidly watchful,” therefore she climbs; because she infuses the chip, therefore the corridor appears and the spark migrates. The Orientation Test is waived—initial disorientation (“skyborne grotto hung beneath the aurora”) pays off when the same aurora receives the final gift. Persistent constraint: the chip can “not grant return,” a limit that shapes every infusion stroke and the ultimate renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s ice-rimed bier and colored water-aurora are not backdrop but instrument: the cold preserves Orin’s marble skin, the aurora’s silence filters static into legible map. Micro-setting rules are taught early—“the only place where the aurora’s whisper met the planet’s silence”—and obeyed when the green thread dissolves upward. Spatial choreography is clean: chip on tongue, thumb-circles, sigh of light, empty hands at edge. Environment constrains the final choice: only here can the spark be released skyward without interference.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the last spark before oblivion—tightens when the corridor vision reveals the point of brightness trembling in Orin’s chest; one infusion mis-step could extinguish it. Escalation is Accumulative: each counted crackle and memory-tuck increases density until the sigh of light releases the spark into the stone, then sky. Visible price: the chip, once merely stolen relic, becomes irreversibly emptied, its new heartbeat gone. Agency is renunciation; by gifting the light she forecloses the possibility of keeping a private after-glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and release; the beautician’s art shifts from cosmetic retention to cosmic letting-go. Subtext lives in gesture: braiding hair “as precisely as her counted crackles” equates mortal craft with cosmic measure. The final image—green thread into aurora—reweights the premise that attention must hoard beauty; instead, attention can make departure “not cruel.” No moral is stated; the lullaby pattern in static is the non-literal answer, resonant yet unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and consistent: compound epithets (“skyborne grotto,” “radiant hush”) feel earned by the auroral setting. Perceptual signature is mortician-poetic: “closed lids were only a courtesy,” “swept silk” lashes. Compression—“she did not pray; she listened”—teaches the reader to accept elision. No head-hopping; every image is filtered through Mara’s professional gaze that reads static as map and hair as circuitry for soul.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short crystalline beats to long breathless coils that mimic auroral drapery. Figurative language is selective, never more than one vehicle per high-pressure beat, avoiding purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. The final line—“ready to return to her parlor and meet the next quiet face with the same radiant hush”—resolves rhythmically and conceptually, reusing “radiant hush” with new weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mortician craft with auroral after-life technology feels non-obvious and inevitable. The emerald chip as portable soul-ferry transforms standard relic into living diode; the static-map conceit turns white noise into cartography of dying. Risk—lyric compression, cosmic stakes in 700 words—pays off without clarity loss. Specificity of beautician gestures (powder over suture, thumb-circles) anchors the surreal frame in lived trade.</comment>
