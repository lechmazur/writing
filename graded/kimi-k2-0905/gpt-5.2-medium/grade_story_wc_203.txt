<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s observant trait is embodied through tactile dust-reading and ladder-mark detection, grounding his ghost-engaging ritual in vocational skill. Interiority stays concrete: “responsibility without a body” crystallizes his liminal burden. The final chalk mark and pocketed mainspring show a micro-choice that costs him continued haunting duty, earning credible endurance. Yet the ghosts remain symbolic mirrors rather than pressure sources, so the relational crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chalked crack and warming barrel reconfigure his eternal vigil without resolving it, cost felt in the quiet shaft. Causal chain—dust pattern → ceiling panel → spring retrieval → slack chain → chalk seal—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the modern control cabinet appears only at the reveal, not seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through technician gaze: fluorescent buzz, machine-oil/peanut odor, ladder-scuffed dust gradients. The cracked clown façade and mirrored ceiling fissure physically manifest the “leak between eras,” charging the final chalk gesture. Spatial choreography is clean—counter climb, panel slide, pocket exit—every move tracked. The ticket-window crowd reflection supplies a resonant last-image callback, reweighting the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—tightens when dust forensics reveal the hidden lift and the ghosts’ payroll secret. Agency is investigative: each observation narrows options toward the spring barrel extraction. Cost is atmospheric rather than visceral: he seals the portal and carries the time-weight forward. A slightly higher gear would require an explicit forfeiture (tool, safety, or social credit) on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodial time-keeping emerges through the mainspring barrel, dust layers, and cracked façades—time literally stored and released. No moralizing; the final image of the warming “small heart” in his pocket reweights his burden without statement. Ghosts as lint-like residue evokes memory’s persistence, but subtext stays implicit. The concept could deepen if the city’s dead ever resisted his chalk seal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries technician precision: “clean arcs where cables once swung,” “drifts where air had been trapped.” Rhythm modulates—long sensuous sentences for discovery, clipped fragments at the drop. No head-hop; ghosts communicate via gesture and gaze, keeping focalization tight. One elevated phrase—“leak between eras”—slips toward abstraction but is earned by prior concrete scaffolding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances observation or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physical—“lint on my sleeves,” “slow metallic sigh”—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor filter verb cluster around “I felt” could trim two instances, but immediacy remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator repair with ghost-custody is fresh; the payroll-lift driven by a clock mainspring is a specific, non-obvious invention. Dust forensics as detection method repurposes mundane detail into plot engine. Circus setting risks trope but avoids cliché by focusing on the ticket office void rather than big-top spectacle. The concept commits fully, never retreating to safer ground.</comment>
