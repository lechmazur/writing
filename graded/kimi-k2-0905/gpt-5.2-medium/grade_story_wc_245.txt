<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iris’s grief-driven vocation and tactile genius are vivid; the brother-stone heartbeat gives her a final, embodied cost. Yet the interior contradiction—wanting both to map and to drown in loss—stays summary; we never feel her momentarily wish to turn back. Micro-choices (ring bite, kneel) are present but sparse, so the arc reads more mythic than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation lands with felt weight: she exits carrying “steadier grief,” a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard layers density until the pool silence cancels the ultrasonic choir, reweighting the stake from escape to acceptance. Causality holds: every bark-hand or ring-tug causally feeds the inner map. Closure is on-page—ring clicks still, sentence “you can miss him and still live” is the Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Orientation is taught early by scent/breath anchors; no teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>Forest is rendered through non-visual senses—air-currents as “raised ink,” leaves “vibrating like glass”—and the pool micro-setting becomes the constraint that forces the final stillness. Platinum ring, bark scraps, and heartbeat-stone are handled repeatedly; their evolving thermal/tactile states alter her path. Spatial choreography is clean: ring low, palm to stone, kneel at pool edge. Environment directly shapes the final choice; without the ultrasonic null-point the acceptance cannot occur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn grief into navigable terrain—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each language absorbed tightens the internal map until the brother-stone adds panic, raising the cost of continuation. The pool silence is the single decisive intensification that forecloses escape and forces acceptance. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as unmappable coast that must still be sailed—emerges through the accretion of tactile languages and the final lullaby braid. Subtext lives in the ring’s warming metal: the closer she comes to acceptance, the more it hurts. Final sentence is an earned CR, not a moral: it reweights every prior map from boundary to current. Ambiguity remains: she will keep mapping, but now with loss as datum, not destination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Iris’s haptic perception; syntax lengthens and shortens with breath-like cadence. Diction—“ultrasonic choir,” “grammar of heartbeats”—is precise yet never exceeds a blind cartographer’s conceptual reach. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Patterned elision (e.g., leaves “like glass”) is taught early and paid off in the mirrored pool, keeping closure legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the staccato “ring clicked to stillness,” mirroring the approach to stillpoint. Figurative density is high but each metaphor advances either map-language or grief-texture; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold risk: “quiet blaze” is repeated; however, it is the assigned tonal motif, hence justified. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; information per sentence remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Blind mapmaker who burns charts by memory and scent, then absorbs languages through skin, feels genuinely new. The ultrasonic forest as emotional LORAN station synthesizes fantasy with sensory realism. Risk—using grief as literal geology—pays off because the brother-stone heartbeat is foreshadowed by “continent no one mapped.” Without these specificities the story collapses; hence irreplaceable.</comment>
