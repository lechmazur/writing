<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-protection—are alive in every beat: she pockets the aid, sits beside Eli instead of grabbing him, speaks into the phone knowing it may summon her own dead. The final transfer of the photograph to Eli crystallizes her hierarchy of values: another child’s life over her own anaesthetic. Micro-choices carry visible cost (ash-throat, warming aid) and the endurance is earned. No label-speak; interiority stays embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: photograph arrives → aid ticks → Mara traces call → interrupts Eli’s suicide → rewrites her childhood “STAY” into “STAY, PLEASE” → voice retreats. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same object now arms Eli against future calls, cost felt in the aid’s steady human-beat replacing ghost-pulses. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the aid’s cracked receiver—shapes every tactical move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, stairwell landing, and the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting all constrain movement and social distance; fogged glass literalizes the reeling hush. Sensory triage matches crisis: narrowed to pulses, smudged ink, sweat on envelopes. Spatial choreography is exact—Mara sits one step below Eli so the phone can be shared without intrusion. The auditorium ruin is recalled only as it charges the photograph’s final re-weighting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the dead from harvesting a living child—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when Mara realizes the caller is her own mother. One meaningful escalation: the sign’s second word revealed, shifting from command to plea, foreclosing Mara’s option to stay neutral. Cost is on-page: she shoulders the next call forever. Agency is renunciation/transfer rather than victory, fitting the elegiac mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: the living must revise the dead’s final, frozen script. Subtext carries in the smudged “PLEASE,” the warming aid, the transfer of guardianship. No moralizing—final line is image of her own heartbeat, a quiet conceptual repricing that silence can be chosen, not surrendered to. Ambiguity lingers: will Eli call her again? Complexity honored; no tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, synesthetic, slightly occult-tech: “electrical stutters,” “reeling hush,” “ash-full throat.” Syntax lengthens under grief, then fractures during the phone confrontation. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Mara’s naming of connections is persuasion-by-memory). Perceptual signature—pulse-hearing—never lapses into generic spookiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “the air held a reeling hush, as if the building itself waited” sets atmosphere and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses in atrium, staccato pulses in stairwell. Opening and closing lines bookend with the aid’s temperature, a subtle echo. Proofing clean; no mixed metaphors or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts” using an obsolete hearing aid—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Combines fire-trauma, orphan lore, and anti-suicide intervention without trope-stacking. The photograph’s smudged second word is a micro-twist that reconfigures the entire backstory. Risky second-person plea from dead mother pays off because causality holds. Specificity of soot-black finger, hand-lettered sign, cracked receiver makes the concept unrepeatable.</comment>
