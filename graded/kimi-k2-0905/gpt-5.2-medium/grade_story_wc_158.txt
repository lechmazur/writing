<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—soft-spoken yet “shyly unstoppable”—is dramatized in the solitary descent and the deliberate tearing of the postcard; the green-root epiphany is an embodied, costly choice. The centuries-long lineage is told, not shown, so the inherited weight feels abstract rather than personally bruising, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn postcard re-seeds the armistice, lilies re-bloom, and the city’s stance shifts from blade to listening—cost is the irreversible destruction of the card and Mara’s permanent exile from certainty about Iren. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral echo thickens pattern until the final cadence reweights peace itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shell’s calcium ribs, off-key wind, and pearl-colored cistern are tactile, selective, and directly constrain Mara’s path and song; the postcard-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its star-field dissolves into roots. One decimal off perfect only because plankton-drought causality is asserted, not witnessed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single tightening beat: the blackening lilies force Mara to risk the postcard, narrowing options from “keep memory” to “feed roots.” Cost is legible—the card is gone forever—but external war-pressure stays off-stage, so escalation is more lyrical intensification than causal chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vegetal metaphor: peace as photosynthetic process that turns salt/sorrow to sugar. The final taste-shift in the air reconfigures the meaning of every prior blossom without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—war may return, but the city now holds a song instead of a blade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Mara’s insomnia-filtered perception; diction (“reef-shadow joy,” “kelp-dreams”) is character-specific, rhythm waxes like breathing tide. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice modulates from hush to cradle-song without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, propel without scaffold; mixed metaphors are absent. A single paraphrase loop (“shyly unstoppable” repeated almost verbatim) costs a tenth; otherwise density is high and figurative language stays coherent even at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-shell city, star-postcard diplomacy, and salt-to-sugar peace are synthesized into a fresh emotional logic; the armistice-as-garden is an inversion that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression is fully committed to and pays off in the final breath.</comment>
