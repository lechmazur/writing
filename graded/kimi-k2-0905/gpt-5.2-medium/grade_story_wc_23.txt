<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The navigator’s interior contradiction—clinging to a dead station while guiding returners—grounds every beat; the embodied shame when admitting “I do not know whether the midnight caller is saving us or counting us” crystallizes cost. Micro-choice chain (sketching, tilting the censer foot, handing Sera the map) keeps agency live. Only flaw: Sera’s reunion beat is seen from outside, so the relationship crucible never fully pressures the narrator’s own wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: hydraulics fail → navigator builds armillary → midnight calls refine map → aqueduct reunion. Closure is Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts the device is “a promise,” not a machine, foreclosing the old guiding role with visible cost—“the stars thin to dawn.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One slight softness: the caller’s tower-bounce physics is asserted, not shown, but it does not resolve the climax, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Starlit dish, jammed doors, salt-flat wind, and the bronze foot’s warming weight are filtered through the navigator’s chart-eye: every detail either blocks or enables the next sketch. The censer foot operates as micro-setting, constraining the armillary’s tilt and final heading; its moon-phase heaviness charges the closure image. No sensory checklist; visual paired with metallic heat and hush of “second sky” lanterns. Spatial choreography clean across the aqueduct approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the navigator still guide anyone without hydraulics—tightens when each midnight call shrinks the safe corridor. Escalation is causal: censer weight → map revision → sinkhole warnings → final trek under full-moon drag. One visible price: the old compass identity is surrendered when the boy claims the radio. Pressure plateaus, however, during the lantern exposition; a second tightening would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—loss has a shifting topography—emerges through the armillary’s nightly reorientation, never sermonized. The censer foot’s moon-memory reweights “truth” from relic to living index, letting the final image refract the whole migration. Ambiguity lingers: promise vs. trap, salvation vs. census. No thematic echo; the last line lets dawn light do the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a chart-maker’s diction: “patina bronze censer foot,” “geometry of loss,” “constellations no longer trusted.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures during midnight calls—“three numbers and the word return.” No filter-verb stacks; perception stays anchored to bodily tension in the armillary screws. Dialogue minimal but distinct: the boy’s radio jargon contrasts with Sera’s half-prayer wound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control mirrors moon phases—lean clauses at thin crescent, heavier cadences at full. Information density high: one sentence often layers tool, body, and sky. One paraphrase loop (“the safest passage keeps changing, like grief”) is forgiven because it lands the thematic hinge. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration guided by a tide-remembering relic flips the frontier myth inward; the starlit station becomes hinge rather than edge. The bronze foot’s lunar fluctuation is not magical garnish but navigational logic, transforming old tech into living cartography. Risk—lyric ellipsis, no villain—pays off in resonant closure. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable: diaspora folding back on itself through a compass that admits loss is mobile.</comment>
