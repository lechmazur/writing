<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sava’s interior contradiction—panic vs hammered repose—remains embodied and specific; the ripple-marks on her wrists tingle under pressure, anchoring motive in flesh. Her micro-choice to offer the stone as covenant, not weapon, crystallizes a cost (the caves must forever host the beings), earning the quiet she seeks. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean. The only limit: the final endurance reads slightly serene given the scale of the gamble—still credible within her sonic asceticism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the beings drink vibration, therefore Sava redirects their hunger into the Forge; because she risks the stone, the caves regain layered music. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when land by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change with persistent cost: the Forge becomes a shared feeding ground, price etched in the new crack-circles she will eternally monitor. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; every beat grows from last.</comment>

<comment>Harmonic caves function as both atmosphere and tool: the crystal wall’s cavities amplify heartbeats, forcing Sava to slow her own rhythm to survive. Ice fissures act as a living map, their crack patterns steering her tactical path; the echo chamber stone’s gently luminous glow is tracked in hand, pocket, and final covenant—each state change alters possible moves. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a mapkeeper notices resonance before color. Environment constrains the climax; without the Forge’s geometry the redirection ritual would fail.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the caves’ song—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each feeding swell tightens the corridor chorus until the Forge redirection becomes the only remaining option. Agency sits in the conjuring beat; she risks the stone and her own pulse, foreclosing isolation for perpetual stewardship. Cost is legible: she gains quiet but inherits guardianship, a trade visible in the closing “updated living map.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: hospitality versus dominion—how to welcome the stranger without surrendering self. The bloom of hush is never moralized; it is practiced, tested, and paid for. Final image of strangers “slowed shimmer” reweights earlier dread into shared survival, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without sermon. Ambiguity remains: the caves may yet be swallowed, but now by consent, not conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Sava’s sonic perception: clauses lengthen and compress with reverberation, diction stays mineral and vibrational. No head-hopping; every metaphor is POV-plausible (“hammered repose,” “ripple-mark mapkeeper”). Compression in the conjure beat—“breathed until her ribs matched the cave’s pulse”—mirrors her bodily tuning. Voice is inseparable from world-logic; remove the cadence and the ritual fails.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long resonance-building clauses build to short strikes—“she placed the stone.” Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and paid off in the final net of echoes. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. A single filter-verb cluster (“she understood that if she could redirect…”) is minor enough to keep the 9-band in reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The acoustic ecology refugee crisis feels novel: light-storms that eat sound, mapkeepers who read ice-fissures, a covenant sealed by resonance rather than speech. Risk is high—lyric world-building could have collapsed into gimmick—but specificity (“crystal honeycombed with small cavities”) grounds the concept. The inversion of silence as cultivated moss, not absence, offers a fresh moral calculus. All choices grow from the premise; swap any part and the story fractures.</comment>
