<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lan’s interior fight—“remembering children he had comforted”—delivers embodied contradiction under possession; Sera’s micro-choice to sing dish-washing and net-mending reframes the stake and pays the cost. The moment the force exits through his confession, both characters’ motives crystallize with felt price. Relationship as crucible is light but sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave tunes perception, not destiny, and Lan’s unreliable sight is permanently exposed. Causal chain holds—pearl-light → possession → song → release—each beat narrows options until Sera’s plain chant reweights the world rule. Cost is legible in Lan’s stagger and the pearl’s dulled afterglow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cave geography is threaded through action—crystals chime underfoot, overlapping shadows braid bodies—so setting actively constrains the final exorcism. Micro-setting (pearl, calcite pedestal) doubles as tool that channels intention. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to Sera’s listening POV; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ordinary days to shimmer”—faces tangible test when possession threatens Lan’s life; escalation tightens once the force speaks. Agency shifts from Lan (failed prediction) to Sera (song as counter-pressure), foreclosing the option to treat magic as spectacle. Price paid: Lan’s clairvoyant authority is publicly hollowed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: wonder is not conjured but attended to; the final image of “ordinary footsteps newly enchanted” reweights every prior object. Subtext hums in the cave’s echo of intentions—what we notice we invite. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the pearl’s faint residual glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Sera’s ear, yet Lan’s infected double-voice ruptures cadence exactly where possession peaks. Syntax lengthens during song, then fractures—“two harmonies”—mirroring emotional surge. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent, compressing under stress without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but patterned: “overlapping shadows” recurs with accruing menace, never looped. Metaphors stay physical—“sky full of invisible birds”—and don’t crowd high-pressure beats. One clause drifts toward loftiness (“bright darkness was the surest way to listen”) yet serves theme; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cave-as-tuner and possession-via-attention invert standard oracle tropes; the twist that the clairvoyant didn’t foresee because he sought spectacle feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of dish-washing chant anchoring cosmic exorcism freshens familiar “magic in the mundane” arc. Risk in lyric compression pays off: final image recharges every sound-touched object.</comment>
