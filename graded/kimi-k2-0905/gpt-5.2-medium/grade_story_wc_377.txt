<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysa’s motive—preserve wonder via sound—remains steady; her micro-choices (spinning the wheel faster, retuning) embody it. No interior contradiction is dramatized, so the arc is linear rather than torn. The Auditor’s palm-burn supplies external pressure, but Lysa’s internal stakes never tighten; she wins without paying a visible personal cost. Still, her vocationally specific actions keep her from abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Auditor lets go, the crowd re-learns listening, and Lysa retunes—cost is the Auditor’s dissolved ledger and the melted fragment. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each rotation adds light/sound density until silence itself refracts. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. The ending reweights the premise—wonder is conducted, not stored—without explanatory moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyward bluff, cedar frames, glass vanes, and iceberg fragment are tactile, wind-battered, and light-splitting; every prop constrains Lysa’s tuning gestures. Cloud-sea and “slow blue archive” compress vast scale into sensorial immediacy. Spatial choreography is clean; Auditor’s reach and retreat track. Micro-setting (ice hub) becomes the lens that charges the final rainbowed silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve chromatic wonder against gray standardization—tightens when the Auditor demands mute bells be replaced; Lysa escalates by accelerating the wheel, forcing collective audition. No reversal: she keeps initiative, so escalation is intensification rather than option-narrowing. Cost is off-loaded onto Auditor’s ledger and the fragment, not Lysa’s body or future, keeping pressure one-sided. Sufficient for lyric mode but not razor-sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prismatic refraction: truth is spectral, not monochrome; silence can be tuned, not erased. No character moralizes; the melted basin’s soft chime is the non-literal answer. Subtext of collective doubt aligning against gray rules is legible in the hush that follows the symphony. Final image—rainbows from glass alone—reweights the premise without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual filter—wind grit, bell harmonics, light shards—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and shortens with rotational speed; diction is precise yet musical (“slow blue archive,” “bronze shims”). No dialogue, so voice carries entirely in textured narration; every clause does double duty (image + motion). Distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety mirrors carillon cadences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor extends the spectrum motif; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—each sentence advances wind-motion-light causality. One minor scaffold: “truth had a spectrum” is abstract, but immediately grounded by prismatic flash. Closure line breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Post-verbal world tuned by iceberg-driven light-carillon feels sui generis; premise commits fully. Risk—making silence the melodic carrier—pays off when mute bells shimmer in remembered refraction. No familiar plot armature; accumulation of color-in-sound is the engine. Could not swap fragment or wheel without collapsing the symphony. Fresh yet inevitable.</comment>
