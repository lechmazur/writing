<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—trust in images vs. need to re-engineer time—drives every micro-choice; the leaf-tick governor literalizes her father’s creed and costs her the last clean launch window, so the Earned Stasis lands with felt price. Competence is balanced by the quake she can’t stop and the pilot she couldn’t save; memory of Lio injects loss without explanatory filler. No label-speak; body and tool knowledge stay concrete, tactile, and specific to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: spinning hand → ruined tracking → leaf governor → stable lock → launch; each beat tightens the next under quake pressure. Closure is a Decisive Change: the pod escapes, the clock hand finally points, and Mara’s restructuring lets loss “escape” with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props. The leaf cylinder is set up, used, and paid off inside the same escalating loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Frost-light domes, vapor-breathing mountain, and the felt-lined cylinder create a micro-setting that literally constrains her fix; the crack in the floor seam forces her to brace and keep listening to the leaf. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through repairer’s gaze—brass lenses, shutter brass, gear teeth—never tourist catalog. Final image of Moon “bright as a scar” reweights earlier silver-flare obsession into earned poise. Environment and tool jointly enable the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture ephemeral flashes before dawn—faces concrete countdown; quake and spinning hand escalate by narrowing options beat-by-beat. One meaningful tightening: swapping electronic feedback for leaf ticks forecloses fallback tracking and spends her last spare seconds. Cost is legible: the rail alignment survives, but the lost windows and Lio’s absence remain irreversible. No coincidence resolves; her engineered governor earns the launch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: constancy must be built, not found; images outlast promises only when timing is wrested from chaos. Subtext lives in the leaf—organic fragility repurposed as metronome—recharging the father’s creed without stating it. Final “loss escape” reweights prior grief into quiet acceptance; no moralizing sentence. Ambiguity lingers: will the pod data redeem Lio? Complexity held, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors, gear prayers, sound of felt. Syntax lengthens under calm, fractures into staccato during jolts, mirroring quake rhythm. No head-hopping; diction stays within repairer lexicon. Leaf tick described as “soft tick the earthquake could not imitate” is idiosyncratic and memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the domes breathed slow vapor as if the mountain itself were thinking” sets tone and stakes simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each clause advances. Metaphors stay coherent—clock hand “like a trapped comet,” Moon “bright as a scar”—and culminate in closure image. Only micro-slip: “luminous ache of the shaking night” edges purple but reads as POV hyper-awareness under stress; doesn’t dull clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—lunar observatory, leaf governor, micrometeor hunt—feels fresh and inevitable; no trope checklist. Aspen-leaf-as-clock is specific, non-obvious, and grows from character craft. Risk taken: earthquake plus clock malfunction plus launch window could collapse into melodrama, yet causality holds. Transformation test fails if moved to generic lab; mountain, frost light, and rail are irreplaceable.</comment>
