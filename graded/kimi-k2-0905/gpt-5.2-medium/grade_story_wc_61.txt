<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lior’s exile motive and pocket-gear obsession are concrete early; the refusal to repeat parental paths drives every micro-choice (knot-tightening, moth-harness, final decision to stay on the outskirts). Interior contradiction—yearning for light yet fearing replication—remains embodied, not abstract. The caretaker exchange crystallizes cost: handing over the gear dims his personal beacon but seeds collective possibility, a renunciation legibly paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cool shared radiance reweights the premise—light without fire is possible, but only if many hands turn together, foreclosing Lior’s solitary hero path. Causal chain holds: gear → moth → grooves → automaton → diffused light; each step is motivated and irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“violet dust,” “starvines,” exile line). One minor scaffold: “he had sworn not to repeat them” repeats prior summary, but it does not touch the final image.</comment>

<comment>Nebula Garden is no backdrop: drifting petals meter narrative time, condensed-starlight wall blocks sight and forces sonar tactics, glassy-bark observatory supplies the decisive exchange. Gear-as-micro-setting constrains action—teeth must spin against stone to become map. Sensory triage favors touch and hearing under violet haze, matching POV’s trained engineer-sentimentalist bias. Spatial choreography is clean: moth flight, boulder dodge, wall approach, observatory entry track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break generational burning—surfaces in paragraph 1 and tightens when the caretaker warns that new light may erase discipline. Mid-story transit through sightless core is the single pressure spike: failure means eternal loop, success offers first alternative. Cost is visible: surrendering the gear leaves Lior personally dimmer, social risk explicit. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word window; no reversal, yet option space narrows decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated vegetal cycles and gear mechanics: inheritance can be re-tooled but never solo. Final image of children turning a shared wheel re-prices earlier solitude without moralizing. Subtextual hinge lies in the automaton’s tender face—machines can nurture while biological lineages scar. Ambiguity remains: diffuse light may still breed dependence, but the cost of trying is now communal, not filial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Lior; perceptual signature blends tactile precision (“reading return notes in his bones”) with lyrical sentiment (“each petal… a memory”). Syntax lengthens under emotional load, contracts during transit—pressure-responsive rhythm. No dialogue until caretaker scene; when it arrives, hushed register contrasts with prior sonic imagery, marking shift from isolation to negotiation. Reed-ping diction is consistent, never ventriloquizing modern tech jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “starvines coiled as their ancestors had” packs history and metaphor in five words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—gear-as-map, moth-as-engine, light-as-discipline—each revisited without contradiction. One paraphrase loop: “across the quiet sigh of falling petals” appears twice; second use reprises time marker and earns thematic echo, so penalty minimal. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“strained,” “carving,” “loosen”) propel motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of generational trauma with steampunk-astronomy imagery feels fresh; gear-driven star-mapping as metaphor for inherited scripts is non-obvious. Risk taken in quiet, anti-heroic closure—protagonist walks away from central glory—pays off by reconfiguring heroism as pedagogy. No derivative IP echoes; “observatory made of glassy bark” is singular. Concept commits fully: light without fire is both literal technology and ethical stance, pursued to last line.</comment>
