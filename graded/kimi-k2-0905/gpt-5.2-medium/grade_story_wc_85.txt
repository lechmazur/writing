<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt is embodied in the watch hand and her silence; the micro-choice to place it on the rail and confess earns the shift from eraser to witness. Jonah’s decision to leave the capsule unopened is credibly motivated by the ticking dream and the live confrontation with Mara. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the shared quiet at the end shows visible cost. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory summary just before the rail moment that slightly blunts the emotional spike.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mara kept the secret, she sells false memories; because she finds her surname on the driftwood, she must speak. The decisive change—Jonah pockets the unopened capsule and Mara offers the watch hand—lands with felt cost under the cobalt dusk. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. Closure is earned, not explained, and the persistent ticking constraint shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, bruised-ink sea, and wind-buffeted rail actively pressure the final confession; the watch hand and driftwood dolphin function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory selection narrows to salt air, ticking, and the grooved wood—details filtered through Mara’s guilt-sharpened attention. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies track from balustrade to rail to descending steps. The shore’s carvings evolve from archive to communal grave, reweighting the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara speak the withheld truth—tightens when the driftwood dolphin reveals her complicity. One meaningful escalation: the capsule moves from promised balm to potential lie, foreclosing the easy out. Cost is visible: Jonah pockets pain, Mara forfeits her eraser identity. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—collective complicity versus individual speech—emerges through the driftwood archive and the shared hush, never stated. The final image of returning the watch hand to the carvings reweights “sieved hush” from suppression to communal witness. Subtext lives in Jonah’s pocketed capsule and the unspoken ticking. No moralizing; the resonance is earned, though the earlier phrase “weight of withheld truth” flirts with echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s guilt-filtered perception; perceptual signature is vivid in “bruised ink” and “fish-bone thin.” Syntax lengthens under stress, then fractures in the short confession—rhythmic control mirrors emotional crest. No head-hopping; Jonah’s interiority surfaces only through gesture and dialogue indirection. The lyric compression—“sieved hush”—is taught early and paid off at the rail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long tidal sentences build, then clipped clauses at the reveal. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor stacking—and vehicles stay coherent (sea, mesh, ticking). One paraphrase loop around “weight of withheld truth” is the only minor scaffold. Information density is high; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: black-market genealogy plus driftwood archive plus manufactured memories yields a new angle on the found-family trope. The watch hand as both heirloom and evidence transforms a cliché into irreversible confession. Risk-taking in the lyric “sieved hush” pattern pays off by reconfiguring the communal lie into shared witness. Specificity of coastal whittled names makes the concept unswapable.</comment>
