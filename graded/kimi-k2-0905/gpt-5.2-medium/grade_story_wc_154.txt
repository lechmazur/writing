<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lani’s interior contradiction—professional composure versus private terror—grounds every micro-choice; the coral rub, the deliberate radio call, the final grafting metaphor all trace back to her need to convert shared fear into shared language. Mako’s “shrewdly innocent” smile is the only visible trait, but it lands as label-only; no embodied contradiction or cost is shown. The arm-cast archive is the crucible that forces her to act, so relationship-as-pressure is present even while the child sleeps. Closure is earned: she pays with the coral’s symbolic surrender and the ache in her voice, foreclosing the path of neutrality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: coral fragment → cast decryption → radio translation → stand-down order, each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“hospital’s water lilies”) and never wavers. The decisive change—vigil instead of revenge—is on-page, legible, and carries persistent cost: the coral left behind, the cast permanently inked with confessions. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; every object is tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass-roof twilight, pond mist, and ink-blotted plaster create a micro-setting that literally steers choice: the atrium is neutral ground where both sides will sign a child’s arm. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lani’s translator ear—footsteps “like a prayer,” graphite blur, lotus-hearted ache—never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: gurney, chair, pond edge, radio corner all hold their places. The coral fragment functions as portable setting; its ridges mirror the cast’s labyrinth, charging the final grafting image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent reprisal bloodbath—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the funeral/meeting false friend is decoded. One meaningful escalation: the discovery of the ambiguous phrase narrows options to either radio intervention or impending ambush; no second reversal needed. Protagonist agency drives every turn—rub coral, decrypt, call captain, call rebels—each action visibly raises personal exposure. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the talisman and accepts responsibility for any miscalculation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: a child’s broken arm becomes the only parchment both sides dare trust, so the body of the innocent is the text that can rewire war. Subtext lives in silence—tears swelling ink, radios going quiet, the final grafting metaphor left unexplained. No moralizing sentence; the candlelit vigil is the non-literal answer. Complexity remains: the reef is still blasted, the cast still scarred, meaning is grafted, not healed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lani’s perceptual signature—languages tasted as fear, coral ridges read as maps, “lotus-hearted ache” as tonal compass. No head-hopping; captain and liaison are heard only through her ear and radio static. Rhythm modulates: long liquid cadence for atrium calm, clipped naval phrases when decrypting. Diction stays within a translator’s lexicon without academic drift. Final image relinquishes metaphor to object, voice quieting into ache.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—coins, prayers, labyrinths—taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors; “reefs heal by grafting living polyps onto bleached stone” is precise biological diction that charges closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise is fresh: ceasefire negotiated via smudged autographs on a sleeping child’s plaster cast. The arm-as-archive transforms familiar war tropes into intimate archive, making the innocent body the text. Risk—lyric compression, multilingual wordplay—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Specificity of pidgin, naval English, and highland funeral homonym renders the concept irreplicable.</comment>
