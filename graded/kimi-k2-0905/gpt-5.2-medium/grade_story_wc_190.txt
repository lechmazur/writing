<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet vocation and tactile micro-choices (brake tap, collar meter check) embody a believable hierarchy of values; the interior contradiction between vigilance and vulnerability is shown, not told. Mara’s grief is rendered through embodied gesture (twisting the map) and shifts in attention rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—Mara stepping steady into wind after learning to “listen for the pauses”—carries visible cost in the transferred weight of silence. Interiority stays concrete; only the mother anecdote flirts with 20 % reflection cap yet it tilts present tactics, so the arc earns its stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s steadiness reconfigures the stake—silence now carries her forward—while the cold vial and rising wind make the cost undeniable. Causal linkage holds: storm-glass warning → brake → slower crossing → taught listening → earned exit. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“drifting prism terrace above the river yards”); no penalty. One reflective block (mother) stays under 20 % and primes Elias’s present brake choice. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The terrace’s colored panes, cable tension, and glass-bottomed car constrain every tactical choice Elias makes; the setting is not backdrop but control panel. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound levels, vibration, temperature drop) mirrors emotional stakes without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: catwalk, bay three, pulley, brake—bodies track. Weather shift is causally integrated, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elias slows the car to keep cables from “singing,” trading speed for psychological safety. One meaningful reversal: the storm-glass warning forces him to cede momentum, narrowing options to either creak (frighten Mara) or delay (risk wind). Cost is visible: longer exposure to gusts, colder ride, yet the choice forecloses Mara’s panic. Agency remains with operator; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of furnishing emptiness: silence as transit corridor. Subtext lives in gesture—teaching a girl to count pauses instead of thunder—never in thesis statements. Final image reweights the premise: silence is no longer absence but vehicle, a conceptual repricing paid for by shared cold seconds aloft. No moralizing sentence mars the exit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—decibel meter, crystal clump, cable note—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments when vial chills, mirroring wind tempo. Diction stays within operator lexicon; “catalyze calm” is the single elevated phrase, voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven: “We will keep it below forty” advances both tactic and reassurance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—needles, vaulted chamber—and pays off in final wind image without clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, character tool, and emotional filter (“He latched…felt the first duty…”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor alliteration (“vaulting hush”) reads intentional, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—orbital prism gondola as silence tutor—feels fresh yet inevitable, grounded in operator craft rather than gimmick. Storm-glass and decibel meter synthesize weather and emotion without steampunk ornament. Risk is taken: quiet arc replaces action set-piece, but coherence holds. Could not swap setting or tool without collapsing logic; specificity anchors universality of grief and comfort.</comment>
