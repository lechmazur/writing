<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina’s quiet obsession with the postcards and the night-bloom question is vivid and embodied; her decision to climb the transept window crystallizes her arc. Yet the interior contradiction between grief and wonder could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized. The final “tender dark” realization lands with cost, but the beat immediately before it feels slightly rushed, muting the emotional punch. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each postcard, garden observation, and glass layer thickens pattern until the map of vents reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her mother engineered safe nights—charged by the pressed-flower card and the etched moth. Cost is legible in the forehead pressed to cold stone and the new mural that must now shelter others. One transition (pavilion → cathedral) is clean; orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory triangulation—amber glass, sleet taps, night perfume—filters through Lina’s painter’s eye and guides her attention to the vents. The cathedral’s micro-climate is discovered via bodily movement and temperature shift, not exposition. The etched window functions as both map and memory, constraining the final revelation angle. Spatial choreography remains exact from cloister to transept stair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—tightens when each layer of glass reveals a mechanistic yet tender answer, foreclosing magical thinking. Pressure escalates through accumulating sensory evidence: moonlit stock, rising warm air, mother’s confession etched in stone. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is epistemic and emotional. The cost is the loss of mystique replaced by engineered gentleness, a bittersweet narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: engineered tenderness as inheritance. The night-bloom is both literal greenhouse effect and metaphor for maternal care—shelter built out of sight. Final image of the new mural reweights all prior postcards into a single act of reciprocation. No moralizing statement survives; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lina’s painterly perception: colors warm glasshouse, vines look like scratches on ice. Syntax lengthens during discovery then fractures into shorter units under emotional pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Free indirect style cleanly handles the mother’s etched note without slipping into omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “stone itself were exhaling perfume” performs double sensory duty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—vines as scratches, map as breath. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she began to reckon”) is forgivable at this length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse-cathedral micro-climate as love-letter is fresh; botanical palimpsest in window glass feels inevitable in hindsight. Postcards-as-map avoids twee sentiment by mechanical revelation. Risk lies in quiet epiphany rather than dramatic confrontation, but coherence justifies the choice. Could edge higher if the mother’s voice were less filtered through Lina’s reading.</comment>
