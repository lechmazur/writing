<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “warmly methodical” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—naming braid-strands aloud, steadying the lantern—so the final decision to publicize the treaty feels earned. Interior contradiction is light (anger → purpose) but lands via concrete action. The absence of on-page secondary characters keeps relationship pressure off the table; still, her stance crystallizes with visible cost. Meets 9- gate except for slight emotional reserve under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal summons door → unbraid rope → merge record → new text → public reading; each step tightens options. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the university’s forgotten guilt is now archivally indelible. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the final filing act forecloses denial.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Clock-tower mechanism room is tactile—oil smell, iron struts, listening pendulum—and constrains the braid-work that unlocks the door. Micro-setting (rope, seal, gears) functions as lived-in tools, not postcard scenery. Spatial choreography stays clean; lantern placement tracks. Environment charges the final image as the tower resumes “perfect time” now morally recalibrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore erased history—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: seal → door → faceless diplomat → revealed treaty → public filing; each beat narrows Mara’s options and raises institutional risk. Cost is legible: the university must confront its stolen river valley. Agency is archival, not physical, but still forces irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—absence as active, harmful presence—emerges through the gap-archive image and the reparative filing act. No moralizing; the public reading’s consequences linger off-page, inviting reflection. Subtext in the diplomat’s faceless silence reweights the seal’s red moon. Final image of “conscience given a door” offers resonant conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s archivist perceptual filter—cataloguing braids, noting dust, translating confusion. Rhythm mirrors methodical warmth: long calm sentences, punctuated by gear-clicks. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure. Diction remains within her professional lexicon; “merge” carries both archival and moral weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances gear, hand, or meaning. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“red moon” seal, “listening hush”—never clotted. Strong verbs (unweave, exhale, crystallize) propel without adverb clutter. Final line lands with cadence shift that signals closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantastical archive-of-absences feels fresh yet inevitable via braid-craft and diplomatic seal. Premise transforms “missing document” trope into institutional haunting. Risky choice to make climax a quiet filing act pays off because stakes are socially charged. Specificity of river-for-scholarship treaty roots novelty in lived injustice.</comment>
