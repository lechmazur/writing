<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s shrewd kindness is embodied through the locket reveal and her brokerage-funded envelopes; the contradictory mix of caution and exuberance is shown, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete (“felt cautious exuberance become steadier joy”). The final stance—accepting the looped mis-address as engine—earns its cost: she bankrolls an open-ended chain. Minor: the mother-backstory is a single beat, not a flaw, but keeps this just sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mistaken address returns, now embraced as perpetual motion, reweighting Mara’s earlier charity into an uncloseable circuit with financial and emotional cost. Causal chain holds: envelope → Eli → tuner → janitor → longshoreman → back to Mara; each because/therefore step is on-page. Orientation locked by line 5; single transition (pavilion→library) is legible. One tightening only, sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seaside fog, salt air, and “windows never fully shut” are filtered through Mara’s broker eye; the library roof deck constrains the proposal scene—open windows let wind flip pages, endorsing the plan. The envelope’s travel from concert seat to dunes to circulating chain is tracked without drift. No object or place is described unless it will carry the next beat. Micro-setting (the Unsung Hands box) literally holds the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make invisible labor audible—announced early; escalation occurs once when Mara commits commission money, narrowing her option to stop. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens: each thank-you obligates the next, costs accumulate (brokerage funds, anonymity surrendered). No reversal, but single tightening sufficient. Cost legible: open-ended financial drain and loss of control over the chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of acknowledged unseen labor emerges from the envelope’s wrong address and the mother-at-loom image; no character sermonizes. Final image—letter returns to Mara by mistake—reweights the premise: kindness becomes self-sustaining circuit rather than one-off gift. Subtext in Eli’s blush and wind-flipped pages shows approval without statement. Ambiguity remains: chain could grow or collapse, cost still accruing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual orbit: “she liked the place because…” selects salty breeze and smudged rosters. Syntax lengthens under feeling (“cautious and exuberant at once”) then tightens during proposal. No head-hopping; Eli’s interior accessed only via blush, laugh, admission—external cues Mara can see. Distinct maritime-commerce diction (“squeeze tariffs,” “longshoreman”) differentiates her voice from Eli’s softer librarian register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “the sea had learned to whisper words” does triple duty (setting, atmosphere, POV bias). No filler loops; each sentence advances chain or character. Figurative control maintained—metaphors (storm vs stranger, tidewater urge) stay maritime-consistent. Clean grammar, strong verbs, purposeful paragraph breaks. One hairline slip: “cautious exuberance” is repeated descriptor, but it is motif-linked, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Wrong-address-as-perpetual-engine feels fresh; combines familiar “pay it forward” with bureaucratic error, turning glitch into virtue. Maritime brokerage and backstage arts worlds rarely intersect—specificity prevents swap-test failure. Risk taken: no antagonist, no crisis spike, yet tension sustained by expanding obligation. Not quite 9 because concept could still travel to another port with cosmetic renaming.</comment>
