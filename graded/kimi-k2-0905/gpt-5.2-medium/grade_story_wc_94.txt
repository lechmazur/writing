<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet’s contradictory drives—rage at censorship versus gratitude for his father’s betrayal—are dramatized in the stalled exposure plate; the micro-choice to time, not photograph, scars crystallizes his renunciation of louder protest and costs him the clean moral high ground. Interiority stays embodied (“anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil, like rain that falls straight down”). The final stance—measured light instead of shouted poems—is earned through the timed-plate ritual and carries visible cost (the half-caught star as wound). Capped at 8.7 because the father’s off-page confession is delivered via envelope rather than dramatized choice, slightly blunting motivational torque.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet descends carrying fragile plates, resolved to fight censorship with “measured light,” a reconfiguration that reweights every prior stanza-blackout. The envelope-in-timetable reveal re-codes the father’s betrayal into coordinates of shared shame, paying off the opening image of the ticking timer. Causality holds: because the poet times each exposure to his breath-stutter, he produces an atlas of absences that forecloses traditional protest. Cost is legible in the final image—plates like “fragile oaths”—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first lightning flash to last.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is no postcard: wet domes “black as pearls,” the building “suspended as if the mountain had been cut free,” and the timer dial as “small altar” all constrain ritual action. The telescope, glass plate, and timer form a micro-setting triad that literally shapes the poet’s tactic—stop exposure mid-bloom. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, enter, load plate, snap dial. Environment charges the final image: dawn sky “scrubbed raw” mirrors the poet’s stripped stance. Meets 9+ gate: the timer/tool constrains the decisive choice and reappears in the closing metaphor of measured light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to name unnameable scars without reproducing violence—tightens when each timed exposure forces the poet to literalize his own wound-making. Escalation is textural: each aborted plate adds density to the atlas of absences, reweighting the cost of speech versus silence. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. The final refusal to “fight the censors with louder speech” narrows options to silent light, price paid in the half-caught star image. Could edge higher if one plate had cracked or been ruined, materializing stakes more viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—censorship as both wound and map—emerges through the recurring timer that converts duration into testimony. Subtext operates in gesture: Lysa’s “furiously tranquil” face mirrors the poet’s own emotional alloy, signaling complicity. The father’s timetable confession re-codes betrayal into cartography, refusing easy absolution. Final image reweights earlier blacked-out stanzas without moralizing: “measured light” is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: lightning reads as seam-revealer, star as wound, timer as insect-crawl. Syntax lengthens under emotional load—“anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil”—then fractures at climax: “a storm-kissed wonder that could not be neatly blacked out.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from external climb to internal plate-reading. Elision of father’s voice is purposeful, paid off by envelope reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence up the stairs, then staccato “snap the dial to zero.” Figurative density is high but patterned—pearl, altar, insect, wound—teaching the reader early and paying off in final “measured light.” No synonym loops or scaffold. One strained metaphor: “insect along a rim of light” is saved by tactile immediacy. Copy-clean except missing comma after “roof slit.” Artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of darkroom timer, censorship, and star-mapping feels inevitable yet fresh; no extant template matches this synthesis. Risk: lyric accumulative structure in under 800 words, but pattern is taught by line 5 and closure remains legible. Father’s betrayal-via-timetable re-codes mundane prop into emotional cartography. Transformation test fails if plates swapped for poems—timer and chemistry are essential. Bold, fully committed, no hedging.</comment>
