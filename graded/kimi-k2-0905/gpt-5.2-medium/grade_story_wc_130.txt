<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lysa’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “tenderly furious” stance and reed-toy memory give her a tactile mind. The contradiction between conjurer’s proof-demand and sisterly ache drives every beat; the final renunciation—accepting the unretrievable—pays off prior causality. Micro-choices (placing eyes, repairing tile) externalize hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; solo arc still earns high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the repaired quartz tile and buried optimism reweight ambiguous loss into livable continuum, cost felt in the un-crossed bridge. Causal linkage holds—each step from mosaic decoding to ladder-bridge is because/therefore, no retro-patching. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“cavern breathed”), well inside 120-word window. One scene, single POV, one meaningful tightening at thirteen-drop; scope defaults met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Calcite trees, dripping stalactites, and fox-eye lenses are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lysa’s taxonomic gaze. The orchard’s spatial choreography stays coherent—ladder, mosaic, seam tracked without drift. Micro-setting (quartz shard) directly charges final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and world rules remain consistent; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Orren—signaled in first 150 words; pressure tightens when the thirteen-drop sequence forecloses retreat. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she decodes, speaks lullaby, builds bridge, accepts non-return. Cost legible in “buried optimism” and repaired tile—permanent constraint accepted. No external antagonist needed; internal math vs. grief sufficient for 600-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: love’s calculus can balance without solving. Subtext operates through silence—Orren’s unanswered question and Lysa’s lullaby landing like “new tiles.” Final image reframes prior motifs (quartz, ladder, mosaic) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers, but emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual signature—patterns, numbers, reed-memory. Syntax mirrors her patient inventiveness: long rhythmic sentences that “count” breaths. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal voice remains coherent and un-filter-verb heavy. Compression (“thin seam of light”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language patterned (triangles, coordinates, bridge) without purple overload. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) justified by conjurer’s mindset. One near-mixed metaphor (“heart like scattered seeds” vs. “dovetail”) but clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomantic orchard, taxidermist eyes, and emotional mathematics feels non-obvious and inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in charged poise rather than plot twist. Specific detail (fox unnamed, pear of quartz) prevents trope drift. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—core freshness secured.</comment>
