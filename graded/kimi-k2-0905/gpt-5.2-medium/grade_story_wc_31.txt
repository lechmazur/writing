<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lamplighter’s private vow to “discover the color of sound” is a vivid, idiosyncratic want that seeds every beat; the underwater vow to “hear without wanting” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays embodied (“notes seemed to brush my eyes with pale green”) and avoids label-speak. The single POV keeps pressure tight; no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only bar to 9+ is that the interior contradiction—truth as shield vs. lens—remains more asserted than dramatized in a second beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing vow card reweights the premise—honesty becomes receptor, not armor—while the fading lantern-sparks overhead charge the image with undeniable opportunity cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each luminous object (tag, registry, vow) tightens the pattern until the final violet bell-bloom. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“late-shift pier lamplighter”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the drive holds from first match to last spark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pier, the sunken library, and the lanterned sky form a telescoping micro-macro set that actively constrains choice: the ladder descent literally forecloses retreat, the silt-furred shelves supply the only usable vow cards, and the porthole frame becomes the lens through which the final repricing is seen. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—sound-color synesthesia filters every cue. Spatial choreography is clean: tag found under Pier Nine, slot found in registry drawer, card pocketed on exit. Environment charges the final image; without the porthole’s framed sky the cost would be illegible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“see sound’s color”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through two causal tightenings: (1) tag unlocks registry, (2) vow card unlocks perception. Each narrows options: once the vow is spoken, the old “hiding behind truth” tactic is foreclosed. Cost is visible: the last lanterns fade to “sparks” while the narrator’s air runs low, linking sensory gift to mortal limitation. Pressure is coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of possessing perception without surrendering control. Subtext resides in the act of lighting others’ lamps while finally accepting one’s own unlit remainder. The final image—walking the pier “so other people could find their own colors”—offers resonant, non-moral reconfiguration. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a synesthetic perceptual signature that stays consistent: sound is color, applause is “silver rain.” Rhythm modulates from long sea-swell sentences topside to shorter, breath-tight clauses underwater. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Patterned elision (“by wandering purposefully”) is taught early and paid off at descent. One hairline slip: “truth could be turned inside out” edges toward aphorism, but the next sentence re-anchors it to the vow card.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence openings, and metaphors that obey internal physics (“curtains that waved like tired flags”). Figurative language is selective; no purple stacking in the climax. Copy is clean. The only micro-trace of scaffold is the repeated “I” anaphora in the final paragraph, but it serves as breath-beat under rising water pressure and thus reads intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic lamplighter who dives to a phosphorescent library to trade honesty for perception is a fresh synthesis; no familiar template maps cleanly onto it. The Meridian tag’s evolution from talisman to key to covenant shows transformation, not ornament. Risky underwater library setting is fully committed to, not retreated from. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Minor proximity to “lantern festival” tropes is transcended by the color-of-sound concept.</comment>
