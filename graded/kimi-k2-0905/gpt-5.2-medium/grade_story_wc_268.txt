<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orun’s “regally unpretentious” stance is dramatized in the refusal of the crown—an earned renunciation that costs him personal power and keeps him in the archive identity. The interior contradiction between titanic strength and gentle smile is shown through the careful heave that “honored the old artisans,” not declared. One slip: the moment he copies the ledger is summarized, so the micro-choice that seals his exposure of the pretender is slightly off-stage; this keeps him just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: pellet → rune → drift → sealed chamber → sundered star → scroll → ledger copy → public unmasking. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the library collapses as he writes, the pellet is consumed, and the drift rune expires—so the price is on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ancient temple library”), well under the 120-word threshold. Lens holds causal throughout; no late convenience breaks the linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cracked basalt roof, ash librarians, and loosened-braid vines are not scenery—they gate access, mark time strata, and supply the final mosaic key. The iron pellet itself becomes a micro-setting whose dwindling weight signals the ticking cost. Environment directly constrains the climax: only the sundered star-tile reveals the scroll. Meets the 9+ gate: the mosaic tile object charges the final image and forecloses the pretender’s cosmic claim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the usurper’s forgery—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the pellet’s ink supply becomes finite; each copied line reduces future options. The meaningful turn occurs when Orun chooses to sacrifice the pellet—and the library’s temporal sanctuary—to complete the ledger copy, trading secrecy for actionable evidence. Cost is visible: “the ink pellet dwindling to nothing.” Slight reserve: the court’s immediate acceptance feels abrupt, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth is archived, not crowned—emerges through the succession scroll hidden inside a fake star; the final image of Orun walking back toward “ruins” reweights monarchy itself as a fragile annotation. Subtextual irony: the smallest titan topples a regime by tending text rather than wielding force. No moralizing line states the thesis; the mosaic shard at the usurper’s feet is the silent argument. Complexity remains: the real heir is still absent, inviting future instability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-archival: “dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers” marries physical observation to institutional decay. Syntax lengthens during drift-time, then compresses at the sunder moment, mirroring temporal viscosity. Diction stays within a scholarly lexicon without academic affectation. Perceptual signature is consistent—Orun notices marginalia, ink weight, tile seams—and never drifts into omniscient tour-guide mode.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “heavens above the broken oculus paused, constellations shifting so slowly that an hour became a season” performs world-rule exposition inside a sensory beat. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed vehicle—“vines hung like loosened braids”—is minor against the sustained control. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors collapsing shelves without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy archive-heist is fresh, yet the core risk—using astrological forgery as legal proof—feels inevitable once the mosaic star is introduced. The drift rune rewrites time inside a library, a synthesis of Borges and clock-punk that avoids generic spellcasting. Refusing the crown converts a standard victory arc into archivist ethic, a non-obvious but earned stance. Specificity of the iron gall ink as both tool and evidence weaponizes craft itself, not a detachable MacGuffin.</comment>
