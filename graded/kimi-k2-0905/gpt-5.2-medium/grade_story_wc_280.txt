<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s synesthetic curse is made visceral—“tinny blue applause” on her tongue—so every later sensory crossover feels earned; her decision to speak her father’s name into the stage is the micro-choice that finally pays the cost of keeping the coin. The ghost’s hunger is sketched more than dramatized—he never risks anything tangible—so the relational crucible is one-sided, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the coin pressed to wood, the single merged applause, and the garden locking into one era reconfigure both timelines with undeniable conceptual cost—Mara now inherits a future she can rent. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the echo-game (because) tightens the fracture until her father’s name (therefore) stitches it; no off-stage cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coin’s warming copper and the apples’ “polished look of photographs” are tactile anchors that charge the final image; the garden’s two moons and shifting jazz date-stamps teach the fracture pattern early. Spatial choreography stays clean through the hedge maze and stage center, satisfying the 9+ gate that the object/environment constrains the closing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“possibility from the brink of despair” keyed to rent—tightens when Mara realizes the fracture itself is the antagonist holding Silas hostage; her choice to finish his trick forecloses the loophole of endless replays and costs her the nostalgic orchard as a private refuge. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price is legible in the merged applause that evicts the ghost and locks her into sole stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: unfinished art can trap both artist and caretaker, and nostalgia is only useful when spent, not hoarded. The final image of apples shining like photographs reweights the earlier “tinny blue” taste into a usable past rather than an affliction, achieving resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person stays latched to Mara’s synesthetic filter—“green velvet” air, “bitter orange” flash—so every clause carries her perceptual signature; no head-hopping. The lyric compression (“sequins...turned from gray to gold”) is taught by the earlier color-taste crossovers and pays off in the closure beat, satisfying 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussion (“She flipped the coin”) to longer braided clauses that mimic echoing; no loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“patient hunger of an encore-seeking stage ghost”—is forgiven because it fuses Silas’s need with the garden’s appetite, and the closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic caretaker + ghost locked in a fractured orchard maze is a fresh synthesis; the tarot coin as both lock-pick and applause-trigger transforms a prop into a temporal stitch. Risk—letting the garden stabilize off-stage while Mara walks away—pays off because the cost (she now faces real-world rent alone) is undeniable.</comment>
