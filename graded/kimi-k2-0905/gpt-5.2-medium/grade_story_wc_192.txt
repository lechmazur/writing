<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her ritual severings, scar-naming, and final choice to let Lio inhale through her wounds all feel earned. The contradiction between her self-imposed exile and the need to re-connect is dramatized, not declared. One minor slip: Lio’s shadow-form never quite acquires independent desire, so the relationship crucible cools a notch before the final breath. Still, her loaded emptiness turns from poison to porous lung on the page, meeting the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rebuilt bridge is not a reunion but a one-way exhalation back to life, cost paid by the reopened scars. Causal chain holds—each scar-named memory tightens the seam until the final strike of the ring re-mortars the threshold. Orientation is taught early by tactile anchors (warm iron, soot walls). No lens ambiguity; the accumulative pattern of scar-doors → breath is legible and resonant.</comment>

<comment>The charcoal chapel is no backdrop: its ashen walls rub black under finger-pressure, the warm doorknocker skins memory, and the starlight spill physically floods the sanctuary at climax. Micro-setting—the ridged scars on Mara’s arms—literally becomes the door Lio must pass through. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating knees or impossible distances. Environment constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the threshold sealed or drown in outside grief”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lio’s choking shadow appears. One meaningful deepening: Mara must reopen her own severed lines to pay the toll, foreclosing her clean exile. Cost is visible: reopened scars, kneeling imprint in ash, and the final soft door-closed acceptance that the next ring will come. Escalation is accumulative but unmistakably driven by her agency under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of deliberate distance becoming the only gift you can give: severance as salvage. No moralizing—final image of “loaded emptiness no longer poison” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext lives in gesture: the underwater bell-chime of a ring no wind moved. The scars shift from shame-lit doors to shared airway, a resonant reconfiguration that invites counter-readings on self-harm as cartography of care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: soot, iron warmth, panic “like a thin mean thread.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath—note the caesura in “pain named, breath taken, pain named again.” No head-hop; Lio’s interior is accessed only through the tactile relay of scar ridges, preserving distance. Voice modulation under peak stress is controlled, earning high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet breathable: “starlight spilled into the chapel like water into a sinking boat” does triple duty (image, stakes, foreshadow). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. One near-mixed metaphor—“wet ash through cracks”—is forgiven because ash is already established as tactile wall matter. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted dawn, sealing momentum cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of burned bridges rebuilt as one-way airway feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the ghost at the door is not revenge but suffocated need. Scar-as-door is a fresh inflection on wound trope, made specific through ritual naming and iron resonance. Risk—using lyric compression inside gothic fabulism—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap scars for letters or photos and the entire breath-transport logic collapses.</comment>
