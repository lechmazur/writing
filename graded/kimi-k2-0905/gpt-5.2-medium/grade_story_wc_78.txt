<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leeward’s “translate disaster into music” drive is concrete and embodied; every tap of the mallet is a micro-choice that alters crew tactics. Interiority stays sensory—salt pears, bell-buoy clang—never sliding into label-speak. The final tar-repair of the mallet shows cost scaled to length, earning a credible endurance rather than epiphany. What keeps the score sub-9 is the absence of a contradictory impulse tested in scene; risk is externalized, so the arc is steady rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sailcloth fractal path is legible, reconfigures options, and carries conceptual cost—prophecy needs harmony to move people. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each percussive layer tightens the driftwood circle’s density until the storm’s own thunder becomes the mirrored instrument that saves them. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “orchard floated alone,” so no penalty applies. A hairline slip: the freighter’s horn alteration feels slightly exogenous, but because the mirrored pattern precedes it, the beat still reads as earned resonance rather than coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not postcard exotic; its kelp-rooted trunks and iron bell buoy supply the very materials that become the orchestra, constraining every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Leeward notices cloud notes before color, barrels before pears—keeping description purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the squall: spar arcs, ropes catch, bell hammered in wind-time. Micro-setting (the cracked chest, tarred mallet head) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; only the slightest over-adorning of “bruise” for sky keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—physical survival of the driftwood circle—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the freighter light appears. Escalation is textural: each new percussive layer increases density until the storm itself supplies the final instrument; options narrow from “nets vs noise” to “mirror or die.” The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; even the loose spar is converted into a giant beater. Cost is visible—fruit lost, spar dents, tar spent—though the price is collective rather than personal, keeping the score just below the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: pattern recognition as communal survival, music as negotiated reality. Subtext lives in gesture—offering the mallet and sailcloth to fishermen is tacit admission that prophecy needs audience. The final image of tar being smeared on the mallet reweights “restless euphony” into maintenance, not transcendence. No moralizing line intrudes; the only drag is a near-echo of “translate disaster into music” that flirts with thesis but is saved by its placement mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leeward’s perceptual signature—clouds as notation, salt pears as drumheads—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and contracts with wind gusts, creating a readable score on the page. Diction stays within a weather-reader’s lexicon; no corporate register leaks. The single line of dialogue (“did not claim the sea obeyed him”) is indirection, not exposition, preserving voice purity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathless clauses during the squall to staccato taps of barrel-bell beats. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensorial data, tactical consequence, and metaphoric echo. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each percussive noun (knock, ring, thud) is distinct. A single mixed metaphor—“conductor without an orchestra”—is allowed because it is taught early and paid off when the crew becomes his ensemble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The floating kelp-orchard orchestra is a bold, fully committed premise; risk heightens stakes rather than gimmickry. Tropes of maritime disaster and prophet-seer are transformed through acoustic engineering: the reef-torn anchor line becomes a tuning opportunity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—every physical object has a resonant frequency that can be mapped. Specificity of tarred mallet repair and fractal sailcloth keeps the concept grounded, earning the extra +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
