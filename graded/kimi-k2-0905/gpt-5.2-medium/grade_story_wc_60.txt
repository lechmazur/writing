<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—scientific doubt versus empathetic compulsion—are dramatized in the moment she stops forcing the latch and listens; the final choice to carry the light back is earned by the revealed maternal connection and costs her the shelter of forgetting. Interiority is concrete, body-bound (“box warm with her light”), and avoids label-speak. One decimal off 8.8 only because the mother reveal is a single beat; we don’t see the prior relationship under pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lost memory → accept commission → breadcrumb trail → mechanical map → release → maternal origin → decision to restore. Closure is a Decisive Change: the city’s memories are freed and Mara’s doubt is permanently re-weighted; cost is the ache she now must share. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. No teleporting props or soft resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Dry basins held only chalky moons” and limescale chips as breadcrumbs fuse setting with action; the maintenance door’s “cold smell of wet stone” directly enables the hinge test. The forgotten fountain engines constrain her final mechanical alignment of box to map. Micro-setting (the box’s star-pane constellation) charges the closing image. One hairline slip from 9.0: spatial choreography inside the underground hall is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the latch refuses force; the micro-turn “unstick is not only force but release” narrows her options to stillness under the inferred causal lens. Price is legible: she inherits the pain she once escaped. No coincidence resolves; the mother’s authorship complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s cost emerges through limescale crumbs, sidereal waiting, and the final image of glowing doubt carried back—no explicit thesis. The mother’s inverted love—erasing to protect—creates resonant ambiguity. Final reweighting: remembering becomes the braver, bleaker duty. No moralizing sentence tacked on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature: “practiced doubt,” “sidereal patience,” “realistically imaginative.” Syntax lengthens during waiting, shortens during click—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One microscopic slip: “rehearsing” for water memory is slightly writerly, not mechanic-Mara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “lantern light seemed to bend toward her yet she refused every easy story” advances both world and character. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (constellation map = valve code). One clause—“the whole city listened”—is mild hyperbole, but within lyrical license. Closure image is uncluttered and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Forgotten fountains whose calcified shards become star-mapped breadcrumbs is fresh; sidereal patience as a mechanic’s virtue reweights astrological trope. Mother-as-secret-archivist twist is seeded by “defiant hush” and Mara’s blurred childhood, not conjured late. Risky compression to 750 words succeeds without causal skimming. Loses 0.3 because the geese pause, while lovely, is not fully differentiated from other “silent city” tropes.</comment>
