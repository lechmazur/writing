<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied deafness, her cane-time literacy, and her classroom numbness are concrete; the decision to “score the record while it reverses” crystallizes her hierarchy of values (children’s feeling > her own safety). The Listener scene supplies external pressure, but the internal contradiction—she destroys the parasite by intensifying the very silence she fears—lands with visible cost: the snapped filament dusts her palm and the cavern’s hush becomes breathable again. One hairline slip: “emotional numbness she could not name” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, though it’s immediately re-anchored in physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the needle snapped, the filament fed; because Mara reverses the groove and scores it, the parasite starves and the Listener retreats. Orientation is clean by line 4 (who, quarry path, when = season shift). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s returning echo re-prices silence itself as pliable material, and Mara pockets the now-inert needle—persistent constraint that will remind her forward is earned by backward motion. Cost is legible in the stinging heat she feels in her ribs as each scratch bleeds sound back into the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s acoustic anatomy—dripping hush, mirrored echo, stone that drinks vibration—functions as both environment and tool, directly constraining tactics: Mara must conduct through the wall to re-introduce resonance. The antique phonograph’s brass horn and snapped needle act as micro-setting that charges the final image when the scored record becomes a blade. One minor drift: “seasons outside turning from dry to wet in a single scented breeze” edges toward atmospheric shorthand, but it’s brief and serves as causal confirmation that the filament has snapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim feeling from the parasite—tightens when the Listener appears and Mara realizes the filament is feeding on unattended sorrow. Agency is continuous: she chooses reversal, then chooses to scar the groove, each act narrowing options and raising physical cost (heat in ribs, dust on palm). The final beat forecloses the path of passive silence; the cavern now returns echo, and Mara’s classroom future is re-opened yet remains fragile—felt price without tidy victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the malleability of silence: what swallows can be sculpted. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s signed command to Kerrin, the salamander-like Listener’s glassy eyes—never declared. The ending reweights the premise: silence is not absence but material that can be carved backward into feeling. No moralizing; the pocketed broken needle is the quiet conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s tactile cognition; perceptions are filtered through cane taps, floor vibrations, fingertip threads. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“vibrations skitter like startled mice”—then fractures with the scoring beats, mirroring the reversal. No head-hopping; Kerrin’s drum enters only as observed vibration. One clause drifts toward elevated register—“conceptual repricing” risk in narration—but the bulk stays within a deaf teacher’s sensory lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid cadence to staccato under stress; no template churn. Metaphors are spare and physically grounded: “breath held too long,” “gray pollen.” Information density is high—each sentence advances stakes or texture. Zero paraphrase loops; the single potential scaffold—“the same blank stare from her students and from herself”—is justified as iterative symptom of the parasite.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing deaf protagonist with inverted phonograph to externalize emotional anesthesia is fresh; the Listener as pale salamander gardener of hush feels mythic yet earned. Risk is taken in making silence a parasitic filament, and the payoff sticks. The concept is specific to this voice and geology; swap Mara’s cane for hearing and the entire mechanism collapses.</comment>
