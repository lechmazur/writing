<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily rich and character-specific; the taste-listening trick and glow-ink anchor a memorable perceptual signature. Motive pulses steadily—grandmother-shaped absence—until the circle invitation where cost becomes legible through sensory shift (iron→bread) and ring settling. Still, the choice to join is reported more than dramatized; micro-choice under live opposition is missing, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the converged dome and grandmother-laugh in sleet-mist reweight the premise under an Accumulative lens—density, not cause, drives meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) appear by word 70; no orientation penalty. One causal gap: why Bureau-raised skeptic expects safe reception is elided, but the final image bears undeniable conceptual cost (glow now yoked to collective risk), satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lavender terraces, basalt cliffs, and slow green aurora are selective, tactile, and filtered through gust-tasting POV. The tin ring serves as micro-setting that constrains direction and final stance. Spatial choreography across the bluff is clean; bodies circle without drift. Weather-as-atmosphere mirrors internal charge without overt symbol, meeting the 9+ gate of environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will I surrender inherited doubt to share a sky?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once as ring-pull strengthens and Bureau risk is voiced; convergence is the single deepening that forecloses neutrality. Cost is felt in sensory shift and glow co-opted, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no new obstacle or trade-off complicates the middle, keeping it short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance versus agency in collective climates—emerges through taste, ring, and vote-without-ballot imagery; no authorial thesis stated. Grandmother’s laughter inside converged sleet offers resonant non-literal answer: memory can steward futures if released from ownership. Ambiguity lingers about Bureau reprisal, yet the reconfiguration is legible. Almost no frictional signs; a hairline dip because thematic question is named once in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a luminous, skeptical perceptual signature—ionic air, citrus-to-iron arc—maintained without filter-verb clutter. Syntax modulates from long aurora ribbons to clipped “I should have refused” under pressure. No dialogue contamination; Thundercloud Hair’s single line carries subtext and stakes. Compression and elision are taught early (“listen right”) and paid off at closure, satisfying 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned (taste, metal, weather) and tied to POV; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—slow ribbons, then hard stop of ring settling. One paraphrase loop (“converge” twice in four lines) and a buried lead mid-paragraph are minor scaffolds. No artifacts touch the final image; clarity and propulsion remain strong, though not pristine enough for 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Electoral forests and hereditary microclimates synthesize climate-SF with tender familial haunt; neither trope feels stock. Emergent compass-as-agreement rather than direction refreshes the magnet trope. Transformation test fails only if weather-carrier culture is swapped out, proving specificity. Risk in lyric Accumulation structure heightens resonance without gimmickry, meriting the upper band.</comment>
