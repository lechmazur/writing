<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “discerning curator” eye anchors every beat: she notices the locket’s weight, hears the mailbox clink, chooses not to sell. Interiority stays sensory and job-colored; the final clasping of the locket is a micro-choice that visibly pays the story’s cost. No contradictions, no therapy-speak. Secondary voices are flat but off-stage; single-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: locket photo → brick seam → hidden keyhole → mailbox opens → readings reroute eviction pressure. Closure is Earned Stasis—Mara forecloses profit, keeps the locket, neighborhood holds—cost felt in the developer truck idling outside. Orientation anchored by line 5; no lens drift. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard objects (murals, basil, fountain brick) are filtered through curator gaze and double as clues; the brick seam literally guides the final key turn. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over postcard visuals. Space stays coherent as bodies gather around the mailbox. Environment constrains the climax: the courtyard’s physical layout hides the lock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can listening forestall displacement?—is signaled early and tightened when letters are read aloud, freezing the developer outside. Agency is attention, not combat; it still forecloses the “sell and leave” path. One meaningful escalation suffices. Cost is legible: private grief aired in public, external threat paused not vanished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulated apologies: communal listening as fragile resistance to erasure. No moralizing; the final line is image, not thesis. Subtext lives in unopened envelopes left unread—silence still owns space. Irony: the mailbox delayed connection until the neighborhood could hold itself—reweights the blackout mythos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries curator precision: “tarnished, aged locket,” “hinge resisted my thumb.” Rhythm modulates—long reflective curls tighten into short clicks at keyhole moment. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly Mara-bound. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence. Information often doubled (synonym pairs like “nowhere and everywhere”) but compressed enough to avoid drag. Metaphors stay physical and consistent. One paraphrase loop (“listening heals”) is institutional tagline, not peak-beat clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Locked-apology-mailbox trope is refreshed by curator procedural and micro-keyhole engineering. Accumulated testimonies replace single twist. Risk: quiet resistance instead of heroic save—stakes stay neighborhood-scaled, developer still idling. Specificity of thrift-curator gaze prevents generic “community saves itself” template.</comment>
