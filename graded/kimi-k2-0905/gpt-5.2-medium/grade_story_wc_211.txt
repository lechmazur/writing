<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Erem’s vocation and private obsession are cleanly fused; the heartbeat-in-wax discovery triggers an immediate, credible shift from archivist to actor. Interiority stays concrete—his tongue “vibrates like an instrument,” his terror is the felt weight of “sworn the city into failure.” The final act—broadcasting in dead vow-tongue—pays off earlier linguistic set-up and costs him institutional cover, an earned stasis. Only minor: we don’t see how this secrecy will haunt him beyond tonight, so the cost, while visible, could bite deeper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s disaster is averted but the true archive becomes the emotional pattern Erem refuses to let recur. Causal chain intact—wax heard → grief decoded → warning broadcast → grid saved—each beat narrows his options and raises reputational cost. Orientation crisp within 120 words: tower orchard, dusk, phonograph on stone table. No lens ambiguity; the lyric accumulative texture feeds the final reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass-encased orchard is not scenery but instrument: its “depth of silence” enables the hearing, its roof intercoms enable the rescue. Micro-setting—cedar box, stylus, dark soil paths—constrains handling of the fragile wax and dictates the pacing of the ritual. Sensory hierarchy obeys Erem’s archivist bias: smell of smoke, tremor of paper, heartbeat in wax. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image of the ribbon stored “beside his oath books,” a fused archive of feeling and law.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the accidental prophecy claim lives—surfaces the moment the heartbeat is heard. Pressure tightens once: hearing the lullaby → realizing it forecasts grid failure → deciding to break secrecy. The broadcast empties elevators, turning prophecy into preventive record; the cost is Erem’s exposure as rogue scribe. One meaningful escalation suffices; coincidence (the lullaby’s date match) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: archives are not neutral; to record is to intervene. The story refuses a moral—salvation carries “soft unease of saved lives,” a resonant reconfiguration. Subtext lives in gesture: the city’s “breathing” and towers “leaning” mirror Erem’s own eavesdropping dread. No thematic echo; final line’s “truest contract is what we refuse to let happen” is earned through the prior causal arc, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Erem’s shoulder, filtering perception through his professional sensorium: languages tasted as “reflex,” sound smelled as smoke. Syntax lengthens and compresses with the phonograph’s rasp, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely in weighted description; diction stays within a scribe’s lexicon without sliding into faux-archaic. The velvet disquiet is maintained through rhythmic control and selective sensory detail, modulating into the final hush of the cedar box.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do double duty—advance plot while layering metaphor (“the wax kept the pattern like a bruise”). No scaffold or synonym loops; each image is bespoke. One mixed metaphor—“velvet disquiet… gathers in the leaves as if the trees are eavesdropping”—but it is purposeful personification, not slippage. Opening and closing lines frame the arc with sonic imagery, giving the piece a read-aloud cadence that justifies its lyric density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—phonograph shaving as accidental prophecy—feels fresh yet inevitable in a world where oaths are archived in dead tongues. Risk: lyric accumulative structure instead of conventional plot reversals, but pattern is taught early and pays off in the final reweighting. Specificity of municipal registry, glass orchard, and vow-tongue broadcast prevents generic port-city noir. Transformation test passes: swap any detail and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
