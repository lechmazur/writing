<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific (“salt in my lungs,” “porous for disbelief”) and embodied; the insomnia fuels the porous credulity that lets the compass vision land. Yet the decisive exchange of brooches feels lightly motivated—no prior beat shows the painter valuing future art over the sister relic; the renunciation cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Relationship with Mara stays observational; no status shift or mutual risk tests the protagonist’s hierarchy of values. Still, the flaw-driven mistake (trading away the clear brooch) compounds and is accepted, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sister loss → brooch quest → rain trails → compass → exchange. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: he trades the intact brooch for the map/vision, loses the sister talisman forever—“clasp bite like a promise” makes cost legible. One minor causality slip: the oiled paper map appears exactly when needed with no prior seed, but it complicates rather than rescues, so tolerated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brinehook’s tidal causeway, ruined chapel, and sinkhole are tactile and selective; rain trails function as both setting and plot engine, constraining route choices. The cracked baptismal font and brackish reeds mirror the haggard awe tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and tools track across the chapel floor and sinkhole rim. Environment does not yet constrain the final image enough for 9+, but the cold mineral exhale of the sinkhole charges the compass activation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost sister memory vs. need for new artistic direction—is signaled early and tightens when the compass offers vision at the price of the remaining brooch. The single escalation beat (exchange) forecloses retrieval of sister relic, paying visible cost. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no fake intensifiers. Could use one earlier obstacle or tactical loss to push into 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “trading grief for direction” emerges through the compass transaction rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: clasp bite = promise of irretrievable loss. Final image reweights the amber: once souvenir, now currency for art-meaning, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will visions sustain him?—but complexity feels genuine, not equivocal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice carries distinct painterly perceptual signature—“sky looked like a bruise that would not heal,” “rain ran toward what wanted to be found.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under action; no template cadence. Dialogue is sparse yet natural; Mara’s “you paint, don’t you” conveys haggard awe without ventriloquism. No head-hopping or register drift; psych distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; strong verbs (“breathed,” “thresh,” “exhaled”) replace modifiers. Occasional poetic layering (“gray hour before dawn,” “skin of retreating water”) but never clogs causality. One paraphrase loop: “rain trails…led me…following rain trails again” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphor; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-climate-collapsequest for memory-technology feels fresh, but amber brooch as psychic key flirts with familiar trope; grounding in rainwater cartography and tidal mechanics particularizes it. Rain-as-guide reverses usual survival trope, making ruin proactive. Risk-taking lies in quiet, non-violent climax—exchange rather than showdown—and lands cleanly. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ but avoids derivative defaults.</comment>
