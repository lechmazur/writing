<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—fear of exposure vs. need to protect Eli—play out in concrete micro-choices (hiding the lens, copying doodles, finally signing her name). The final gesture of transparency costs her institutional safety and is fully earned. Interiority stays embodied and specific; no diagnostic self-labeling. One hairline slip: “secrecy manufactures suspicion” is a touch abstract for peak beat, but immediately grounded by the lens-offering action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage (lens found → hidden → doodles traced → route decoded → lens returned → ledger signed). Closure is a Decisive Change: Mara forecloses her own secrecy, visible cost is her name on public evidence. Orientation clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One persistent constraint—the stolen lens—shapes every tactical choice until relinquished.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crushed-crystal forecourt, ticket graphite, and lens optics are tactile, selective, and filter through Mara’s registrar gaze. The micro-setting of the ledger and lamp constrains the discovery beat; the forecourt’s whispering stones charge the final communal thaw. No sensory checklist; weather affects action (steam at dawn mirrors thaw). Spatial choreography tracked cleanly from forecourt to office to projector room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—institutional trust vs. personal safety—tightens once the split-circle route points to Mara’s own window, forcing a public choice. Escalation is causal: each doodle copy narrows her options until silence becomes complicity. Visible price: she sacrifices anonymity by signing the ledger. No coincidence; the final revelation is triggered by her own lens-return gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—secrecy breeds suspicion, transparency dissolves it—emerges through the lens-and-doodle pattern, never stated. Final image of tickets and lens “transparently arranged” reweights prior material with conceptual cost: openness is now institutional policy. No moralizing line; resonance is imagistic. Ambiguity remains: board could still punish, but the thematic question has been answered by the shared act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual quirks—ledger numbers, lamp glare, graphite smudges. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into short beats when she lifts the lens. No head-hopping; Eli’s interior accessed only via his drawn eye. Register consistent: conservatory diction without jargon drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Figurative language sparse and precise—“sheet of crushed crystal,” “ghostly images that could not hide”—never clogs the climax. Strong verbs (gleamed, whispered, sharpened) replace modifiers. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer cadence for surveillance, staccato for revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silent-concert world plus doodle cryptography feels fresh yet inevitable. The lens-as-magnifier twist reweights the sabotage premise without retroactive patch. Risk taken: no spoken dialogue, yet communication beats are vivid. Could swap deaf-inclusion subplot into any setting, but the specific silence-culture and registrar POV make this iteration memorable.</comment>
