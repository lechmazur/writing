<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulse—wanting scars to speak yet forcing them open—drives every beat; the final legible wound is earned by her successive choices to worsen the seam. Interiority stays concrete (“pain quieting to a distant pulse”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choices (flipping the hourglass, prying stones, reopening stitches) externalize the hierarchy: neighborhood healing > personal closure. Only the telepathy gift feels externally bestowed, not mined from flaw, keeping her from full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scar becomes text, the miracle returned, cost paid in reopened flesh and permanent mark. Causal chain (ivy memory → tunnel → pour light → wound legible) holds without gaps; each flip of the hourglass tightens stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. One shard, single POV, within scope; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Body-as-setting rules: the bandaged abdomen constrains every climb and final reading. Tower, cellar, and pavement cracks are sketched with meteor hush and chlorophyll syllables that mirror internal quiet. Coffee-ring map and frosted hourglass recur as tactile, handled objects that steer action. Environment never stalls momentum; detail is selective and filtered through Mara's wound-focused attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“move her story from rupture to meaning”—is signaled early and tested by each deliberate tug on stitches. Escalation is Accumulative: pain intensifies, tunnel lengthens, hourglass grains dwindle, tightening the cost of continuation. Final pour narrows options: wound stays open but readable, neighborhood exhales. Persistent constraint (leaking blood, light lost from body) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific images: scars as text, miracles as misplaced light, plants as guilt-ridden witnesses. No moralizing; the closing script on skin answers the thematic question wordlessly. Subtext resides in silence between ivy whispers and the healer’s absence. Ambiguity lingers—who dragged the miracle?—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perception is filtered through surgical haze and vegetal telepathy without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors state: long, breath-held clauses at dawn, staccato verbs while tunneling. Diction stays within Mara’s lexicon (“chlorophyll syllables,” “meteor hush”) and avoids register drift. No dialogue, so voice purity holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract under physical strain. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, no stacking. Information density high: “brown rings on the saucer are the only maps she trusts” does setting, character, and world-rule work. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing surgical recovery, plant telepathy, and urban miracle displacement yields a singular composite. Coffee-ring cartography and frosted hourglass as time-and-text instruments feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk—reopening wound while tunneling with bread knife—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names change; the concept is inseparable from this voice and scar.</comment>
