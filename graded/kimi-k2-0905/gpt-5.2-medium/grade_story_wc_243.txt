<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “gently thorough” nature is dramatized in every beat—her walnut-ink ritual, the deliberate rewriting of the oath, the public reading that forces the council’s hand—so the final renunciation of the sanitized record feels inevitable and costly. Interior contradiction is alive: archival duty collides with private guilt when the locket photo surfaces, and the embodied tremor in her hands as she inks the confession shows the price. The only bar to 9+ is that Jun himself remains off-stage; the emotional weight is filtered through Mara’s retrospective lens rather than tested in a live relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s insertion of the receipt-sized list of “everyday losses” reweights the entire covenant, making the town’s accountability hinge on tangible, ordinary grief. Causal chain holds—locket discovery → preface rewrite → public confrontation → new oath—with each because/therefore link tightening options. The moment she tears out the old “accident” page and lets the wind take it is the visible cost that locks the lens. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchors land within the first 100 words and the twilight jetty stays spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty is not backdrop but instrument: the tide sliding cold around ankles during the ceremony literalizes the town’s new, uncomfortable accountability. Walnut odor, salt-stained crate, and lantern glare are filtered through Mara’s archivist senses, guiding her choices—she steeps parchment in walnut broth because the color matches riverbed guilt. The locket’s barnacle-etched hinge and the blackberry-jam grin inside are specific enough to charge the final image when the object becomes a seed dropped into the sea. Micro-setting (the crate used as altar, the planks that pulse “not with threat but with a living record”) directly constrains the ritual choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the town will admit its complicity in Jun’s death and the seawall failure—is signaled on page 1 and escalates through each public beat: private discovery → archival revision → civic confrontation → collective oath. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara hands the locket photo to the mayor and priest; their rehearsed lines collapse under live evidence, foreclosing the option of sanitized renewal. Cost is visible: the council signs with shaking hands, the tide soaks shoes, Jun’s mother sacrifices the last physical relic. One micro-turn suffices at this length, and it delivers both moral and social price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: history is a mutable, living text whose ethical weight depends on which small losses are granted archival permanence. The walnut ink, receipt sheet, and jam-stained grin accumulate into a quiet argument that public memory must honor private absence. Subtext lives in gesture—touching the locket to lips before surrendering it—rather than exposition. The final image of wind carrying the torn “accident” page beyond lantern-light offers a non-literal, resonant answer: erasure itself becomes the price of admission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature: tannins, ledger columns, the hiss of reeds “like paper.” Syntax lengthens during reflective beats (“history was not a parade of heroes but a weight of small moments…”) then tightens under pressure (“She tore out the page… let the wind take it”). No head-hopping; the mayor and priest remain opaque except through their faltering speech, maintaining distance. The rhythmic control of the final paragraph—single sentence stretching across the pulse of planks—earns the lyric lift without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, selective, and physically coherent: “reeds hiss like paper” mirrors Mara’s archival vocation, and the metaphor never mutates. Information density is high—walnut broth steeping simultaneously reveals process, color symbolism, and moral stain. Opening and closing lines are precise anchors; no filler paragraphs survive the cut test. Even the experimental long sentence at the end earns its breath because the prior cadence has trained the ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “regenerated covenant” premise flips the familiar coastal-catastrophe trope into a story about bureaucratic micro-editing as moral courage. Walnut ink as both medium and metaphor, the locket-as-seed, and the receipt-sheet replacement are specific inventions that would collapse if swapped with generic equivalents. The notion that admitting appetite to the sea might earn mercy feels fresh yet inevitable within the story’s logic. Risk is taken—quiet archival act as climax—yet coherence never wavers, giving the piece a singular, memorable aftertaste.</comment>
