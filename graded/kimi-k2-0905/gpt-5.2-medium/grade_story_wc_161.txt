<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s distrust-turned-risk is embodied in the meteorite pendulum and bird-choice ritual; the final release carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“balance on a narrow beam between rafters” shows trust regained through body, not label. One beat only, so depth caps at 8.4, but contradiction and micro-choice are on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: receipt → hidden scores → shared meteorite → dawn release; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses retreat by sending birds, cost felt in “attic emptied.” No orientation debt; lens stable. Minor ellipsis (night reflection) is paid off in choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic dust, beam, skylight, and pigeon cages form a micro-setting that literally steers her bird-selection tactic; environment constrains action. Sensory triad—foxed paper, meteorite weight, song echo—filters through Mara's vigilance. Space stays coherent; no white-room. Final image of emptying loft is charged by prior detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trust again or lose last songs”—tightens when meteorite match forces her to test loyalty. One decisive turn: she copies and releases, forfeiting deniability. Cost is legible in Merek’s tremor and her own “bloom and wither.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forged vs. authentic preservation emerges through paper trails, meteorite twins, and released birds—no moral stated. Subtext in Oren’s dry boots and Merek’s tremor implies larger censorship stakes. Final empty attic reweights earlier hoarding; resonance is concrete. Avoids tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual bias—dust mote reading, meteorite shadow tracing. Syntax flexes from compressed clauses to lyrical cadence when songs surface, mirroring her risk. No head-hopping; distance stable. Distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—single sentences double as world-building and emotional tilt (“paper carried music longer than lungs”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold. Strong verbs (“withered her throat,” “emptied the attic”) keep momentum. Clean mechanics; paragraph cuts tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing courier-pigeon tradecraft with banned-music preservation feels fresh; meteorite twin as trust-test is non-obvious. Dust-mote divination method is specific and taught early. Risky compression succeeds under 800 words. Could swap names but dust-beam-bird logic would collapse, so originality holds.</comment>
