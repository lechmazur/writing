<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quietly stubborn stewardship and his need to reconcile an old lie with living plants are rendered through tactile ritual (marble-polishing, midnight cuttings). Interiority stays grounded in sensory work; the final admission to the hedges crystallizes a believable, earned shift. The only drag is a touch of self-explanatory phrasing (“he learned that some false fronts…”) that slightly blunts the contradiction in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the meter’s climb reframes “luck” as physiological alignment with honest labor, a cost paid in public shame and aching thumbs. Causal chain holds: past fraud → secret repair → present confession → measurable shift. The maze-night is one continuous scene; orientation is clear by line 5. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting rules: cracked marbles, jam-jar lanterns, and yew gate constrain every beat; the living hedge literally absorbs the confession. Sensory triangulation (scent of rot and rosemary, lantern-light on fractures) mirrors bloom/decay tension. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating bodies. Environment directly shapes the final meter reading, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a garden forgive its gardener?—tightens when the old fraud is quantifiably punished. The one-night maze ritual forces a public confession that forecloses further denial; pulse and breath become the battleground. Cost is visible: aching back, trembling hands, the marble left behind. Escalation is steady under the causal lens; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: measurable luck vs. immeasurable care. The marble ledger, bloom/withering imagery, and final meter spike reconfigure the concept of “value” without a thesis statement. Subtext resides in silence—Mera’s wordless watch, the hedge absorbing sound. Final image of “proof had to be tended” offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual tics—fractures “like spider silk,” saving string, naming cultivars. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as he polishes the last marble. No head-hopping; Mera’s interior is withheld, read through gesture. Register remains the gardener’s plain pragmatism even at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—“dying vine curling back on itself.” Sentence variety propels the night walk without drumbeat. One clause (“because in a measurable world the tiny wins…”) edges toward aphorism but is earned by prior concrete ledger. Clean copy, zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “luck economy” trope is inverted: fortune is redefined as biometric honesty to one’s labor. Marbles-as-private-accounting and the maze-as-confessional feel specific, not gimmick. The story’s risk—quiet ritual instead of dramatic reversal—pays off by making physiology the climax. Synthesis of quantified fate and humble horticulture is fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
