<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—grief as “bruise,” the goat’s kick sparking a possible laugh—yet the narrator’s contradictory impulses (clinging to pain while hiring a joy-teacher) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in one compressed beat; the final permission to let grief move is earned, but the micro-choice that proves the shift is the silent walk to the fence, not a visceral fork inside the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bouquet wedged beside the cedar bird, petals “riding upward into the blade wash” reweights the premise—lightness is not happiness but motion of grief—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irrevocable scattering of the last physical shard of Lena, paid on the page. Orientation is clean within 60 words; causality holds through the goat-kick spill that crystallizes the hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Turbine shadows as “slow clock hands,” the cedar shavings “pale ribbons,” and the goat’s warm milk splatter anchor every beat; the fence-post becomes the charged micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, passing the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays narrow to wind, wood, and bruised air—economy without white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—permission to feel grief without mandated joy—tightens when Orin’s confession of past complicity raises the price of trust; the goat’s kick supplies the single visible reversal that converts narration from farce to fragile laughter, narrowing options to endure rather than solve. Cost is legible in the bouquet’s relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: ritualized attention to mundane acts reframes grief as kinetic rather than curative. The final image scatters the bouquet into turbine wash, reweighting “lightness” as motion, not redemption—resonant ambiguity earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a bruised, hushed texture—syntax lengthens under fatigue, then snaps short at the kick-cued laugh. Orin’s theatrical diction contrasts yet never leaks into narrator’s idiom; perceptual signature stays consistent, teaching the reader to hear turbines as surf.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with chore pacing; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“summoning of water from the deep well”) is motivated by Orin’s mock-epic narration, not authorial purple, and drops away at the quiet ending, preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-mandate grief reclaimed through forced-joy whistleblower feels fresh; the inversion of morale artistry into private liturgy grows inevitably from shared history. Risk in marrying absurd epic narration to bereavement pays off when the goat kicks, collapsing artifice into lived mess.</comment>
