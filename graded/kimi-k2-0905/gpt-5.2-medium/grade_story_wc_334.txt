<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lissa’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. visceral need to taste the mushroom—drives every beat; the final act of ingestion is earned by the decades-long habit of counting that she now breaks, paying the cost of blankness reversed. Emotion is embodied (hands hover in dark water, tongue meets cool cap) without label-speak. The only minor slip: the “kinder” promise is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting the hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: stolen pages restored, lens held (Accumulative/Textural—pattern of habits, stars, rings). Causality is tight: forgetting to count → theft; tasting mushroom → return; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Cost is visible—“decades of blankness folded back”—and the final image of her repainting constellations shows the constraint persists. No orientation or plot amnesia issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned greenhouse, mushroom ring, and fractured star-map are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the ring is the latch, the shards are the map, the taste is the key. Every sensory detail is filtered through Lissa’s folklorist gaze—rust, apple, algae—guiding her hand to the exact spot. Spatial choreography is immaculate: descent, lantern tilt, upward swim track cleanly. Environment constrains the final choice and charges the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen self—signals early and tightens once: the spiral of broken stars points to the ring, forcing the choice to taste. Escalation is textural/density-driven: each artifact (notebook, constellations, mushroom) reweights the cost of the blank pages. Agency is clear—she plucks and tastes—foreclosing the safe scholar’s path. Price is felt on-page: the crisp nostalgia that restores memory also commits her to annual tending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is not archived but cultivated, stolen only when we refuse to taste our own myths. The missing stars, broken habits, and drowned orchard form one returning lattice whose final re-painting reframes the earlier theft as invitation. No moralizing—just the charged image of her hand repainting guardians instead of graves. Ambiguity lingers: the Court is still inside the ring, kindness still unmeasured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively folkloric—compressed, lyrical, salted with professional diction (“cataloged,” “field notes”) yet capable of sensuous plunge (“apple-sweet and iron-clean”). Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror dive descent; short clauses spike at the taste. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays in Lissa’s body. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt her own habits crack”) rather than dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances memory, setting, or mythic rule. Figurative layer is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “she remembered the fever, the boy on the pier, the promise…” lists three abstractions in a row; a concrete sensory fragment would sharpen. Otherwise, cadence breathes with scene tempo, and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring memory-theft under shipwreck-guarded greenhouse is a fresh synthesis; the inversion that the ring is latch, not warning, feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky second-person mythic tone is fully committed and paid off. Specificity of folklorist method and star-map spiral prevents swapability. The story could not transplant to another trope-set without collapse.</comment>
