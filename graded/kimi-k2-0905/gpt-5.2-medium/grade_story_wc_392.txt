<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific empiricist vs. inherited memory—drives every micro-choice; the lantern-touch flash fuses past and present, forcing the decisive leak. Her “watchfully calm” trait is embodied, not labeled, and the final refusal of Kellan’s order costs her safety while staying credibly within her forensic discipline. The only minor drag: the father’s death is summoned once and never re-embodied, so the emotional extra layer feels asserted, not lived.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: cut brake-line → staged scene → lantern triggers memory-map → evidence leak → stance shift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she climbs back down knowing reprisal is coming; the lingering lantern warmth is the felt price. Orientation is locked by line 3; no teleporting props or knowledge cheats. One micro nit: the courier-drone signal clarity is asserted, not shown, but it doesn’t break the beat.</comment>

<comment>The tunnel breathes through soot patterns, bolt spacing, and the impossible kerosene ghost-smell; every sensory pick is filtered through Mara’s investigator gaze and steers her next move. The lantern’s Quaker star and 1921 tag act as micro-setting that literally re-routes her path to the riverfront shaft. Only the riverfront grass is sketched in a single adjective (“green”), a hair under the 9+ gate that demands the environment constrain the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—stop Kellan’s cover-up—tightens when the lantern memory reveals the old escape route, turning forensic duty into personal risk. The cut brake-line discovery is the visible price that forecloses the “worker error” option; uploading the files costs her career safety. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each new artifact (clipboard, footprints, lantern) shrinks her available moves until only betrayal or silence remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as inheritance vs. complicity: the same tunnels once ferried slaves, now ferry silenced labor; Mara chooses to repurpose the conduit for truth. The lantern’s reprise—extinguished yet warm—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; the final sentence lets the image of “next death” reverberate. The father memory is the lone untapped echo that could have deepened the cost.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Mara’s perceptual signature: sounds return “softer, like testimony after cross-examination.” Syntax lengthens under stress then snaps short for the upload beat, mirroring her pulse. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a transit investigator’s lexicon. Only one tiny drift: “oil” simile for Kellan’s voice is familiar, but it’s brief and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—atmosphere, fact, motive—without metaphor pile-ups. Concrete nouns (“portable shear,” “chalk arrows”) replace modifiers. Zero paraphrase loops; each detail advances. The final paragraph’s rhythm slows to match the extinguished flame, then snaps shut on “would not reverberate,” giving cadence closure. Clean copy: no tense slips, pronoun drift, or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing Underground Railroad artifact with modern transit cover-up is a fresh synthesis; the lantern’s reappearance feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk is taken by letting supernatural memory entangle a hard-boiled procedural, yet the piece commits fully and lands the reconfiguration. No trope recycling or prompt-checklist aroma. The specificity of “Quaker star” and “1921 tag” anchors the concept in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
