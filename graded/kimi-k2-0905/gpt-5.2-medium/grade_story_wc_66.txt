<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s copying obsession and vow to “teach dust to tell stories” give her a sharp, idiosyncratic drive that escalates to public risk. Interiority stays concrete—ink glowing after midnight, dust “wanting to listen”—but the final leap from clandestine scribe to open-air insurgent feels one beat under-motivated; we don’t see the micro-choice that burns her retreat bridge. Still, her flawed perseverance carries the thematic weight with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square performance releases secretly luminous scores, Censors paralyzed by their own audible confession, stories seeded in mist—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each copying act increases narrative density until the cloak-and-broadcast tactic crystallizes in one public, irreversible act. Orientation is taught early; pattern of pirate lyrics → orchestra parts → glowing dust is coherent, no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Soot drifting “like snow,” the coal-breathing tin, and the archive loft’s reused paper create tactile scarcity that constrains Mara’s methods. The ember alcove returns at climax, its glow unlocking the black cloth—setting actively reconfigures stakes. Selective sensory layering (sound of static, smell of coal) keeps momentum; spatial choreography stays clean even with crowd entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle living stories back into public hearing—tightens through each copying session and the final square gamble. One meaningful deepening: Censors’ sparkle-detection forces the black-cloak countermeasure, narrowing options. Cost is visible—Mara risks capture, orchestra risks bread-line livelihood—and the irreversible public broadcast forecloses secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—art as subversive memory—emerges from ink glowing on scores and dust whispering confessions, never sermonized. Final image of mist holding “stories like seeds” reweights earlier famine without moralizing. Subtext in Vell’s “thistled calm” and Censors’ footsteps sounding “like confession” lets silence carry critique. Complexity remains: no guarantee seeds will grow, yet act was necessary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance to Mara; perceptual signature filters world through manuscript detail—silence “notated,” letters “shine.” Syntax grows clipped under risk (“She agreed, but only…”) then expands during the luminous release, mirroring emotional arc. No head-hopping; diction stays within copyist’s lexicon. Dialogue sparse but distinct—Vell’s calm vs. Ashmouth’s lyrical fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphors (dust, ember, thistle) form coherent field without overcrowding beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length, supporting musical cadence. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts register above Mara’s voice but occurs outside peak beats. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, strong verbs anchor the lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses post-apocalyptic silence with orchestral piracy in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; “story famine” and glowing notation synthesize into new mythic key. Risk—public broadcast under Censor gaze—pays off emotionally and conceptually. No familiar plot template; transformation test fails if names/places swapped because specificity of copying practice and dust-speech is integral. Bold yet controlled.</comment>
