<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pseudonymist’s curiosity, tactile chalk-mapping, and split-second invention of “M. Return” show clear micro-choices under rising pressure; the trembling courier supplies external stakes. Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional cost is more implied than embodied—no visceral contradiction or visible price is paid by the protagonist herself—so the arc lands just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chalk codes → scan margins → discover intercepted skins → invent trap-alias → mail letter. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s skin-mail system is now booby-trapped against the archive thief, and the protagonist’s chalk marks become active surveillance. Orientation is anchored by 60 words; no lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final postal act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Golden arcade, dawn light, postal membranes, and chalk scuffs are filtered through the narrator’s professional gaze; every sensory note doubles as tool or clue. The floor-as-envelope and warm maintenance hatch constrain the final tactic, charging the closure image. One stray detail—“polymer folder”—lacks tactile handling, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the courier’s anonymity from archive theft—tightens when ghost-notes reveal interception. The protagonist’s agency (chalk trap, alias creation) escalates under causal pressure; the tightening is single but meaningful. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, capping entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: privacy survives only by poisoning the very surfaces that promise it. Subtext lives in chalk child’s-play that becomes forensic weapon. Final image reweights earlier nostalgia into wary vigilance without moralizing. Complexity is honored—archive may deserve mistrust—creating lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a forensic-archivist’s precision—”calibration tables,” “postal membrane”—yet modulates into wistful memory of grandmother’s whistle. Rhythm tightens under pressure: long sensory clauses collapse into staccato invention “M. Return.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. One clause drifts toward ornate (“citywide skin, still whispering truths”) but stays within allowable lyric lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “golden bars threw warm bars” layers light, texture, and postal metaphor in one sweep. No scaffold loops; figurative control holds. One micro-redundancy—“surface mail” repeated twice in 30 words—drops the score a hair. Otherwise propulsion is clean, with purposeful paragraph breaks mirroring discovery beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of nostalgic arcade aesthetics with biometric mail-surveillance feels fresh and inevitable. Chalk hopscotch repurposed as cryptographic bait is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken—world rules taught on the fly—yet clarity holds. The concept could not swap settings without collapse, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
