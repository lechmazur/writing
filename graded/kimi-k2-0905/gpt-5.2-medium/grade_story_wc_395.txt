<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory motives—obedience to policy vs hunger for truth—drive every micro-choice; the final lie is earned by the breadcrumb trail of numbers and costs her the safety of corporate anonymity. Interiority is concrete (“listen for what the database refuses to say”), never label-speak. The mother reveal reframes prior obsession without tidy healing, keeping flaw intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (numbers → locked folder → Chute → buoy) tightens options because/therefore. Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice—Mara seeds the numbers publicly, trading secrecy for collective rescue; cost is legible in the coat-patch image. One transition (midnight descent) is clean; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Server hum, lattice embroidery, and song-echo function as micro-settings that constrain access and cue memory; the patch threads “like roads” charge the final image stitched to her coat. Selective sensory detail (cold status lights, clipped choruses) filters through Mara’s archival ear, never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the vanished—tightens when the Chute proves deletion is exile; the 11-27-73 breadcrumb narrows Mara’s options to public betrayal. Escalation is causal: each decoded number forecloses silence and raises exposure cost. Final lie crystallizes stance with visible professional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of engineered silence vs communal memory emerges from the Chute reveal and coat-patch gesture; no moralizing statement, only the reweighted meaning of “deleted.” Subtext in the sung coordinates implies alive-ness without declaring it. Final image seeds hope yet accepts corporate retaliation as inevitable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person archival voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—metadata slips, checksum fragments, song track numbers—without ever slipping POV. Compression (“I lie one last time”) is taught early and pays off. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in archive daylight, clipped diction inside the Chute.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene, voice, and world work (“families still tag the dead…three in the morning”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors (threads like roads) stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits corporate narrator lexicon and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Corporate memory-keeper angle gives fresh spin to missing-person trope; using pop-song checksums as encrypted coordinates feels novel yet inevitable. The Chute-as-exile而非deletion reframes digital afterlife with social cost. Risk—lyric collage of sung messages—lands cleanly under causal lens.</comment>
