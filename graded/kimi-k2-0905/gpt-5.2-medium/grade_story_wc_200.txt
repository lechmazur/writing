<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—laughter as medicine against her own grief—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she lays the crocodile tooth in Elowen’s palm crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“Mara felt the old guilt in her own wrists”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent. The arc earns its renunciation: Mara reclaims her own grief only after Elowen’s laugh dissolves the phantom bundle. One hairline slip: “modestly fearless” is told, not shown in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gorge returns Elowen’s laugh “gentler,” reconfiguring both women’s options without tidy resolution; cost is the lingering mist that once was a child. Causal linkage holds throughout—each pluck of the warped harp because/therefore exposes more confession until the laugh breaks pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Echo Gorge”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the crocodile tooth is introduced, carried, and transferred under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gorge’s acoustic feedback loop is not backdrop but tactical constraint: the misaligned harp can only speak through distortion, forcing Mara to listen rather than command. Micro-setting—the tooth, the lantern unlit, the invisible bundle—functions as environment that charges the final image when the bundle dissolves. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: sunrise is “a sliver” withheld until guilt loosens. One minor overdraft: “river was a ribbon of pewter” edges toward postcard, but the next sentence re-anchors POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free Elowen by finding the laugh hidden inside her shame—tightens once: the confession of wanting to flee tightens the noose, then the frog rhyme ruptures it. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; each bent note because/therefore drags more forbidden memory into light. Price is legible: the invisible bundle evaporates, costing Elowen the last relic of the child and Mara the comfort of her own unprocessed grief. No coincidence resolves; the gorge only echoes what is offered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—laughter as the razor edge between self-forgiveness and self-erasure—emerges through the frog-crown joke reprised in warped harmonics, never abstractly named. Subtext lives in gesture: the crocodile tooth, once ripped from a godling’s laugh, now passed like a confession baton. Final image of “thin sunrise” reframes earlier darkness without moralizing. Thematic echo risk is flirted with when Mara says “grief could calcify,” but line is saved by immediate embodiment in wrists and harp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature: she notices echoes, damp, string tension, never lore dumps. Syntax lengthens under pity (“the confession spilled faster”) then fractures at the laugh (“it wobbled and brightened”), mirroring emotional crescendo. No head-hopping; Elowen’s interior arrives only as audible confession filtered through gorge distortion. Distinct diction—“water glass” for specter, “pewter” for river—remains within Mara’s poetic but grounded lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative control keeps vehicles consistent—sound as liquid (“poured down,” “brush her face like cold rain”)—without mixed-metaphor clutter. High information density: “lantern unlit” signals night, humility, and tool in three syllables. Rhythm modulates from long breathless confession lines to the staccato laugh crack, propelling closure without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—soul collector who fishes ghosts with laughter through a broken harp—feels myth-fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if midwife joke swapped: the frog rhyme’s banality is the very key that dissolves Elowen’s shame. Risk taken: entire plot hinges on acoustic metaphysics, but pattern is taught early and paid off. No trope checklist; crocodile tooth, gorge echo, and laugh-cure braid into one irreplaceable spell.</comment>
