<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The caretaker’s refusal to abandon travelers despite the tightening curse is embodied in every near-touch and counted minute; the interior contradiction between self-preservation and moral duty is kept alive in scene, not summary. The final decision to complete the waystones costs something palpable—another splinter of autonomy—and reads as earned. Minor slip: the child-rescue beat is slightly expedient, muting the full cost at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: blueprint memory → nut → waystone → birds confused → safe exit, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Decisive Change: the labyrinth now carries singable escape routes, the orchard’s curse faces outward forever. Cost is legible in the final line—“the path… will not”—a quiet but irreversible reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frost-threaded slate corridors, brass-wing clicks, and breath-bruised bark are filtered through the caretaker’s tactile deprivation, turning absence into sensory data. The nut-as-key and echoing waystone song tether micro-setting to choice. One notch off 9+ only because the Duke’s backstory is still slightly abstract, not yet corporeally felt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the child before frost mirrors the maze—tightens via the 47-minute countdown and each clattering bird pass. The caretaker’s agency is indirect yet pivotal: shadow-pressure assemblies, not muscle, shift the patrol pattern. Escalation peaks when the first frost threads the corners even as the song leads out; the price is the curse’s deeper bite, implied but undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of imperfect stewardship: a cursed, non-touching guardian reshapes a tyrant’s labyrinth into communal mercy. The orchard’s safe-path purpose is repriced from grave-marker to living map without moralizing. Subtext lives in the birds’ “reluctant applause”—beauty drafted into surveillance, then momentarily reeducated. Final image reframes the Duke’s legacy as caretaker-governed infrastructure, a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a frost-bitten precision—offhand exactitude as both gift and scar. Syntax tightens under countdown pressure, then exhales at the gate. Mechanical birds get “graceless beauty,” a phrase that modulates tone without authorial intrusion. No head-hop, no register drift; perceptual signature remains consistent even in lyric lifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark” does triple sensory, metaphorical, and causal duty. Rhythm varies from clipped counts to longer breath-stained clauses, mirroring maze turns. One mixed metaphor—“reluctant applause”—is earned by context and does not obscure clarity. No loops, no filler, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchard curse, mechanical birds, and sonic waystones feels fresh yet inevitable; the Duke’s unfinished blueprint repurposed as ethical cartography is a smart inversion of tyrant infrastructure. Specificity—nut clicks like a jaw, birds spiral in confusion—grounds the fantastical. Risk is taken in non-touch problem-solving and pays off. Not quite 9+ only because the child-rescue trope is familiar at its core.</comment>
