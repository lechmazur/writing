<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nira’s contradictory impulses—scientific control versus surrender to inherited dreams—are dramatized in tactile micro-choices (copper helix turns, thumb on crack). The final renunciation of severance for curation is earned; cost is felt in the quaking knees and the decision to descend. Interiority stays concrete, though “synaptic plasticity” flirts with label-speak once. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s modified lattice lets Nira keep every dream yet assigns each a “clean angle of return,” reweighting her prior goal of erasure. Causal chain holds—because she rewires the node, therefore she inherits custodianship instead of amnesia. Orientation is swift: moonlit canyon, rim, wire, within 50 words. One minor scaffold: “She breathed in counts of five…” restates the prior sentence’s vibration tuning, but it does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cracked periscope mirror functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical move; its fracture pattern dictates where copper filament can be soldered. Moonlight pooled on ledges is sensory, selective, and filtered through Nira’s engineer gaze—she measures distance “against the stars.” Spatial choreography is clean: rim → flat stone → descent. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—rock turns translucent only after the mirror is tuned, a causal payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she excise or archive the foreign memories—tightens when the hospital corridor memory reveals her mother’s complicity. One meaningful deepening: the moment she shifts from sever to sort, foreclosing the option of pure self-erasure. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each solder point adds density rather than new causal reversals. Cost is visible—she accepts lifelong custodianship and quaking fear—though the price could be sharper if a personal memory were momentarily lost on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance as curatorial burden—emerges through the mirror’s reconfiguration rather than statement. The final image of translucent strata offers a non-literal answer: identity is stratified custody, not private property. Subtext operates in gesture: handing the periscope to the miner is both surrender and rescue. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the quaking descent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Nira’s perceptual signature—helix metaphors, star triangulation, engineer’s pulse count. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, staccato solder turns for action. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. One filter-verb cluster (“she saw the moon fractured…”) is voice-motivated through the periscope lens. Patterned elision—“strangers were memories”—is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and technical work (“copper helix…solder point…collision”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes”—reads as POV hallucination, not incoherence. One paraphrase loop: “she rehearsed…until it settled…she rehearsed…until it stopped” costs −0.2, but it does not appear in the final third, so 9+ global cap is waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The dream-mine periscope as external hard-drive for communal sleep is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and neurology. Entangled memories treated as archaeological strata transforms a familiar sci-fi trope into curatorial ethics. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. The concept is inseparable from this canyon, this mirror, this voice—swap any element and the story collapses.</comment>
