<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysa’s fear-of-commitment flaw is embodied in her gravity-defying drift; the tablet confrontation forces her to stay in one timeline, paying the cost of heavier emotional weight. Interiority is concrete (“floated away from love to avoid being pulled down”), not label-speak. The final micro-choice—pressing the tablet to her chest and choosing gravity—earns the change; causality holds. One slip: the younger-self apparition is more mirror than crucible, so the relationship-as-pressure bullet is only weakly met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the runes steady, timelines fold, and she walks away heavier—cost is legible. Causal lens holds: because she confronts the fear-generated branches, therefore she can choose one weighted timeline. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“glowing viaduct after rain”). No plot amnesia; tablet rules are taught through iterative testing. Minor time-stutter: the patrol-drone strand is introduced and dropped without tactical consequence, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wet glass tiles and suspended water bead function as micro-setting that constrains her temporal loops—she can only re-enter while the bead hangs. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: a gravity-defier notices “which direction was down.” Light and river traffic evolve with the timeline splits, mirroring internal fracture. The tablet’s warmth and runic rearrangement are tactile, not expository. Meets 9-gate: the viaduct’s charged surface is the final image she walks across, reweighted by her new heaviness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the self-made labyrinth—signals early. Escalation under causal lens: each fear-widened branch narrows her exit until the final breath-held moment forces the stay-or-drift choice. Cost is visible: she rises “heavier than before,” foreclosing the old weightless avoidance. One tightening beat suffices; no external antagonist needed. Drone strand adds texture but no extra pressure, capping at 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the procedural maze: avoidance multiplies corridors; commitment collapses them. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the tablet to her chest replaces verbal epiphany. Final image reweights “darkening brightness” as the viaduct flares then dims, echoing her internal shift. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will she stay grounded later?). Lacks the final conceptual punch to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual signature: physics-of-gravity metaphors, sensor-repair idiom, and temporal loop compression. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during breath-held beats, then widens at closure. No head-hopping; younger-self apparitions are externalized memory, not POV breaches. Distinctive syntax (“periodically eternal”) is taught early and paid off. Clean 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the script were reading her back” does double duty—image + stakes. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances choice or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth = procedural branches). One mixed vehicle: “wet tracks of light” beside “pages closing” is allowable under lyric compression. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gravity-defying tech and mythic clay tablet feels inevitable, not grafted. Procedural-generation rule-set is borrowed from her sensor-testing day-job, grounding the fantasy. Risk: recursive timeline story in under 800 words—pulled off via breath-held bead device. Specificity of “glowing viaduct after rain” keeps it from generic multiverse fare. Fresh inflection: using fear as the branching algorithm.</comment>
