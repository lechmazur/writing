<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—her “expectant resignation”—is dramatized in the first paragraph through the tactile cue of the cracked rosette, anchoring motive. The micro-choice to “subtract noise” by writing each singer’s sacrifice on the chalkboard externalizes her braid-until-it-tears ethic and visibly raises the cost of failure. The final quiet that “sits… like a verdict” crystallizes her stance without epiphany overload. One hairline slip: the father-church flashback is told, not braided into present pressure, so the unlearning feels asserted rather than embodied in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the councilman’s downward glance and verbal concession carry undeniable social cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens—the choir’s subtracted-noise chord reweights “progress.” Causality holds: each rehearsal deletion (sarcasm, silence, shout) accumulates into the final sustained note that forces the reversal. Orientation is clean within 120 words; velvet library, autumn cold, and budget memo anchor who-where-when. No plot amnesia; the repaired zither’s shadow on the score sheet is the taught pattern that pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The velvet library’s hush, “like a station after the last train,” functions as micro-setting that constrains the choir’s need for stillness; the cold windows and warm rugs physically mirror the town’s fading arts budget. The zither rosette evolves from cracked absence to shadow-casting aperture, charging the final chord with literal air passage. Spatial choreography stays coherent across rehearsal scrapes and council front-row. One minor slip: “traveled stillness” is evocative but not sensory-specified, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—arts wing closure—tightens through subtractive rehearsals; each surrendered noise is a visible price that narrows options toward the final chord. The council’s front-row stiffness supplies coherent external pressure; the choir’s internal risk is the potential silence if the chord fails. No coincidence resolves; the sustained note earns the reversal. Cost is legible in the miner’s lost sarcasm, Niko’s dropped shout, and Mara’s wagered credibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid metaphor: harmony is not additive but subtractive, a counter-intuitive ethic that reweights “progress” as absence. The repaired rosette’s “lace of shadow” reprises the carved vines, reframing beauty as permeability, not preservation. No moralizing; the councilman’s quiet look is the resonant, non-literal answer. The immigrant kids’ shift from stones to budgets keeps moral complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “expectantly resigned,” thumb on rosette, listening to hush “as if it were a pilgrim returning.” Syntax lengthens under emotion (“braid diverse voices into harmony until the braid could not be pulled apart without tearing everyone”), then shortens during subtractive rehearsals, mirroring control. No head-hopping; councilman’s interior is only external glance. Distinctive diction—“travelled stillness,” “memos that arrived like dust”—without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high information density—“the vanishing arts were quieter casualties, erased not by flames but by memos”—carries two jobs (image + stakes) without padding. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (velvet hush, station echo, lace shadow) is deployed once and repurposed at closure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One near-miss: “expectantly resigned” risks oxymoron cliché, but the contradiction is immediately embodied in action, so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The subtractive choir exercise flips the familiar “find your voice” trope into “find the song by subtracting noise,” a fresh operational ethic. The cracked rosette reframed as necessary air passage transforms a decorative artifact into a conceptual hinge. Risk is taken: lyric accumulation over plot pyrotechnics, but coherence holds. While the save-the-arts plot is familiar, the inverse pedagogy and permeability metaphor synthesize into a memorable inflection.</comment>
