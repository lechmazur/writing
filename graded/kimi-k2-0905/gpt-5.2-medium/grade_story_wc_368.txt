<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“new heart thudding politely,” “borrowed pulse quicken”); the dyer’s habit of control versus Sairi’s open-handed practice creates a clean contradiction. The final vow lands as credible renunciation because the trail of sun-lit testimonies has already re-weighted his hierarchy of values. Minor slip: “quietly explosive” is used as label twice before it is dramatized in the dye sparks, muting the earliest beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance flips from hoarding stories to releasing them, cost felt in the illuminated mist-images that vanish. Causal chain—wing → map → sun-mirror → dye → vow—holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Orientation is secure by line 5; the floating rock’s physics is left tacit but never asked to solve the plot, so no waiver breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Valley mist, rope stair, prism wires, and jar of “Caution” dye are tactile and filtered through the dyer’s professional eye. The tea house’s slow rotation keeps spatial choreography legible and supplies the final underside crack where the dye waits. Micro-setting triumph: the morpho wing’s cold flash against the jar mouth charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he cling to control or release stories?”—tightens when each sun-dot forces him to witness Sairi’s generosity. The penultimate beat (dye sparks illuminating vanished people) forecloses retreat; the vow is the only remaining option. Cost is visible: the images fade, leaving him committed to an unmeasured path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relation between fixing color and freeing stories; the final image of vanishing silhouettes re-weights “iridescent caution” as stewardship, not possession. No moralizing statement—just the vow under lantern-light—lets ambiguity linger. The butterfly wing’s shift from warning to catalyst supplies a quiet ironic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: color-metaphors, dye-craft precision, and cautious sensorium. Syntax tightens under pressure—“dye leapt up in sparks, quietly explosive in my palms”—mirroring cardiac spike. No head-hopping; diction stays within the dyer’s artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering recedes when stakes peak, preventing purple overload. One paraphrase loop (“stories magnetize… stories stick”) and a filter-verb cluster (“I began to understand”) mildly dull momentum. Otherwise rhythm breathes, and every paragraph advances knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating tea house + sun-trail cartography + donor-heart story-magnetism synthesizes into a fresh mythic logic that feels inevitable in hindsight. The conceit that sunlight is a repeating handwriting turns a familiar quest into luminous cartography. Risk is high yet clarity survives; no derivative template detected.</comment>
