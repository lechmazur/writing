<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” trait are dramatized through the plant-code negotiation and the portrait that cracks Joren’s reserve; the final shared star-light awakening shows earned change with mutual cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment she “knows she has found a lever” edges toward label-speak, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each plant arrangement and traded awakening thickens pattern until the spiral courtyard reconfigures Joren’s greed into attentive stillness; the closing note vibrates glass and meaning with visible cost to both. Causality is lyric rather than plot-heavy, but the final image reweights all prior trades and lands as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass shards, soot, velvet pouch, and rosemary sprigs are tactile anchors that constrain bargaining tactics; the spiral of weeds and cracked eggshells literally maps breath onto stone, charging the closure. Selective sensory detail mirrors Mara’s texture-first sight and keeps the courtyard alive without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—secure the reed tongue without hollowing oneself—tightens when Joren rejects money and demands awakenings; Mara’s escalating plant offers and final shared-star trade foreclose the option of continued consumption. Pressure grows through each coded pot shift; cost is legible when Joren feels the spiral awaken “something not for sale.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of valuing imperfection over extraction emerges through glass fractures, color-blind sight, and the choice to share rather than steal clarity; no moral is stated. The closing note reweights all prior barter as potentially mutual, resonating without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lush yet controlled third-person hovers close to Mara’s texture-obsessed perception; syntax lengthens during plant-code calms, then compresses at the reed-handoff. No head-hopping; Joren’s voice surfaces only once, gravelly from smoke, maintaining focal discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propel without scaffold, and carry double duty (e.g., “cold edge bites her palm like an honest mistake”). One mixed metaphor—“bartered awakenings… turned sour in his mouth”—is minor; no loops or register drift touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind painter + plant-code haggling + awakening-as-currency, all braided through glass craft. Risky lyric structure pays off when the spiral map makes the courtyard itself the traded awakening, transforming familiar barter trope into shared starlight.</comment>
