<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s empirical intuition is shown, not told, in her trust of depth marks and ant-trail experiment; the final refusal to inherit Ellis’s debts crystallizes her autonomy. Interior contradiction is light—anger at silence v. recognition of shared fear—but sufficient for 800 words. Cost is legible: she forfeits the secret press and an easy inheritance to keep her “clean decision.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: chip coordinates → ridge → sinkhole → cavern → binary exit. Closure is a Decisive Change—she chooses the wet passage, erasing the trail back; cost is the forfeiture of Ellis’s offer and any future claim to the press. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory detail—cedar/dust shop, wet-iron smell, milkweed rimming the sinkhole—filters through Mara’s map-dealer eye. The blooming cavern’s white fungi and trembling pools mirror her internal waver while constraining the final choice as water rises. Micro-setting (matrix chip’s silver crescent) literally guides the next move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own her “doorway of decisions” or accept Ellis’s pre-set form—tightens once: water rising v. dry inheritance. Escalation is causal and legible; the creek’s climb forces the either/or at the exact moment the chip slots home. Price is the lost press and any absolution of paternal debt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—choice as self-typesetting—emerges through typographic imagery (matrix, compositor’s grid, SET v. DISTRIBUTE) without explicit sermon. Final image of stepping into rain reweights the promise: the doorway is the act, not the place. Ambiguity lingers—she gains freedom but keeps her father’s debts—yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature is cartographic and empirical. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under rising water, mirroring pulse. Ellis’s diction (“every choice is typeset”) is distinct without stealing focal air. No head-hop or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“white fungi rose like lilies” serves as both image and warning of ephemerality. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. One typo: “compositor’s grid” should lose the apostrophe, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ant-trail navigation and typographic metaphors give fresh angle to the familiar “cave of choices.” Matrix chip as coordinate key rather than font tool is a non-obvious re-purposing. Emotional specificity—lonely map-seller who’s never chosen her own destination—grounds the concept. Risk in quiet refusal rather than grand escape pays off.</comment>
