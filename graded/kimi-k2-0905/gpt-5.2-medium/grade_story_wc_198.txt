<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is lyrically specific—vested hush as inherited silence—but the final renunciation (“exhaled it out as pure blankness”) is asserted rather than dramatized with bodily cost; we feel the loss conceptually, not viscerally. Contradictory impulses (preserve mother’s voice vs erase prophecy) are named, not simultaneously enacted in a single beat. Still, the occupation-silence link gives him memorable individuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town wakes ordinary, Lio remains alone under fading colors—options reweighted, silence now both home and wound. Accumulative lens holds: each whispered breath thickens the hush until the code stalls. Causality is internal and lyrical, not event-driven, but the final image pays the cost of maternal erasure, satisfying the required RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism atrium, leaded vest, drip-song code—every object is tactile, filtered through saxophonist’s ear-body. The grotto’s glass and water constrain movement and acoustics, shaping the tactic of “whisper through negative space.” Final fade of colors anchors the emotional cost in environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy before it colonizes townspeople—tightens via micro-choices: each withheld note increases psychic load. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates as dewdrops accelerate, forcing the final blank exhalation. Cost is conceptual; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as seal against horror emerges through image, not thesis: postcards of light, perfume in empty room. Final silence reweights mother’s lesson—art can protect by erasing itself. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the fading prism bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at lyric distance; syntax stretches and contracts like breath—controlled without monotony. Sensory diction stays inside musician’s perceptual lexicon. No dialogue, so voice remains pure, sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful; mixed metaphors (“postcards drifted across water”) are brief and licensed by dream-logic. Rhythm modulates with escalating dewdrops, propelling toward final hush. One paraphrase loop—“silence that felt like home and loss at once”—could compress, but it does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Code-bearing dewdrops and silence-as-armor feel fresh, not gimmick; inherited leaded vest literalizes acoustic metaphor. Risk lies in renouncing music to save the town—an inversion of artist-hero trope that pays off. Could edge higher with sharper sensory novelty in grotto biome.</comment>
