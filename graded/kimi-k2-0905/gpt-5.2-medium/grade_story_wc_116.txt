<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s vow of non-interference is stated, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse is tested in-scene, so the renunciation at the obsidian refuge feels pre-decided. The only micro-choice—tracing the swan—repeats without escalating cost. Interiority is atmospheric but generic; “grief into usable soil” is summary, not embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swan refolded, doorway closed, cost legible in the refusal to record. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the swan’s folds mirror passages, but the library→river transfer is asserted, not shown to constrain later options. Orientation is waived: disorientation is taught early and repaid in the final image of sunlight on spores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overgrown library, obsidian wall, and paper loam are tactile, odor-rich, and filter through the keeper’s archivist bias. The obsidian wall’s sound-drinking property directly shapes the final silence that reconfigures memory; micro-setting (swan creases) doubles as map, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the swan leads to a place that demands judgment, but the keeper’s refusal costs nothing we haven’t already been told he won’t pay. No new option is foreclosed; silence repairs him without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through composting imagery and the chamber that drinks sound. Final image—sunlight blooming mold on atlases—reweights decay as continuation without moralizing. Subtext is present; absence of recorded words becomes the text, though the insight is lightly earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is consistent, textured, and cadence-controlled: “paper softened into loam,” “river tasted of black glass.” Perceptual signature—cataloguing decay, measuring time by rot—remains distinct under pressure. No head-hopping; compression is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. “Spores bloom on parchment” does triple duty: image, theme, closure—high density without purple. Minor tic: repeated “drift of untold seasons” phrasing, not quite loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Origami swan as portal and memory-map feels fresh; volcanic silence-library hybrid is specific rather than trope-stacked. Risk lies in lyric stasis, but the piece commits fully. Could swap keeper with any monk-observer; individuality resides in voice, not choice, capping originality below 8.0.</comment>
