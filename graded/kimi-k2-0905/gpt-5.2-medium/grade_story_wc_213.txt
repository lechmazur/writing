<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maris’s interior contradiction—wanting alarms that warn without deafening—drives every micro-choice; the final switch costs her career risk and is earned by the glue-dry wait. “Credibly curious” stays embodied in sensor tweaks, not label-speak. The only slip: the dispatcher conflict is off-stage, so the relational crucible never fully pressurizes her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: cracked belfry → glue cure window → microclimate data → vane switch → low-note warning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the monastery’s single gratitude bell confirms the new protocol survives, cost visible in the dispatcher’s unanswered demand. Orientation anchor (“winter solstice…above the clouds”) lands by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Wind-scoured stone, ice needles, and lantern clock are filtered through Maris’s metrological gaze; every sensor placement roots us in altitude and cold. The bell rope’s dark river image reappears at the exact beat the glue dries, charging the final choice. Environment literally shapes the tactic: rope can’t be pulled, forcing the vane.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect valley without numbing them—tightens when zero-hour data forces a live choice: deafening siren vs. calibrated vane. The glue-cure clock externalizes the pressure; missing it risks both structural failure and bureaucratic censure. One meaningful escalation: microclimate needles bend, she flips switch, foreclosing the old protocol forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via sonic metaphor: listening as civic courage. The vane’s low note reweights every prior siren wail; no character moralizes. Final image—monks ring bell once in gratitude—lets the reader hear the silence that now carries warning. Subtle, non-didactic, resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Maris’s instrument-tuned perception; verbs like “translated air pressure into ink lines” carry her idiom. No head-hopping; dispatcher voice stays external via radio crackle. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for climb, staccato for data spikes, then a hush clause mirroring the vane note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—only “dark river” for rope—so clarity stays meteorological. One mixed metaphor risk: “clouds were holding their breath” is forgiven because it’s focalized through monk belief, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: weather tech meets monastic ritual, yielding a new warning ethics. The glue-dry constraint repurposes a mundane repair into a moral clock. Risk taken—quiet vane over blaring siren—pays off in closure without gimmickry. Could shave half-point only because “microclimate variation” jargon feels office-familiar, yet here it’s re-humanized.</comment>
