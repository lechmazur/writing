<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ilen’s obsession to “translate texture into sound” is embodied in every micro-choice (timing whispers to bird-flock turns, scraping bone floor with his own veins). The final renunciation—setting the diamond, accepting a voice “neither Toma’s nor Ilen’s alone”—carries visible cost and is earned by the prior pattern of feeding the gem without letting it swallow meaning. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the elders’ off-stage decline keeps this from perfect compression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tunnel’s new composite voice reconfigures what survival of a language can mean, cost paid by Ilen’s blood-on-bone scrape and the diamond’s stillness. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each texture recorded layers harmonic density until the final spiral of swifts crystallizes the stakes. Pattern taught early (echo as archive) and never breaks causality. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, slit tunnel, and copper-veined skin are not backdrop; they supply the only tools Ilen can use (echo chamber, tuning surface, resonating flesh). The flawed diamond’s chip and cloudiness are re-used as vibration receptors, then as curse-hunger, then as sated archive—object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Ilen’s tactile priorities: grain, pressure, rasp. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep Vey from silence—tightens when consonants soften season by season and the diamond threatens to swallow instead of store. One meaningful deepening: when swifts fail the night Toma dies, unpatterned echoes risk flattening every word; Ilen’s spiral-aligned breathing re-imposes cadence, foreclosing the option of endless sameness. Cost is legible: his own veins vibrate, diamond goes still, canyon keeps a voice no living mouth now owns. No reversal, but sufficient escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transmission survives through imperfection—the chip that catches vibration, the rasp that stores syllables, the flawed human throat. Final image of travelers “hearing” texture through rock reweights the premise that language needs native speakers. No moral is stated; the conceptual repricing is that archive can be a canyon, not a book. Subtext in Ilen’s quietness mirrors the tongue’s vanishing consonants.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Ilen’s perceptual filter: every noticed detail is acoustic or tactile, diction metallic and granular (“copper-veined,” “dry rasp,” “eager mouth”). Rhythm accelerates into breath-matched spiral, then cuts to stillness, mirroring echo decay. No head-hop; elders’ thoughts remain opaque, shown only through gesture. Compression and elision (“seasons their consonants softened”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do double duty: “He placed the diamond on Toma’s palm, asking him to stroke its chipped edge” advances action, reveals tenderness, and primes the vibration mechanic. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the acoustic world (flock as score, bone as organ pipe). Register stays within Ilen’s mineral lexicon; no corporate drift. Final scrape and spiral are rendered with surgical clarity—zero figurative muddle at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistic preservation as spelunking acoustics, cursed gem as phonograph needle, bird choreography as metronome. Risk of gimmickry is fully earned because every fantastical element is tethered to tactile consequence (copper veins bleed resonance, diamond hunger must be fed or controlled). No familiar trope is left untransformed; even “cursed gem” becomes archive rather than weapon. Conceptual integrity holds—story never flinches from its own logic.</comment>
