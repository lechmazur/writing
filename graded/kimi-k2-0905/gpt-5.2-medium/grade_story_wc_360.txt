<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel’s interior contradiction—borrowing selves until her own blurs—remains vivid and embodied; the final self-emptying beat is earned by the prior accumulation of borrowed voices. Micro-choices (fitting the halo fragment, pulling the blank broadside) visibly cost coherence, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Slight under-show of the “ledger” moment keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank broadside reweights empathy from gift to transformation, with the townspeople’s aligned sorrow as undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds—each printed sheet adds density until the final pattern break. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Orientation is taught early by star-thinning, waiving any penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and star-thinning sky constrain every tactical choice (ink, press, metal) and charge the final blank sheet with honey-gold afterglow. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kestrel’s printer’s eye—lead type, vellum breath, metal hum—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean across chase, press bed, and posted door. Meets 9+ gate: the fragment’s evolving sheen directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Kestrel recover her own self from the borrowed chorus—tightens when each swap costs coherence, culminating in the blank broadside that forecloses further transfers. Escalation is accumulative: density of borrowed selves rises until the final rotation empties her. Cost is legible in the “ledger of ratios” and the cooling press. One hairline slip: auditors’ anger drain is off-stage, slightly muting visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy as alchemical equation, not charity. The blank broadside’s conceptual repricing reweights earlier “transposed empathy” from clever trick to irreversible transformation. No moralizing; the ledger of ratios is image, not thesis. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own alignment with the townspeople’s sorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is printer-poetic: “misregistered prints,” “topaz dust,” syntax of metal and ink. Perceptual signature stays consistent—Kestrel notices kerning, starlight thinning, halo hum. Rhythm modulates from crowded clauses (borrowed selves arguing) to the final sparse ledger line. No head-hopping; courier and stranger remain externally focalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “wear it in her mouth” shows theft and sensuality. No loops, no scaffold, no filter stacks. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“stars being typeset and erased”) and paid off in the blank broadside. One near-drone in the auditors paragraph kept from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Letterpress-as-empathy-engine is fresh, grounded in tactile detail (chase, sort, forme). The equation E(x,y)=S(x)−S(y) reframes emotion as movable type, a synthesis not seen before. Risk—abstract math in lyric mode—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Transformation test fails if names change: the craft-specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
