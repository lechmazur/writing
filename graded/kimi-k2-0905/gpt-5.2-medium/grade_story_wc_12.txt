<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s micro-choices—matching breath to anaphora, drawing the circle—embody contradictory impulses (surrender vs. self-assertion) and pay the cost of a shivering body; Selo’s priestly restraint is equally specific. Interiority stays concrete: “quiet had been picked apart thread by thread.” The final renunciation is earned because the memory of mapping-as-search (not conquest) is dramatized, not told. Only the absence of Selo’s own flaw keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the single blue circle reweights “anchor” from prison to neighborly boundary, cost paid by the cold breeze that slips out of Mara. Causal linkage holds: each rhetorical device (anaphora, chiasmus, irony) tightens the knot until the memory loosen it. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“At the Dimensional Anchor”). Lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore step. No plot amnesia or soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basalt ring, ash-blue well, and body-as-micro-setting constrain every tactic: only one color can be used, only one circle drawn. Sensory selection is urgent—“air felt like a cloth over a bell”—and filtered through Selo’s priestly perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, palm, stone, circle. The final image is charged by the palette’s single color repurposed as boundary, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent full possession—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: each rhetorical loop narrows the parasite’s options until the memory surfaces and forecloses conquest. Visible price: Mara shivers, the ring trembles, the rift exhales cold. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves. Could edge 9.0 if the cost left a persistent physical mark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—maps as relationship, not conquest—emerges through the brother memory and the neighborly circle; no moralizing sentence states it. Subtext lives in gesture: the blue coin transferred from priest to apprentice equals trust, not weapon. The final image reweights “blank space” from threat to host. Ambiguity lingers: the rift remains open, dawn uncertain. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited locks to Selo with priestly diction—“loop pedal priest,” “rhetorical devices”—and perceptual signature that hears silence as lanterns. Compression is taught early (“decorates with silence”) and paid off in the deliberate pause that ends the piece. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior surfaces only through externalized flickers and speech. Rhythm modulates: looping cadence under pressure, then low precise litany, final fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—cloth-over-bell, thread-by-thread—taught early and coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stake or texture. One mixed metaphor—“unraveled stillness” is abstract, but immediately grounded by rewoven-by-stranger image. No artifacts in closure beat; final pause is earned, not overwritten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Loop-pedal exorcism via rhetorical devices is a fresh synthesis; the one-color palette as promise-limit converts standard magic-item trope into theological constraint. The possession is defeated not by fire but by epistemic reframing—an angle rarely seen. Specificity anchors novelty: brother-as-shelter memory, neighbor-with-undisclosed-names. Risk (quiet lyric fade) heightens rather than softens stakes. Transformation is total: swap any detail and the logic collapses.</comment>
