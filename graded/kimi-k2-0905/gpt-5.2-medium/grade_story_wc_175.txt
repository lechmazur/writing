<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is vivid—his “esoteric realist” creed shows in measurable acts (rope, reed, notebook) rather than label-speak. The contradiction between saving butterflies and accepting erasure is embodied when he tightens the notebook cord until it “held firm again,” a micro-choice that pays the cost of remembrance. The only drag: the technicians remain names, not pressures, so the relational crucible is absent and the final voice-break feels slightly under-cued.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reeds’ “steady clack” replaces the 1952 beacon’s stutter, reconfiguring migration’s rhythm with felt cost—the frames are already being dismantled. Causal chain holds: failed beacon → wing discovery → reed metronome → monarch alignment. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“grotto… above the cloud sea”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (frames, cloth, names, wing) tightens once and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s thin soil and cloud sea directly constrain stake depth: “stakes shallow and meant to fall.” Marigold cloth and reed percussion are tactile tools, not postcard flora, guiding butterfly orientation. The weather-station ruin supplies the historical seam that charges the ending flag. Micro-setting (notebook cord, moth wing) functions as handled geography, constraining the final knot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a human steady a vanishing migration?—tightens once when the gust snaps a frame and forces Arin to swap static signal for living metronome. Cost is visible: he sacrifices permanence, voices the forgotten names, and accepts erasure at sunset. No reversal, but the cadence shift from broken 1952 beacon to uninterrupted reed clack narrows options to transient stewardship only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: transience as the only honest memorial. The marigold cloth reappears as a “shy flag of remembrance,” reweighting earlier signals into an act of letting-go. No moral is stated; the final image of an empty sky listens back to the cadence shift. Subtext in the technicians’ silence and the intact wing reframes failure as continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Arin’s perceptual filter: sunlight “slow blushes,” cloth “hovered just above,” sound as “living metronome.” Syntax lengthens during calm, fragments under gust. No head-hopping; the technicians’ interior is withheld, as is proper. Diction—“esoteric realist,” “interrupted cadence”—is character-bound, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “orange dots… like sparks from a hidden fire” compresses scale and motion. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed risk—“opaque as parchment” beside “blushed when it met the light”—but the wing’s materiality justifies both metaphors and the closure beat is untouched. Rhythm modulates with breeze vs. stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of lepidopterist fieldwork with ephemeral land-art feels fresh; the 1952 lantern failure repurposed as acoustic beacon is a specific, non-obvious turn. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the sky “listens” without anthropomorphic excess because the reed cadence has been earned. Could swap names and place, but the integration of insect navigation science with memorial practice is particular enough to resist full transplant.</comment>
