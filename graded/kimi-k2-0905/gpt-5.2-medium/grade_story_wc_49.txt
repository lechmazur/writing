<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marn’s interiority is vivid—his imagining the vine as “a living wire” is concrete and particular—but the emotional contradiction demanded for 9+ never surfaces; he proceeds with serene confidence and encounters no internal resistance. The final “smiling” exit feels unearned because no flaw or cost is registered inside him. The keepers’ shame is asserted, not dramatized, so the relationship crucible remains inert. Still, his embodied tinkering choices do advance the rite, satisfying the basic arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crank is handed off, the latch clicks, and the orchard’s new song is the felt cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spun story-thread tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when are clear by line 5. One minor loop: “harvest moon” is named three times in the first 100 words without new information, but this does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vine-as-wire and the crank-harp function as micro-setting that directly constrain Marn’s tactics; their evolving states are tracked in tactile detail. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Marn notices clinks, damp light, and sap applause because they serve his tinkering goal. Spatial choreography is clean—circle of stones, trunk scar, canopy—supporting the final communal breath. Weather and light evolve with the beat sequence, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trees no longer know when to give”—is signaled early and tightens when the orchard’s silence resists Marn’s first spinning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the communal inhale: without the keepers’ breath the tool is useless, foreclosing solo-hero resolution. Cost is present but diffuse: the moon departs, the crank is relinquished, yet no personal loss is dramatized for Marn. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies sufficiently; a sharper personal price would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is a living repair that requires communal breath, not solo invention. The vine’s final hum reweights the opening “verdict” hush into shared responsibility. No moral is stated; the image of the youngest keeper turning the crank offers quiet resonance. The absence of any character’s internal contradiction keeps the thematic charge slightly cerebral rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Marn’s perceptual signature—seed pearls, spider-silk mist, sap applause—without head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer breathless clauses during spinning, then short beats at the hand-off. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is kept in character by the tinkerer’s fondness for dream-tools.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied and read-aloud smooth; sentences advance both image and causality. One scaffold pair: “the contraption looked like a child had tried to copy a harp from a dream, but Marn knew dreams were where the truest tools begin” restates the same insight; trimming the second clause would tighten. Metaphors stay coherent within the orchard’s physics. No filter-verb clusters or loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “song-as-suture” mechanic feels fresh, and the communal inhale as ignition avoids lone-genius cliché. Yet the forgotten-song restoration trope is familiar; the piece leans on lush execution rather than conceptual surprise. Specificity of the vine-wire and starlight jars saves it from generic pastoral. A bolder personal cost or moral ambiguity would elevate risk.</comment>
