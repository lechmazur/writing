<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “carefully reckless” paradox is lived: she measures risk, hides the codex, then publicly bleeds for trust. Interiority stays concrete—ink darkening under vows, discord stinging skin—never drifting into label-speak. The final hand-off of the ink well shows earned change: secrecy becomes shared stewardship, cost paid in reputational ruin and raw shame felt by all. What keeps her from 9.0 is the slight off-stage feel of Ilyon’s parallel betrayal; his voice is less embodied, muting the crucible between them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hidden codex → ruptured trust → vow-ink ritual → public confession → re-braided promises. Orientation lands by line 5; the midnight vault remains the single continuous scene. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the codex’s power is redefined, the archive’s social contract rewritten, the ink well passed as perpetual price. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; every beat either narrows option or raises cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive is not backdrop but instrument: cedar air, quartz lamp, sealed drawers that hiss when opened constrain how sound travels and vows are heard. Micro-setting—the ink well, tuning fork, snarled vellum—functions as geography inside the vault, determining ritual choreography. Weather (last summer storm) is more than mood; its rattling windows cue temporal urgency and acoustic cover. Only the brief corridor mention drifts toward white space, barely nicking the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of trust after silence—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the ink darkens under each spoken pledge, making every subsequent word irreversible. The single meaningful turn occurs at chord-resolution: the codex does not erase names but the gaps between promises, forcing a collective recommitment with visible shame cost. Pressure escalates through because/therefore linkage; no coincidence rescues them. The price—permanent vulnerability and shared custody of a binding artifact—lands on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: language as covenant, silence as erasure, trust as audible harmony. Subtext lives in gesture—ink clearing only when pledges are mutual—and in the final image of a “tentative melody” they must keep playing. Ambiguity is meaningful: the codex can still enslave, but now they must police it together. No closing moral, only a charged poise that reweights every prior withheld word.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature—“scripts the way musicians read scores,” “script kinked and knotted”—is linguist-specific and sustained. Syntax flexes with pressure: long clauses for dread, staccato beats for ritual steps. No head-hopping; when Ilyon speaks Sava we hear it through Mara’s sensory filter. The near-omission of dialogue keeps voice pure; the single line of Sava rings as ritual action, not conversation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical: “promises had started to sound like paper in a fire” compresses months of betrayal into one audible image. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stake, object, or atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned—ink, sound, knot—so metaphors braid rather than clash. A single hairline slip—“corridor no one wanted to cross” faintly clichéd—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy of linguistic truth-music is not new, but grounding it in extinct-language archival science and a vow-ink ritual that literally drinks voices feels freshly synthesized. The “carefully reckless” trait, the ink well that tunes from clear to midnight and back, and the codex that erases inter-personal space rather than names all twist familiar tropes into specific, irreplicable objects. Risk is taken and paid off: the magic system is revealed at the exact moment it rewrites social reality. The story would collapse if any named element were swapped.</comment>
