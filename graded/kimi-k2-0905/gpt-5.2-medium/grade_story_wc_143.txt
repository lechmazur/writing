<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the iodine-clock ritual and the covert photograph mission; the contradictory pull between duty and private witness is felt every time she cracks an ampoule. Eli’s quiet resistance—offering the sand grain, deciding to keep walking—gives the relationship a crucible that crystallizes in the shared hush. Cost is visible: the sky surrenders, the crater is already fenced by future lights, the grain and negative are pocketed as relics. Interiority stays concrete; only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling in “ashamed that a report…was just her cover.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final photograph and the grain’s burial beside the negative reweight the entire night into an elegy whose cost is the sky’s loss. Causal chain holds—each chemical strip triggers a concrete camera act; the hourglass gift seeds the parting image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One persistent constraint—the approaching tracking lights—shapes every tactical timing choice and charges the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Summit geography is tracked without drift—gate, road, dome rim, crater shadow, wind drop—each spot licenses a specific act (tripod placement, strip priming, shared sky-gazing). The hourglass grain and iodine vials serve as micro-setting that constrains choice: pocketing the grain, waiting for color change. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—scorched pine, glitter of melted metal, hush sensed through birds and towers. Final image reuses the summit’s sleeping-eye dome to refract the theme of surveillance; no environmental detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“last untouched dark sky”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each sand-fall and shutter click. One meaningful deepening: the third chemical command “WAIT FOR HUSH” forces shared stillness that forecloses further resistance; options narrow to recording the surrender. Cost is legible: the sky is already lost, the negative is only evidence. Agency stays with Mara’s choices to prime, shoot, and pocket; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of witness versus instrumentation emerges through the crater inspection that is secretly a sky funeral; no explicit thesis is stated. The grain, the strip, and the hourglass form a quiet constellation about time running out—reframed when the grain becomes relic alongside the negative. Subtext in Eli’s “someone had to watch the instruments even if they watch nothing beautiful” carries the ethical weight. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature—chemical smells, shutter clicks, starch-ink logic—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens during strip reveals; diction carries scientific precision yet yields to lyrical compression at climax. Dialogue is sparse, indirection-loaded: Eli’s sand-grain offer and Mara’s chemistry-trust line reveal worldview, not exposition. Voice modulation under pressure is evident in the breath-held final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, paragraphs shorten as hush approaches. Figurative language is selective—“observatory like a sleeping eye”—and never clutters the high-pressure final beat. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density is high (one sentence often does description, interior, and stakes). One minor filter-verb cluster “she thought of the lone sand grain” could be trimmed, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crater-inspector who moonlights as sky-documentarian is fresh; pairing her with an hourglass-wielding nightwatch marries space-age tech and pre-modern timekeeping without gimmickry. Chemical-message timing device is a concrete, non-obvious solution to memory lapses under fatigue. The story’s risk—quiet elegy instead of dramatic sabotage—pays off because the stakes stay personal and the cost is pocket-sized. Specificity of 1969 tracking-light anxiety prevents template drift.</comment>
