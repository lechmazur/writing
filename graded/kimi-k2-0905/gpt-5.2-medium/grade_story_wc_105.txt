<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s synesthetic ear and grief-forged mission are vivid; the moment she slips the aid into her pocket she crystallizes a costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete, but the brother’s death is recounted more than re-lived, muting the emotional bruise that could have pushed this into 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the melted brass re-casts betrayal into future protection, cost legible in “tiny weight now carried two truths.” Causal chain (collect absences → imprint silence → extract confession) holds; only the late insertion of “harbor magistrate” feels like a teleporting prop, barely nicking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse-as-pressure-chamber is tactile: salt-tolerant grafts breathe while wreck-ribs groan, constraining Mara’s dive schedule and charging the final forge image. Micro-setting (Jory’s belt buckle) becomes the literal seed of the device—irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the sound of trust breaking”—tightens when the prototype forces Rell’s confession; one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is visible (Rell’s yellow sheen drains, Mara forfeits private vengeance for communal justice), though the off-page magistrate slightly dilutes the immediate price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory as mutable metal emerges through action: forging, imprinting, melting again—no thesis statements. Final image of blossoms “dividing with blind faith” reweights forgiveness as biological necessity, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches Mara’s synesthetic ear; rhythm swells and contracts with auroral light. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s artisan lexicon—“sliver of brass,” “housings for other ears”—though one clause (“the impact of memories was that they could either rot you or forge you”) edges toward aphorism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “She fed it charcoal mixed with the gray dust of ruined hull planks” seeds setting, process, and metaphor in one breath. Occasional adjective clusters (“battered marvel of the greenhouse”) flirt with purple but never stall momentum; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic underwater luthier who weaponizes silence via bespoke hearing aids—specific, risky, inevitable. The wreck-ring orchard feels newly invented yet logically necessary; transformation test fails if relocated to generic lab or city loft.</comment>
