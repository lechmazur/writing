<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Samir’s interiority is vivid—his vow to “cradle empathy in arms of steel” is embodied every time the iron frame makes strangers flinch and he answers with deliberate warmth. The contradiction between weapon-like steel and gentleness is held in scene, not asserted, and drives his micro-choice to pocket the tessera and invite Lina onto the stone. Lina’s shift from contempt to complicity is traced through bodily detail (spit, staggered step, whisper) and crystallizes when she names her cousin. Cost is felt: Samir will keep reliving the fire, Lina must guard the boy she now feeds; both paths narrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore—tessera pried free therefore names are spoken therefore Grasp is buckled. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Samir… walked there at dawn”). Closure is a Decisive Change: the plaza is renamed on-page, survivors become Keepers, cousin is alive and shackled to bread; cost is the perpetual retrocognitive trap Samir accepts. No teleporting props; the tessera’s travel from minaret to groove is tracked. One transition (dawn → evening) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The plaza’s white-rinsed stones, chipped mosaic, and shattered sky are filtered through Samir’s mason eye; the iron frame functions as mobile micro-setting that constrains every greeting. Blue tessera reappears as river-depth flash and finally clicks into the groove, reweighting the place-name. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, pry, pocket, stand, invite; bodies stay tracked. Weather (ash-rinsed dawn → evening truce) evolves with emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can mercy survive vengeance? Pressure tightens once: Lina’s recognition of her cousin collapses binary revenge/forgive into Samir’s third path. The Grasp’s design literalizes the stake—steel that both restrains and feeds—forcing the boy’s first public act of restitution. Cost is visible: cousin’s wrists locked, Lina’s chew “tasted like ash,” Samir’s future visions unchanged. Agency stays with Samir; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of radical mercy emerges through the Grasp’s engineering and the renaming act, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: bread slid into steel tray speaks louder than apology. Final image of three people chewing under shattered sky reweights “Haven of Hands” from ironic to earned. Ambiguity remains—visions will return, law may still harden—yet the stance is crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Samir’s perceptual bias—stone constellations, pulse of foreign prayer—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during retrocognitive freeze, then shortens for the click of cuffs. Word choice (“aberrant mercy,” “warmth that felt cold”) sustains oxymoron without self-consciousness. Dialogue is sparse, indirection intact: Lina’s bitter laugh answers Samir’s quiet invitation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in 800 words, both grounded (steel cradle, bread tray). No synonym loops; “Grasp” and “Keepers” accrue meaning through re-use. Final line (“the past loosen”) is crisp, no scaffold. Copy-clean: tessera/tessera, minaret/minaret consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The Grasp—an embrace that cuffs while feeding—is a fresh moral technology; no genre analogue carries bread in the restraint. Retrocognition as helpless historiography rather than wish-fulfillment twist reframes trauma work. Renaming survivors “Keepers” via mosaic flare converts architectural fragment into civic rebirth. Risk is high yet coherence intact; the concept could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
