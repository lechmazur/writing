<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s listening gift is embodied in chalk taps and negative-frame alignments; the diary reveal turns her private quest into an inherited ethical burden. The final renunciation—submitting a false map to keep the chamber secret—carries visible cost: she forfeits professional credit and risks legal sanction. Interior contradiction is present yet thin: we are told she fears civic exploitation but never see her weigh a single tourist’s face or profit figure. Still, the beat where she “lets her mother’s apology answer” crystallizes endurance as stance, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chord she plays into the wall reweights every prior echo, sealing the chamber under a deliberate lie. Causality holds: grandfather’s waxed negative → matched intervals → bricked door → archived voices → her choice to conceal. Orientation is swift—salt fog, ivy, collapsed entrance within 60 words. One minor loop: “the corridor answered” repeats twice in fifty words, dulling the escalation beat, but the lens stays accumulative-textural and pays off.</comment>

<comment>The ivy is not scenery; it hides the breach she slips through, muffles footfalls, and finally swallows the secret again. Ceramic plates in the vent chamber act as tuning forks, translating wind into ancestral speech—setting literally voices the dead. Spatial choreography is immaculate: fireplace → passage → bricked door → narrow chamber, each move tracked without drift. Environment constrains the final choice: only the ivy-covered ruin allows covert access to seal the vents undetected.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether to broadcast or protect the archived voices—emerges at the diary discovery and tightens when drones hover for a tourist report. One meaningful deepening: the council’s past refusal to open the chamber mirrors today’s commercial pressure, forcing her complicity. Cost is legible: she trades truth for guardianship, accepting personal risk. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the chord unlocks the door; a second external threat beat would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—heritage as living, selective responsibility—emerges through acoustic metaphor: not all memories should be amplified. Subtext resides in the act of listening itself; her final silent chord is an unspoken promise that resists the city’s appetite for curated nostalgia. No moralizing sentence declares the thesis; the bricked door and falsified map reweight the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers: future heirs may yet betray her choice, keeping the ethical question open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Liora’s ear: “the corridor answered in overlapping taps.” Diction is precise—corridor echo cartographer, salt fog, ceramic plates—without slipping into catalog voice. Rhythm accelerates during the unlock sequence: short clauses mimic staccato taps, then lengthen into murmuring plates. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction bullet is waived; internal monologue avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering thought as sensory action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs atmosphere, motion, and emotional tilt—“wind from the overheated city pulsed through, the plates spoke in layered murmurs.” No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. A single paraphrase loop—“she listened… she recognized voices”—costs −0.2. Final image of dusk ivy and unstruck chord is lean, letting the after-echo do the work. Clean copy; no tense drift or homophone errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Acoustic archaeology feels fresh, yet the story’s deeper ingenuity is ethical: a heritage site whose value lies in selective silence, not curated display. The film-negative-as-tuning-key marries analog photography to sound physics in a way that is both plausible and thematically apt—light and sound as twins. Risk is taken by refusing the triumphant reveal; the protagonist chooses erasure, upending expected narrative reward. Specificity of the ivy-choked, salt-fogged academy keeps the concept from feeling like a thought experiment.</comment>
