<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—trained to treat grief as datum yet scalded by salt-smoke—grounds a believable, embodied arc; the final vow to publish with redactions is earned by the retrocognitive cost (palms arranging kelp, childhood accent hijacked). Micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to spell with shells, deciding “archives are doors”) crystallize values, though the single-scene compression keeps the flaw/competence balance more asserted than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary surfaces only after the protagonist accepts archival ethics with visible cost—retrocognitive release and the hiss of dunes. Causal chain holds: letters → zeppelin → vision → parley → price paid; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (county attic, zeppelin coast, dawn drop), and the final image reweights the premise (“steady thrum” overhead = truth can’t be buried again).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Black lagoon, salt-grass kerosene air, and shell-alphabet constrain the parley mechanics; the obsidian mirror “drinking starlight” charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across attic → airship → beach → lagoon; no floating rooms. Sensory selection stays urgent—clicking water, wind tearing coat—filtered through archivist’s cataloguing gaze. Environment directly shapes the choice to kneel and spell, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover diary without re-victimizing community—tightens when Lila’s voice demands parley, foreclosing grab-and-go option. One meaningful deepening: realization that “truth in tension” requires redaction consent. Cost is legible (retrocognitive captivity, childhood accent usurped), though escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed. Coincidence (zeppelin captain agrees) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—archive as living door, not grave—emerges through shell-alphabet, salt-smoke scent, and final redaction vow; no explicit thesis states this. Subtext in the parley (lagoon ripples = consent negotiation) reweights the reader’s idea of evidence. Ambiguity lingers: will redaction truly shield the living? Emotional aftereffect is concrete—the hiss of dunes after reel release—avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries archivist’s cataloguing diction (“treat paper as evidence and grief as a datum”) yet cracks under retrocognitive intrusion: syntax fragments when “the past smelled like kerosene.” Rhythm modulates—long Latinate clauses yield to shell/kelp staccato during parley. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent (notices marginalia, smells smoke, tracks tide). Compression (“retrocognitively trapped”) is taught early and paid off at lagoon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “envelope seal had burned my fingers with a scent of salt and smoke” does triple duty (sensory, foreshadow, stakes). Metaphors stay coherent—lagoon as “mirror so dark it seemed to drink starlight” supports closure. One paraphrase loop spotted (“the truth…like a rope pulled tight” echoes later) but it doesn’t stall the beat. No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs anchor sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of civil-rights archive, zeppelin library, and retrocognitive parley feels fresh yet inevitable; the shell-alphabet cipher grows organically from coastal geography and civil-rights stealth tactics. Risk—time-travel via tactile evidence—could have felt gimmicky but is grounded in archival ethos. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic treasure hunt; specificity of tin box under obsidian lagoon is irreplaceable.</comment>
