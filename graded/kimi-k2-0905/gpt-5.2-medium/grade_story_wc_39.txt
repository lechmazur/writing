<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sato’s contradictory hunger for coins versus communal healing is embodied in the tactile jar ritual; the final offer of stories for music dramatizes a visible cost (his cup of names). Interiority stays concrete, though “positively wistful” risks label-speak twice. The arc from scavenger to bridge-builder is earned because each sound-capture beat progressively trades solitude for exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared dawn playback crystallizes a new social contract, felt when coins arrive “with names and dates.” Causal chain intact—each jarred sound mechanically frees the spring—though the widow’s late sister back-story is confessed rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 4; single transition from loft to shore is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sea-warped loft, tide hiss, rope creak, and gull-carved box constrain every sonic experiment; the final lantern-like row of jars re-images the loft as communal hearth. Selective sensory triad—salt, rust, bell-tone—filters through Sato’s scavenger ear without tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the box’s jammed teeth) directly shapes the climax choice to feed it live sounds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can salvaged noise re-open village speech?—tightens when the music box demands ever-scarcer sounds, forcing Sato to barter his private ritual for public stories. One meaningful escalation: releasing the church-bell hiss publicly at dawn, trading anonymity for accountability. Cost is visible: the once-private poet now stands exposed between generations, pockets ringing with traceable coins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges through the jar-to-jar accumulation of discarded voices; no character moralizes. The lonesome splendor melody reweights grief from private wound to shared inheritance without sermon. Subtext resides in the unspoken sister’s name—never voiced, only heard—allowing ambiguity to linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Sato’s scavenger sensorium; perceptual signature notices “tarnished coins” and “rain-warped boards” with tinkerer precision. Rhythm swells and contracts with tide breath, mirroring the loosening spring. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken; compressed diction (“feral loft,” “penny poems”) teaches pattern early and holds to final lantern image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—sound, emotion, and metaphor in one coil: “the tide hiss jar went first… the spring loosened, as though the box remembered.” No loops or scaffold; occasional alliteration (“salt-stung,” “lonesome splendor”) stays purposeful. One mixed risk: “positively wistful smile” edges on cliché, but the adverb is later redeemed when the smile never reaches his eyes—self-contradiction shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sound-capture-as-currency and music-box-as-oral-archive fuse into fresh folkloric tech; the concept commits fully without exposition dumps. Village silence after cannery closure grounds the fantastical jars in socio-economic grit. The final communal playback feels inevitable yet non-obvious, a synthesis that would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
