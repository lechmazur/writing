<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism-singer’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” drives every choice; the embodied listening, the refusal to shame Mara, the final decision to let raw voices air are all micro-choices that cost him institutional protection. Interiority stays concrete—sound has “weight and temperature”—and the closing renunciation of curated comfort is earned. Only the council’s off-stage demand feels slightly abstract, keeping this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each refracted fragment layers civic distrust until the final chorus forces officials to answer aloud—an undeniable before/after. The soot lens is introduced, taught, and paid off as the tool that turns polished narrative into gritty echo, landing a Conceptual Repricing with visible social cost. Causality is clean: because they expose the raw archive, the pilgrimage becomes conversation, not product. No orientation drift; velvet baffles and copper throats anchor us by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Laboratory’s velvet baffles, copper throats, and golden shadows aren’t scenery; they are the acoustic crucible that lets flawed voices gain mass. The soot lens’s “small sun in shadow” is a micro-setting that literally refracts stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless—lens mounted, bell run, crowd reaches into textured air. Environment constrains the final tactic: only this chamber can make doubt audible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can unfiltered civic pain be aired without breaking the project—is signaled early and tightened when Mara admits doctored reports. The refracted archive is the one beat that forecloses retreat; councilors must respond live, price paid in credibility. Pressure grows by accretion of voices, not twist—perfect for the chosen lens. Cost is legible: the bell-ringer sacrifices funding security to keep the sound raw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the acoustic metaphor: connection is not data but shared vulnerability you can cup in your hands. The final image—officials hearing their own doubts in textured air—reweights “efficiency” without moralizing. No thematic echo; the story trusts the lens to do the talking. Ambiguity lingers: comfort is forfeited, yet healing is not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is filtered through a synesthetic ear: silence is “broken into colors,” overtones “propelled.” Syntax lengthens during listening beats, shortens under council threat, mirroring acoustic tension. No head-hop; Mara’s interior is accessed only through her loosening posture and whisper. Distinct perceptual signature holds to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet musical—“golden shadows pooled,” “grit of real streets”—without metaphor pile-up. Each sentence advances: mounting the lens, feeding fragments, hearing sigh. No loops or scaffold; “refracted” recurs only when the physics demands. Final clause “learning that connection has texture” is the sole abstract line, but it is earned by sixty prior seconds of tactile sound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “artificial pilgrimage” trope is flipped: instead of AR spectacle, the route becomes a confessional echo chamber where curated stories are sabotaged by their own rough refraction. Acoustic physics as emotional archaeology feels fresh, yet inevitable once the soot lens is introduced. Risk—letting the officials publicly fail—pays off in civic texture rather than catharsis. Synthesis of sound-science and social healing is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
