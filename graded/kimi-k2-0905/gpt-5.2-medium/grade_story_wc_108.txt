<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s fear-as-compass and adaptive hiding are dramatized in embodied beats (shaking masked on roofs, charcoal rubbing on cast). The final choice to broadcast trembling instead of suppressing it credibly reverses her survival strategy with visible cost—signing her real name while still holding the child’s hand. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. The boy’s pain could be filtered more through her body rather than reported, but the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of file → flight to library → decryption → public confession, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—she forfeits anonymity and safety, on-page in the signed call-sheet moment. Orientation is clean by 80 words; no teleporting props. One causal leap: the shell somehow contains an edited confession; not prepped, but the story teaches its magical realism early, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rusted library set is tactile—orange dust, moth-shredded film—yet always filtered through Mara’s goal of finding proof. The seashell micro-setting constrains her final tactic (hold to mic) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear across single location. Weather (starlight through cracked roof) mirrors stakes without overt symbolism. One micro-slip: “projected on the wall” appears without prior light source, but beat is legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ownership of identity versus studio erasure—signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each decryption beat. Pressure tightens when decrypted names foreclose the option of private escape; public exposure becomes the only path. Cost is legible: she trades lifelong anonymity for justice. No coincidence resolves; crew turn is earned by on-page playback. Could use one earlier glimpse that the crew are within earshot to sharpen the final pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges from concrete reversal: weaponizing the very tremors she was paid to hide. No explicit thesis; final image of signing her real name while still trembling reweights all prior hiding. Child’s cast and shell accumulate meaning without forced recurrence. Moral complexity remains—she still uses a child’s pain, yet accepts that cost. Final resonance lands in the ear of the crew, not in narrator assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a stunt-performer’s kinetic precision—“burn cleanly,” “rigging terms,” “call sheet”—without jargon overload. Syntax tightens under stress: fragments when the file is opened, longer breaths in the library. No head-hopping; boy’s interior stays opaque, as required. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for stunt-double idiom, but it occurs in a low-pressure beat and does not contaminate climax.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: charcoal rubbing “like a gravestone” does triple duty (tactile, gothic, death motif). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—moths as shredded film—without purple stacking. One minor scaffold: “the certainty that trembled in my chest” is abstract; could compress to “my chest shook with certainty.” Closure line is clean, strong verb—“stepped into a future that I authored.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Studio-face-replacement noir is familiar, but the stunt-double vantage, phobia inversion, and seashell-as-recorder feel freshly synthesized. The decryption of a child’s cast turns a medical prop into palimpsest evidence—specific, memorable. Risk taken in magical shell pays off by charging the final microphone beat. Without these elements the plot collapses, passing transformation test. One echo of “we will not hide anymore” edges manifesto, but context justifies.</comment>
