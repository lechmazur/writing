<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—steady mask vs. crawling fear—remains embodied and specific; the coat, the belly-crawl, the wax reset all dramatize hierarchy of values. The final choice to trigger chaos rather than warn openly is earned by prior failures and costs her the truce, visible in blood-rinsed boards. No label-speak; competence balanced by genuine struggle. Father stays off-stage, so relationship crucible not tested on page; headcount stays within default.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each failed wax drop tightens risk → forces new tactic → accumulates to the tin-cup sabotage that kills the bargain. Closure is a Decisive Change: sheriff’s trust shatters, father’s routes saved, Mara stranded under pier with blood-price legible. Cost felt in “tide rinse blood from the boards.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rotting pier, tar sweat, lantern glass, mussel shells—selective sensory triage filtered through Mara’s stealth priorities. The watch fob and iron skiff chain function as micro-setting that directly enables the recording beat; tide and splinters punish her body, guiding crawl trajectory. Spatial choreography clean across three attempts. Final image of gull cry over rinsed boards reweights the whole night. Environment constrains every tactic; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—father’s life vs. silence truce—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through each wax failure: options narrow from barrel to piling to skiff chain; each retry risks exposure. Final tin-cup clatter is protagonist-activated, foreclosing negotiation path with visible blood cost. One meaningful tightening suffices; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust’s fragility emerges through the wax sliver that can’t lie—betrayal literalized as vibration. Subtext in tap-code ring rhythm and Lorne’s soft laugh carries more weight than spoken words. Final image of gull over rinsed pier offers resonant reconfiguration: silence restored, but now it means danger, not peace. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether Mara has merely delayed chains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—sound of nails, smell of tar, crab-shadow drag—without head-hop. Syntax compresses under stress (“She swallowed her frustration, warmed a spare wax sliver…”) yet keeps maritime lexicon. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Filter verbs scarce; prose breathes with paragraph variation that mirrors tide rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High density: “lantern glass and wet coin” does two jobs of image and economy. One mixed metaphor check—“lanterns rocked like tired fireflies” slightly jars with maritime palette but does not touch closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; prop tracking (fob, wax, chain) stays exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sound-as-evidence premise feels fresh; wax impression of betrayal is specific, not CSI trope. Pirate market under pier reverses usual swashbuckling glare into hush-governed noir. Risk taken with almost zero dialogue; tension carried by tap-code and body language. Could swap names and still work, but sensory palette and wax mechanic are particular enough to leave residue.</comment>
