<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s guilt is embodied in the fevered synesthesia of wind-in-ribs; the lie about the wind speed is a concrete micro-choice that keeps reverberating. Mara’s “fault-tolerant” stance is shown, not labeled, when she smudges the notebook to make room for unspoken error. The final confession to Eli is credibly awkward—shoulders stay stiff—so the emotional cost lands. Minor slip: “swallowed truth” is repeated so often it starts to feel diagnostic rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s confession reframes the earlier lie and the station’s static-filled silence becomes a charged poise. Causal linkage holds—false report → iced door → fever → smudge → confession—each step narrows options. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 4. One hairline wobble: Eli’s survival is revealed in a subordinate clause, slightly damping the cost moment, but the loneliness already incurred remains palpable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mountain weather station is no postcard: the anemometer’s click migrates into the narrator’s chest, making instrument and body one micro-setting. The DO NOT TRUST THE WHITE note on the botanical print directly steers the smudge action, so the object constrains choice. Aurora light is filtered through grief rather than painted on top. Spatial choreography is clean—door ices shut, radiosonde balloons ascend, bodies track believably.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—exact weight of the swallowed lie—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the smudge makes the false reading physically disappear. The narrator’s agency drives every turn: lie → conceal → smudge → confess. Cost is visible in the trembling finger at the petal and the stiff-shouldered forgiveness front. One minor slack: rescue coincidence could have complicated rather than eased the pressure, but the story keeps focus on the internal price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of precise measurement—wind, guilt, truth—all wobble like auroral curtains. The botanical warning about white (snow? truth? absolution?) reweights at closure when the narrator chooses impure confession over clean erasure. No moralizing line tells us lies are bad; instead the station’s static becomes the moral sound. Ambiguity lingers: forgiveness arrives “in fronts,” still icy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—aurora “spilled over the ridgeline in quiet curtains,” radiosonde balloons “heavier than the tongue.” Syntax lengthens and breathes under fever, then tightens during confession. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is only inferred through gesture, maintaining distance. One clause drifts toward textbook—“truths behave like pressure systems”—but the surrounding texture keeps it afloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from fevered cadence to spare confession without template repetition. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—wind through spruce, graphite fog—each image reappears to reweight meaning. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Proofing is clean; pronouns track flawlessly through the two-character scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fault-tolerant oracle who edits truth by smudging field notes is a fresh synthesis of climate science and emotional absolution. Aurora as grief-light and static as moral residue feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk is taken in slow lyric escalation rather than twist, and it pays off in the final charged poise. Minor deduction for familiar “confession heals” arc, but the meteorological frame transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s fault-tolerance is dramatized when she smudges the notebook to host multiple forecasts, directly enabling the narrator’s confession. Her peripheral awareness catches the trembling finger, turning observation into tactical pressure. Without her smudge, the lie stays intact; closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Botanical illustration appears early, guides the petal-pointing beat, and its DO NOT TRUST THE WHITE warning reweights at confession—white snow, white lie, white absolution all become suspect. Removing it deletes the concrete interface between guilt and measurement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Swaying certainties shape every tactical move: the false wind reading, the smudge that blurs fact/fiction, the final auroral ripple that refuses fixed weight. The concept is the story’s gyroscope; remove it and the moral calculus falls still.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Peripheral awareness is shown when Mara notes the finger tremble rather than the petal choice, forcing the narrator to feel watched. The trait costs her nothing visible, so it tops out below 7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The smudge erases the false wind entry, materializing the narrator’s desire to unweigh the lie. It is the decisive physical act that makes confession possible; without it, the notebook retains the original guilt-anchor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>“Occupying margins where models disagree” is voiced late but is instantiated in the smudge that keeps contradictory forecasts legible. The method’s mechanics matter once, mid-story, so integration is solid but not pervasive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Station instruments—anemometer, radiosonde, barometer—supply the lie’s medium and the final static silence. The iced-shut door is physical consequence of the false report; setting is antagonist, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Post-fever timeframe creates urgency: confession must come before Eli returns, tightening the final beat. However, clock ticks are implicit rather than tracked, limiting top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The swallowed truth (false wind report) is the stake that drives smudge and confession. Its weight is measured by tremor, fever, and static—felt on the page, not merely declared.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Auroral sorrow permeates imagery from first paragraph to final shifting sky, modulating from grief to tentative relief without breaking coherence. Tone is the emotional barometer of the piece; remove it and the moral pressure dissipates.</comment>
