<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—self-protection vs. offering witnesses to grief—are alive in every beat; the ash-handling micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (father-memory vs. survival). The final softening of the inspector is foreshadowed by her own masked breath, so the crystallized emotion lands as earned cost. Only the inspector’s turn feels fractionally convenient; a hair more setup would remove the tiny wobble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s last creak halts time, ash hangs in the vanishing light, and Lira’s next portrait is both defiance and acceptance—cost is undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (porcelain chime, ash dust, perspective lines) tightens the stake until the inspector’s flinch reweights safety as shared vulnerability. No causality gaps; even the father memory is anchored to the present rocking motion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gallery’s forced perspective literally narrows Lira’s exit options while the skylight draft animates the rocking chair—environment dictates tactics. Ash, porcelain shards, and charcoal function as micro-setting that constrains gesture and charges the final scatter. Every sensory pick is filtered through her risk-calibrated attention; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be made visible without lethal exposure—tightens when boots approach; the ash through the sieve is the irreversible trade-off. One meaningful deepening: the inspector’s recognition moment converts external threat into internal cost, foreclosing the option to destroy the portrait. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of safe witness: the vanishing point illusion, mirage motif, and ash testimony all orbit the same question without sermon. Final image reconfigures “safety” as something one scatters, not possesses—earned through particulars, not stated. Ambiguity lingers: is the inspector’s softness mercy or future evidence—complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lira’s perceptual signature—every noticed detail (river smell, report-card paper texture) serves her risk-filter. Porcelain-mask syntax fragments mimic breath-chime; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses as boots approach, then exhales into the final long sentence—voice modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“night sky being made”) and paid off in the ash-scatter finale. No mixed metaphors or register drift; high information density without purple compression. Clean copy, varied paragraph rhythm, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Charcoal portrait ash scatterer” is a fresh occupational lens on disappeared-person art; the vanishing-point gallery literalizes forced perspective as survival strategy. Risk—using father’s ash as pigment—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable: inspector recognition could only happen after ash settles on the mouth. No close echoes; specificity anchors novelty.</comment>
