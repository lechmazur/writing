<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing wax, following cracks—so the motivation stays embodied. Ilyas’s ghost-tutor status is accepted without exposition because the narrator’s calm need aligns with their shared ritual. The final act of slipping documents into the inspector’s folder crystallizes a value hierarchy: heritage over personal safety, cost shown by the landlord’s implied threat. Interior contradiction is light but present: the narrator both relies on and will lose Ilyas, a loss felt when he “faded into the mortar.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the preservation order reweights every prior lie, felt cost in the building’s “long wooden sigh” and Ilyas’s disappearance. Causal chain holds—seal → clay → hidden permits → switch with inspector—each step narrows options. Orientation is anchored within 60 words (roof, meteors, herb pots). No lens ambiguity; the ending is legible under Causal drive with persistent constraint: the narrator now must live inside the official story they forged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, meteor shower, and parapet carvings are not backdrop but tools: the meteor light lets the wax impression “look like fresh mortar,” guiding the next action. Spatial choreography is clean—gate, pots, parapet, maintenance room tracked without drift. The dove-and-key motif is handled twice, each time altering possibility. Weather (meteors) times the revelation beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the building—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the cavity shifts the tactic from pleading to forgery. Cost is legible: complicity in document fraud, loss of Ilyas. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal is required. Coincidence (meteor flare) only illuminates, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: language as preservation—Phoenician, steam script, mortar sentences—culminating in the final unspoken “word finally understood.” Subtext in the shared lie with Ilyas: tutelage ends when the student authors their own text. No moralizing; the ending image reweights all prior tea sessions as elegiac. Ambiguity lingers: is the building saved or merely entombed in new official language?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, antiquarian diction—“lintel,” “parapet,” “desk seal”—consistent with the obsession. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under stealth (“I slipped the documents into his folder”). No head-hopping; Ilyas’s dialogue is filtered through the narrator’s perception, maintaining distance control. Compression in “time was the only verb a building understands” is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “meteors stitched white seams across the dark” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language peaks at the wax impression then recedes, preventing clutter. Minor over-modification in “gentle insistence” is the only hairline slip, and it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost linguist helping tenant forge heritage via clay seal—feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of the Phoenician ledger and dove-and-key mark prevents trope recycling. Risk in blending magical realism with municipal bureaucracy pays off: the forged permit scene is both suspenseful and quietly comic. Transformation test fails if relocated: the Dovetail’s hidden vents and rooftop garden are irreplaceable.</comment>
