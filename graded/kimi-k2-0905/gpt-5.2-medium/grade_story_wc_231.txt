<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon’s “softly persistent” manner is dramatized in the way he coaxes the clerk to stay and in the tactile micro-choice of pressing the Edelweiss to the scar-free piling; the clerk’s interior contradiction between bureaucratic duty and reluctant empathy is embodied, not labeled. The final act of speaking the lost name and archiving the packet crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over ownership—at visible cost to Eamon’s already-thick loneliness. The only bar to 9-band is that the clerk’s stake never sharpens into a risk that could fail; his consent feels foregone rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the packet is anchored in the logbook, the name is spoken, and the cost is the clerk’s recognition that Eamon’s isolation is the price of guardianship—“witnessed isolation” lands as Charged Poise. Causal chain holds: because the boutonnière carries alpine cold, Eamon investigates gaps → finds canvas packet → letter demands utterance → clerk speaks → archive created. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One hairline slip: “the rhythm of the pilings” is slightly abstract, but it does not obscure cause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-laminated opal boards, lantern-light picking out rope-scar absences, and the lighthouse beam that can’t warm Eamon are selective, POV-filtered details that guide the search and mirror internal cold. The alpine/salt rope contrast is a concrete constraint that determines where the packet is hidden and charges the final image. Micro-setting (the single unscarred piling) literally stops the investigation and triggers the memory transfer. One tenth off for “opal dock” risking preciousness, but the metaphor is earned by recurrent pearlescence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the stranger’s erased name be restored?—tightens once: from mute absence to spoken memory. The investigation itself is the escalation under a Situational lens; each gap observed (no gulls, no sand, wrong rope) narrows the search field and raises the ethical cost of speaking a name that isn’t theirs. Agency is clerical yet decisive: the clerk could have refused; instead he voices the name and thereby accepts complicity in Eamon’s archive of absences. Price is legible: the final beam exposes Eamon’s unshareable solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as unownable cargo—emerges through the alpine flower that refuses to belong to the coast and the letter that begs to be remembered by someone who can no longer remember himself. Subtext resides in gesture: the empty grip is an offering, not a clue. The final image reweights the premise: archives do not possess histories, they merely anchor them in shared loneliness. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person clerk POV remains stable; perceptual signature is maritime-bureaucratic—he catalogs absences the way he would inventory cargo. Syntax lengthens under lantern-light, then fractures into short clauses when the name is spoken, mirroring the micro-turn. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal versus Eamon’s reported soft persistence; the contrast is clear. Compression (“borrowed memories leave holes”) is taught early and paid off at the packet slide into the logbook.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: information dual-loads (lantern-light both reveals and isolates). Metaphors are coherent—mountain cold vs salt rope—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “softly persistent” appears twice in close proximity; minor scaffold. Rhythm modulates from languid dock sentences to the staccato of naming. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“breathed its beam,” “slid it into”) propel. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the beam do final work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime ghost-story meets alpine memento in a single object; the lighthouse keeper as archivist of unclaimed memories feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—lyric compression, minimal cast, no antagonist—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test fails if relocated: the salt/alpine clash is irreplaceable. One tenth off because “opal dock” flirts with poetic branding, but the image is saved by functional recurrence.</comment>
