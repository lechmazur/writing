<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“jealousy of his ignorance,” “counting unspent chances like coins”—and the final renunciation (“I chose to keep writing”) carries cost. Yet the younger/older self swap is reported more than embodied; we get no contradictory bodily cue during the swap, so the beat feels symbolic rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator’s decision to author rather than become rumor reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-returns and scroll-writing tightens stakes without causal chains—and the final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. One transition (waking→hike→nap) is legible; orientation is anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The birch scroll’s sap-smell and grooves, the moonlit ridge “too sharp,” and the cabin stove create tactile micro-setting that constrains the only available writing surface. Weathered cemetery stones and “pines like witnesses” mirror the internal leak of time. Final image—“write it down”—is charged by the scroll’s earlier sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seize authorship before chronological collapse—tightens when dream-flight lets him outrun the graveyard; the price is accepting perpetual self-division. One meaningful deepening: gratitude to his past self breaks the envy loop and forecloses the option of erasure. Cost is legible: he must keep writing indefinitely, a life-sentence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: narrative is a fence against scheduled death. Subtext lives in the scroll’s “muscle memory of sentences” and the feral nostalgia that hunts rather than misses. Final reconfiguration—author over rumor—avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the un-dated grave still waiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is textured—“air accepted me… like a page torn free”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors lucid-dream slipperiness. Perceptual signature is consistent: time is tasted, smelled as sap, counted as coins. No head-hopping; dream-self POV remains anchored to narrator’s body even during flight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short pulses (“I outflew it”) to longer accumulations without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—no mixed metaphors obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “feral nostalgia… went feral again” costs −0.3; otherwise density is high and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—own grave with future date—could be gimmick, but is transformed through scroll-as-skin and envy-of-past-self tactic. Synthesis of lucid-dream trade with meta-authorial stakes feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in second-person address at ending (“you either become…”) pays off by turning confession into contract.</comment>
