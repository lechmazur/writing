<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid—“dimensionally homesick” is a sharp, embodied ache—but the guardian’s shift from feral sentinel to vulnerable peer happens in a single speech beat; we needed one earlier micro-gesture or withheld hunger to make the wrist-catch moment feel inevitable rather than merciful. Still, the renunciation of escape for shared uncertainty carries a felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pendant’s dulling and the catalog tag “RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP” reweight the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—uncertainty is now a circulating loan, not a breach. Causality holds; every beat of mist thickening or pendant warming is tethered to the guardian’s escalating sniff and the final joint refusal. Orientation is taught by sentence 3, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not backdrop; its mist density literally gates the visionary doorway, forcing the final choice to occur inside the interiorized micro-setting of the narrator’s ribs. Selective sensory triage—frosted roses cutting shadows, paper dust in matted hair—keeps the library-without-walls legible and pressures the stance shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape versus dwelling in uncertainty—tightens once: when the pendant tries to widen the rib-doorway and the duo chooses to “wait at the edge,” foreclosing guaranteed passage. The cost is visible: the pendant dies, the guardian remains unnamed, the narrator wakes still exiled. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the cult’s mistake—treating dawn as a blade—mirrors the guardian’s earlier guarding and the narrator’s urge to cut home free; both learn the boundary is a conversation, not a tool. The final catalog card reconfigures friendship with uncertainty as a borrowable, renewable artifact, not a victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person lyric stays stable; perceptual signature is consistent—“foggy lucidity,” “color that lived just past the last visible wavelength”—and syntax modulates from long breathless clauses to the staccato “wait with me at the edge.” No head-hop; compression is taught early and paid off in the rib-doorway image.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; sentence variety carries the dream cadence without drumbeat loops. One mixed metaphor—“boundary stepped like a cautious animal”—is forgiven because it crystallizes the final conceptual reprice. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn; information density stays high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “feral librarian who once tried to bind sunlight” is a fresh synthesis of catalog-magic and feral myth; the dream-library peeled inside-out feels inevitable yet unseen. Risky second-person invitation to “breathe the garden as if it were a book” pays off by becoming the literal method of interiorizing exteriors.</comment>
