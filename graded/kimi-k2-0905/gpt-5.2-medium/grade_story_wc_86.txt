<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—trading bodies to “recycle mistakes” yet clutching a handle that once opened a home drawer—grounds every micro-choice. The drawer-pull gift to the scarred boy crystallizes her value hierarchy on the page with visible cost (she relinquishes her sole talisman). Status shifts between Sarin and Vek are legible in gesture and silence, but the boy’s near-silent presence limits relationship crucible pressure. No genuine struggle flaws; competence is balanced by the wire-cutting moment’s physical delicacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brass handle crosses the neutral crack, reweighting the truce from geopolitical abstraction to domestic repair. Causal chain holds—moon-sync rule → full-moon arrival → handle lever → apology whisper → boy walks free—each because/therefore link narrows options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the drawer pull’s absence now denies Lena her private shield, a price legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-wet parapet crack functions as micro-setting that literally guides the exchange step; the brass handle acts as embodied “setting” constraining the wire-removal tactic. Sensory selection stays inside Lena’s negotiator gaze—she notes lantern halos, chain timbre, wire bite—never tourist catalog. Weather (wind, moon) affects timing and bodily exposure, integrating into stakes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across six bodies and one token without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the moon-phase truce intact while salvaging human residue—signals early. One meaningful tightening: the wire-bound wrists force Lena to sacrifice her talisman to prevent bloodshed on neutral stone, foreclosing her private comfort. Cost is visible: she palms empty air as the boy crosses. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the handle’s migration: reparations must be material, intimate, and one-directionally costly. Subtext lives in silence—Sarin’s shaking signature, Vek’s gravel apology—never sermonized. Final image reweights “neutral” from no-man’s-land to a seam that can still carry a gift. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the piece; ambiguity lingers over Lena’s next exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lena’s perceptual signature—brass warmth, moonlit crack, wire squeal—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures during the wire-cut, mirroring risk. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, regionally neutral yet status-coded (Sarin’s mutter vs Vek’s gravel). No filter-verb stacks; psych distance tightens exactly as stakes peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses (mist stitching parapet) to staccato beats (boots scrape, chains chimed). Figurative language is selective: “mist stitched” teaches pattern early and pays off in final hush; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—one sentence often layers weather, body, and political stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: moon-phase hostage timetable fused to a domestic drawer pull as the sole neutral tool—war reduced to kitchen hardware. Premise avoids stock “truce on bridge” by making the neutral line a cracked stone seam no army can hold. Risk taken in quiet climax (whispered apology, gift pass) yet coherence holds. Could not swap handle for coin or key without collapsing the home-repair metaphor.</comment>
