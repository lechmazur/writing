<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s skeptical-professional lens is vivid and consistent; the choice to mail the ledger pages feels earned because the text has shown him weighing risk vs. exposure. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where his debunker identity collides with the temptation to believe—so the arc is more competent than revelatory. Still, the final apple-in-hand gesture gives a tactile, personal cost that lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shredded letters → coordinates → orchard → ledger → broadcast. The Stillpoint reveal re-prices the entire premise (cover relocation, not curse) and the closure beat—mailing pages while biting an irradiated apple—delivers conceptual cost under a Resonant Reconfiguration. One minor slack: the orchard supervisor flips from wary to cooperative too fast, a causality wobble that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Concrete ribs of the city,” “airborne grit circled but never fell,” and the respirator-tinbox pairing give sensory economy that doubles as world-rule exposition. The orchard’s impossible calm is anchored through the protagonist’s body—silence so precise he “could intuit the boundary”—so environment constrains the final step across the threshold. Meets the 9+ gate: the setting’s physics directly shape the tactic of entry and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the Authority’s lie—tightens when the beacon diamond proves the Stillpoint exists. Escalation is one long slope rather than a mid-course reversal, but the orchard ledger forecloses the “maybe it’s all superstition” option with visible cost: once he crosses the dust-free line, he can’t unknow the relocation scam. Enough pressure and price to reach high-band, though a second, harder choice inside the orchard would have pushed it to 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “superstition is state-manufactured camouflage,” seeded by the penny-tasting sky and paid off when the “curse” is revealed as Authority beacon. Subtext lives in gesture: the supervisor’s slap and the worker’s whisper show fear of the very knowledge the regime weaponizes. Final apple bite reweights comfort vs. truth without moralizing—pure image that lets theme resonate. No thematic drift, no echo-statement in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice is lean, sardonic, technically credible—perfect for a debunker. Syntax tightens under pressure (“my hands go cold”) and loosens only once in the supervisor’s clipped dialogue, keeping distance clean. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the one-line whisper “The curse” carries subtext that the narrator refuses to vocalize. Distinctive without showiness, firmly in high-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rows of apple trees, leaves glossy and unburned” does triple duty—image, impossibility, temptation. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; the single participial opener “Standing in a basin” is sequential, not simultaneous, so clarity holds. One micro-drag: “I promised, for my own motivation as much as for her grief” is self-explanatory throat-clearing—cutting it would push this toward 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Flips the standard “cursed artifact” trope into a radiation-homing beacon, then marries it to a pocket-universe orchard used for dissident laundering—synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high: post-apple bite, the narrator is now irradiated and marked, a living leak the Ministry will hunt. Specificity of the flawed diamond’s cut-error and the orchard’s dust-exclusion field anchors the concept in physics rather than hand-wave. Fresh, consequential, publish-now level.</comment>
