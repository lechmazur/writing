<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio’s quiet, ritualized patience is vivid—his “mossy delight,” the smell of rain on his fingers—but the interior contradiction between obedience and rebellion stays summary. The decisive act (opening the vault) is prepared by motif, yet the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied: we are told he “felt a shy mossy delight creep up his ribs,” not shown how that delight collides with terror of the tree falling. Still, the micro-choice chain (sort → prod → build → read → open) tracks cleanly and the final return to trays carries a credible, scaled cost: he must live inside the system he has changed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the公开 reading of the elders’ confession reweights Veyroot’s entire flotation logic from theft to shared memory, with Lio glittering as living evidence of the price. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each monument and prodded leaf adds density until the pattern ruptures the vault. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate drift (who/when never pinned) is taught early and pays off when the ash sky brightens to “pearl gray,” marking the before/after shift. One scaffold lapse: “he emerged transformed always from the shadows” repeats the prompt phrase verbatim and momentarily breaks the lyric skin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arbor is never described in panoramic postcard; instead we inhabit its sorting room, buttress roots, and public walkways through Lio’s tactile labor—seed trays, twig cairns, the seam of a handle-less door. The moon-needle and leaf-ink function as micro-setting: their changing states (bone → milk-pale → glittering dust) constrain every major choice. Weather evolves from “powdered cold ash” to “pearl gray,” mirroring the conceptual shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean; even off-stage geography (drowned Kelmar) is anchored by the cairn pressed against the vault seam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the arbor fall?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the leaf writes DESCEND. Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural logic: each monument adds ballast, each prodded leaf adds textual pressure, until the vault door “sighs open,” foreclosing the elders’ secrecy. Cost is visible in Lio’s moonstone-dusted skin and the public exposure of ancestral theft. One minor slack: the foreman’s refusal is a single beat that does not complicate later tactics; the real opposition is the sealed vault itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory as literal buoyancy—emerges through the seed/book reveal rather than authorial statement. The final image of leaves falling “in gentle clear sentences” reweights every prior cairn from private quirk to civic necessity. Subtext operates in gesture: the elders’ swept compost is their unspoken guilt. No moral is declared; the arbor simply steadies, leaving readers to feel the cost of remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lio’s perceptual signature: time measured in seed ticks, space measured in trays and twigs. Syntax mirrors his ritual patience—long, leaf-veined sentences that slow during the hush, then fracture into single-word leaf commands. The repeated prompt phrase “emerged transformed always” is the only unmotivated register drift; otherwise diction stays inside his lexicon of hulls and rain. The final “mossy delight” modulates from private quirk to public hope without voice slippage.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “leaves fell in patterns like handwriting” compresses world-rule, stakes, and beauty into one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. One mixed metaphor—“the spiral loosened into letters as if embarrassed”—is forgiven because the pathetic fallacy aligns with the tree’s story-hunger. Filter verbs are absent; action is pinned to concrete verbs: scraped, prodded, sighed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating city fed on stolen names is not new, but the mechanic of miniature cairns as counter-ballast and leaf-ink as public confession feels specific and inevitable. The moonstone dust reprises the western bride tale without expositional hand-holding. Risk is taken in the lyric disorientation of time/space, yet it pays off in the final tonal brightening. The synthesis of arboriculture, archive, and civic guilt lands as a singular artistic stance rather than prompt patchwork.</comment>
