<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-soaked interiority is embodied in shaking hands and the salt-jar of ashes; every micro-choice (folding the bird, etching the ring) grows from her contradiction between self-erasure and the need to solder broken days. The final refusal of oblivion is earned because each origami act visibly loosens the “old hunger” while the ring-polishing beat keeps the husband’s absence as living constraint. Only the thin-girl visit feels slightly under-motivated—Lysa’s arrival is convenient, not compelled by Mara’s prior action—so the arc stops just short of flawless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the line “bloom was a craft” reweights every prior pendant-coffin into a forward-facing tool; the cost is the irreversible absence of the husband, still ash in the jar. Causality holds: because Mara releases the first bird, therefore Lysa arrives, therefore Mara re-aims the telescope-curtains, therefore the city starts climbing. One tight accumulative deepening—each new visitor adds a beat rather than a reversal—keeps the lens coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass that never tarnishes and stone floor holding “all winters at once” are not ornamental; the cold starbeam that warms the basil is only possible because the setting stores perpetual winter. The telescope-curtains function as both tool and spatial constraint, forcing Mara to stand inside their fold to bend light. Micro-setting (ring inner band, meteorite filings) constrains the final etching choice. No orientation drift; anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the light from spilling into harm”—is signaled early and tightens through each origami drop: every new visitor narrows Mara’s option to retreat. The single meaningful intensification occurs when the curtains are pulled into a corridor and the starbeam actually sprouts the basil; the price is the public exposure of her private grief-craft. Pressure stays causal under the Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed, only the accrual of desperate climbers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of mourning jewelry into life-seeding instruments; the “genuinely artificial” opal and lab-grown sprout argue that survival is engineered, not found. Final image of “subdued ardor” reconfigures the premise: craft is not consolation but forward propulsion. No moralizing—meaning stays in the basil’s single green point. The refrain of solder/coffin/clasp accumulates without overt symbolic announcement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual bias: constellations “rehearse,” curtains “respond,” starbeam “spills.” Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens into imperative craft beats (“she folded, tucked, etched”). No head-hopping; Sen’s whispered dialogue carries dust-metaphor without ventriloquizing the narrator. Voice modulates from narcotic dusk to forge-low heat without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “every pendant she had ever soldered now felt like a small coffin” fuses backstory, metaphor, and emotional charge in one stroke. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor (salt jar, basil-constellation) is used once and repurposed at closure. Rhythm breathes—long grief-laden cadences contract into tool-action fragments. Zero grammar or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Folding star charts into origami suicide-birds that beckon the desperate uphill is a fresh synthesis of celestial and street-level grief-work. The “curtains of intention” risk gimmick yet earn legitimacy because their fold-pattern is physically manipulated to warm the basil. Mourning-jewelry maker as protagonist is specific, not archetype. Risk taken with lyric ellipsis pays off in the final charged poise.</comment>
