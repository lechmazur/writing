<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass artist’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific—“coaxes light into bottles until it hums”—and her decision to forge proof in glass is earned. Yet the moment she deciphers the smeared ledger line happens off-stage in silent realization, so the decisive micro-choice is only summarized, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: bombing → ledger → canyon reenactment → glass pane → public exposure. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the councilman’s silence and the artist’s new “empty spaces” window—visible to all. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only the single transition into the canyon is marked by white space, acceptable under two-shard default.</comment>

<question>3</question><comment>Frost-tracked hoofprints, kiln-scorched sand, and the glass shard that “caught my lantern like an eye” are tactile and selective. The canyon’s acoustic “drifting resonance” mirrors the protagonist’s listening stance and finally softens once the glass is sealed, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes—expose the charcoal ring or remain silent—tighten when she learns the schoolhouse delivery bears the councilman’s name. The on-page reversal is the choice to trap the evidence in glass rather than march back with the strip, a tactic that raises public risk and personal visibility; cost is legible in the final image of deputies hauling ledgers away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “enduring clarity versus erasure” emerges through glass imagery, frost maps, and the sealed soot numbers; no character moralizes it. The empty spaces left in the new window reconfigure the idea of testimony—absence as evidence—without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a glassblower’s perceptual signature—light, refraction, molten obedience—and rhythmic control (“bright and obedient, into a pane”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction—“lacework maps,” “crystallized final moment”—stays within the artisan’s lexicon and does not clot the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing forensic frost-reading with luminous-glass testimony gives a fresh twist to the “artist uncovers corruption” arc; the glass pane as public indictment feels inevitable yet non-derivative. Risk is present but not structurally radical, keeping it just below the top band.</comment>
