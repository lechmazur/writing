<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—gentle caretaker yet decisive pruner—remains embodied in every micro-choice; the hairpin offering and the choice to assign, not absolve, her brother dramatize a credible shift from seeking contentment to cultivating it, with visible cost. The forgiveness-backstory is kept off-stage, so the “empty space” is asserted rather than dramatized, a minor motivational thinning that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hairpin buried in loam reweights forgiveness into shared duty; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (pruning, dripping pool, scalloped stone) tightens the stake until the final flash of spring shows rebirth is work, not miracle. Causality remains coherent; no orientation debt; cost is legible in the assign-work beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sky vineyard, fig-tree bark, chalky grotto walls, and the hairpin itself act as micro-settings that constrain ascent and tool-use; the fermenting-cloud image and seasonal mirror-pool charge the final reconfiguration. Selective sensory hierarchy (cool weight of hairpin, drip-notes) keeps economy tight while anchoring POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where is contentment?”—tightens when the pool reframes emptiness as furrow; the scalloping action is the one visible beat that narrows options from introspection to cultivation. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; brother’s late entry complicates but does not resolve, preserving cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through cycle-imagery: pruning, rot, new shoots; the final image of planting a young fig where the old burned refuses to moralize, letting the reader feel rebirth as practice. Subtext in silence (greeting brother with assigned saplings, not words) deepens the pardon-into-labor idea without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is vineyard-honed—clouds as “fermenting foam,” bark knots as handholds. Syntax modulates from long lyrical coils to clipped assign-work imperatives, mirroring shift from reverie to duty; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer sentences climb, shorter ones notch into bark. Figurative language is sparse outside the two allowed poetic nodes (cloud-foam, seasonal pool), preventing purple overload. Zero loops, clean grammar, strong verbs (“wedging,” “scallop,” “replant”) propel without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Combining viticulture, aerial grotto, and ancestral hairpin feels fresh; the “forgiveness as shared agricultural duty” twist reframes a familiar sibling-arson plot. Risk lies in the mythic grotto, but grounded viticultural detail and causal integration prevent gimmickry.</comment>
