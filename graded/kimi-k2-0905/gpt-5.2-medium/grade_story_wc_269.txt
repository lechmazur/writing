<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-turned-measurement vocation is concrete and embodied; the atlas page she fingers is a lived object, not a symbol. The final choice—encoding the beacon schedule into tap code—carries visible cost: she surrenders the comfort of open knowledge to protect the reef. Interior contradiction (wanting truth vs. accepting secrecy) stays active in scene. Only minor slip: the hooded woman’s dialogue is slightly expository, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s taped palimpsest and adopted tap code crystallize a new ethic of guided restraint. Causal chain holds: because the reef was scarred, the route is hidden; because Mara learns tapping, she can transmit the hidden schedule. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no debt. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the final image—“drifting moored, holding measurements and secrets.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s glass well, shifting sandbars, and tide-blinked beacons are tactile and plot-functional; the beacons literally constrain when Mara can sail. Sensory hierarchy reflects a data-tech’s gaze—millimeters, slap of water, rust on railing. Fog and tide schedule integrate into the final canal approach, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (aluminum gunwale under tapping knuckles) substitutes for wide geography without white-room risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to Pelican Spur—tightens when the beacons’ timed blink forces a single weekly window; the canal reveal forecloses the old straight path. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the schedule changes knowledge, not firepower. Agency sits with Mara’s decision to encode rather than expose the route. Cost is conceptual—she trades transparency for stewardship—visible in the taped atlas and adopted secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: stewardship sometimes demands selective silence; measurement without intervention can be complicity. Subtext lives in tap code—information passed skin-to-metal rather than broadcast. The reef’s slow freckling of color reweights the atlas page from loss to guarded hope. No moralizing sentence intrudes; the final image of “drifting moored” lets the paradox stand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Mara’s tech-eye: “millimeters,” “GPS tracks,” “station log.” Percussive diction mimics tapping: “slap,” “cut,” “blink,” “drift.” Syntax lengthens under fog, shortens during engine cut—rhythmic control mirrors hazard. Only two spoken lines; both carry subtext (“the old path was allowed to disappear”). No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density: “quiet solar, a floating cube anchored to pilings, drifting in its leash like a patient animal” does world, tech, and mood in one breath. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“patient animal,” “time slices”—never layered to purple. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Proofing clean; only nit is an optional comma after “tide gauge” that would aid rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fossil-free future + hidden tidal canal + tap-code cartography synthesizes into a fresh coastal-cyberpunk pastoral. The timed beacon route is a non-obvious conservation tool; hiding paths from sea-level graphs feels inevitable yet new. Risk taken: quiet eco-spy story without villain or violence—stakes are ethical, not mortal—and it lands. Transformation test fails if transplanted to landlocked setting; salt, tide, and reef are irreplaceable.</comment>
