<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s calm, choice-driven agency is vivid—her decision to call Jonah, to tape the shard, to keep singing—each micro-choice costs her professional detachment and is rooted in her “decisively kind” trait. Elias’s want/need (forgiveness vs. pride) is embodied in the broken vinyl and the cracked breath he times to the warped chorus. The father-son hand-clasp reconfigures their six-year silence with visible cost: Elias’s final exhale, Jonah’s tremor. Interior contradiction is present—Mara’s serenity wavers when she “hears the pulsing stillness”—but the piece stays in lyrical register, not full scene-level interior clash, keeping it just under 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the needle wobbles on the repaired disk, Elias breathes with the scratched hymn, and the stillness after the last note reweights every prior mundane hymn. Causal chain intact—blood-work decline → Mara calls → Jonah walks skybridge → taped shard holds → final exhale. Orientation is immediate (elevator above cloudline) and the single skybridge scene satisfies Track A. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s last breath is timed to the imperfect music, foreclosing any future reconciliation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hymning objects intensifies until the final cadence crystallizes meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rooftop hospice’s citrus-greenhouse air and cloud-reflected light are not backdrop—they become the “scent of hope” that Mara inhales before each action, guiding her to phone Jonah and later thickening at reunion. The broken vinyl shard is handled, flipped, taped, and finally made to play; its physical fragility constrains the closing tactic. Spatial choreography is clean: elevator → corridor → bedside → skybridge → bedside → turntable. Micro-setting (the jagged vinyl edge) literally determines whether the hymn can play and therefore whether goodbye can complete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias execute a flawless goodbye—tightens once: blood-work confirmation removes time, forcing Mara’s call and Jonah’s sky-bridge walk. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices; the shard’s wobble under the needle raises the chance of sonic failure, making the final chorus a gamble. Agency is shared: Mara risks professional distance, Jonah risks reopened grief, Elias risks dying mid-song. Cost is legible—Elias’s last breath arrives exactly as the scratched hymn ends, proving the gamble paid yet the loss still total.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: reconciliation is not repair but shared imperfection—the hymn plays scratched, the record remains cracked, the goodbye succeeds because flaws are admitted, not erased. Subtext lives in objects: the vinyl halves fit but will never spin smooth, imaging relationships. No moral is stated; the final image of warped music and clasped hands reweights “flawless” to mean honest, not perfect. The scent of citrus-green hope returns thickened, a sensory confirmation that acceptance, not resolution, is the only victory available.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s serene, musical perception—she “hears the building’s quiet pulse like a metronome,” thinks in rhythm, sings mundane names. Syntax lengthens and softens under her calm, then fragments slightly (“orange and green”) when emotion peaks, mirroring the wobbling needle. No head-hopping; Jonah’s tremor and Elias’s timed breaths are observed, not interiorized. Voice is distinct, consistent, and purposefully lyrical without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet spare: “jagged as a shard of night,” “breath runs out,” each metaphor serves dual duty (image + emotional state). No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image, action, or stakes. Rhythm modulates—long lullaby clauses contract to “the needle drops it wobbles yet holds” to mimic cardiac falter. One mixed metaphor risk—“aroma…becomes the scent of hope”—but the POV’s synesthetic bias justifies it and the closure image redeems the choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar estrangement: hospice-in-the-sky plus broken-vinyl relic feels fresh, not gimmick; the shard as both keepsake and technological flaw is specific rather than symbolic prop. The “hymning the mundane” method turns a therapy trope into lived ritual that finally times a death. Risk is moderate—lyric compression could have slipped into sentimentality—but restraint at the final exhale keeps it earned. Could edge higher if the mundane hymn list carried one more surprising object, but originality is solid.</comment>
