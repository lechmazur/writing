<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mina’s contradictory impulses—clutch the lost dream vs. release it—are dramatized in the final camera turn; the renunciation costs her the silhouette itself, a price felt on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“palette throbbed like a heartbeat”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to photograph absence rather than presence crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible forfeiture, satisfying the 9+ test even though the beat is compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty photograph reweights the entire premise—longing is answered by letting the dream walk out. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sunrise layer tightens the pattern until the final image breaks it. Cost is legible in the last line—“luminous absence” she must now live inside—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The watercolor palette functions as micro-setting: its pans, light-load, and final floor placement constrain every tactical move. Eastern watchtower, dark docks, and glass-minute sea are filtered through Mina’s professional noticing; the cliff-whisper geography mirrors her internal rumor-mill without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—camera → palette → hanging sheet → door—and the palette’s evolving state (empty / filled / scraped) charges the final image, clearing the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the silhouette is scraped into the palette; the final refusal to hold it forecloses any future capture. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the silhouette’s step-forward forces the choice between memory and future. Cost is visible (she keeps the empty photograph), meeting the 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: capturing light requires releasing the figure. No character states the thesis; the empty photograph reweights prior ciphers without moralizing. The after-effect—reader senses Mina must now inhabit the absence she once fled—lands through image, not assertion, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mina’s perceptual signature—salt-stiff hands, dawn-color skimmed by fingertip—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“sunrise photography, taken at the exact minute…”) then fractures at the climax (“She set… She aimed…”), mirroring her held breath. No register drift; diction remains within a coastal librarian’s lexicon. Patterned elision (no dialogue) is taught early and paid off at closure, meeting the 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world, metaphor, motion—without scaffold: “light she captured and repainted layered into a doorway.” Figurative control peaks in the final beat where metaphor becomes literal threshold; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“luminous absence” repeated in narration and closure) is purposeful reprise, not artifact. Rhythm accelerates into the single-run final sentence, propelling the resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The light-thief librarian who must relinquish her catch fuses photography, memory, and coastal folklore into a premise that feels inevitable yet unseen. Sunrise-as-paintbrush and absence-as-portrait invert familiar grief narratives; the cipher sheets literalize Proustian madeleines without meta-commentary. Risk—ending on an empty photograph—pays off by reconfiguring the entire magic system into emotional law. Transformation is complete: swap any detail and the whole dissolves.</comment>
