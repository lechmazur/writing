<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to recover Senn yet fearing his stolen echo—drives every beat; the childhood-name callback at climax proves the motive was alive throughout. The single micro-choice of singing the counter-phrase costs her a literal note of her own voice, paying the price on the page. Senn and Jaro remain functional extensions rather than full crucibles, capping relationship depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Senn’s shell speaks → Lira follows; because she sings the counter-phrase → luminous threads snap and voices spill. Closure is a decisive change: the paired shell now sings origins, reweighting the world rule that identity can be restored. Cost is legible in the final line—her own throat now carries “reed-blown melancholy” as permanent promise, not transient sorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spiral chamber’s star-silver rocks and luminous sonic threads are not backdrop; they supply the very mechanism the climax cuts. The shell-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical choice: press, join, or break. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footsteps echo back loudly to trap Mael—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Senn’s unmaimed voice—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Mael claims he bargained willingly, forcing Lira to risk losing him again to free him. The single escalation—snapping the luminous threads—carries visible price: the Nexus Choir’s power web collapses and Lira’s own voice is diminished. No reversal is needed; the deepening of knowledge that Senn’s echo carries pain, not pride, is sufficient causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: identity is an audible “I am” that can be stolen or returned, never merely asserted. The final shell now sings “origins,” reconfiguring the moral weight of echo from theft to restoration. No character moralizes; the image of Lira’s reed-blown melancholy turning into promise supplies the resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly pinned to Lira’s perceptual filter—every noticed tremor or thread is what a canyon echo singer would hear. Patterned elision (“songs that never resolved”) is taught early and paid off in the unresolved farewell echo. No head-hopping; even Jaro’s shadow-gestures are observed from her vantage. Syntax mirrors sonic curvature—long vowel-laden clauses that feel like held notes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sonic mythology or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—vehicles stay acoustic (reed, thread, echo) and never mixed with unrelated domains. High information density: “the chamber now returned her footsteps too loudly” simultaneously reveals world rule, poetic justice, and tactical outcome in eleven words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—echo as literal organ of identity that can be harvested and restored—feels inevitable yet unseen. Risky structural choice to hinge climax on a sung counter-phrase rather than physical duel is fully earned by the acoustic world rules taught from line one. Transformation test fails if names or setting are swapped; the specificity of canyon acoustics is irreplaceable.</comment>
