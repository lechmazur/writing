<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable’s refusal-to-coach backstory is cleanly cued by the stone and aligns with his public renunciation; the interior contradiction—yearning for beauty while enforcing restraint—plays out in the pawn-to-crescent beat. Exile is felt cost, but the council vote lands off-stage, muting the final personal price. Still, motive steers every micro-choice without label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: council’s renunciation publicly returns the eclipse and reweights sky–city relations; Sable’s exile-stone on the board supplies visible cost. Causal chain holds: dust response → translated alphabet → public ritual. Single-scene orientation is taught by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Magnetic nexus is not backdrop; dust crescents and compass spins actively constrain interpretation tactics. Twilight light governs visibility of star-map chess pieces, while the stone’s tactile familiarity anchors Sable’s attention under pressure. Selective sensory triage (iron taste, lantern halo) keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prevent false-night by decoding covenant”—is signaled early; pawn-forward test that breaks the dust-crescent provides the single meaningful tightening, proving restraint is required. Council vote costs the city strategic leverage; price is legible. Escalation is quiet but causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “honor celestial cycles rather than weaponize them” emerges through translated refrain and final renunciation, never sermonized. Worry stone’s return as king-substitute reconfigures its meaning from private comfort to public pledge. Ambiguity remains: enemies may still laugh, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays snug to Sable’s perceptual filter—magnetic tug as “tides,” chess grammar as cognition. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, clips tight when dust reacts; no head-hop. Diction favors Latinate precision matching a tutor’s mind without drifting into academic parody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm consciously mirrors magnetic sway—long sentences coil, then snap in short predicate bursts. Figurative layering (“iron dust...secret dance”) is purposeful and paid off when dust literally writes. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“measuring breath in a sickroom”) barely grazes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing geomancy with chess divination feels novel; using a worry stone as the king-piece that seals treaty is an inventive re-casting of the “token of exile.” Premise is high-concept yet executed through tactile minutiae rather than exposition. Risk is moderate—quiet cosmic stakes—but earns freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
