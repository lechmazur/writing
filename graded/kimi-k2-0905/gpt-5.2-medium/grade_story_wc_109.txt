<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cartographer’s “mildly obsessed hunger” is embodied in trembling hands and the theft of the booklet; the final renunciation—mapping silence instead of stars—pays off that trait with visible cost as the gold washes away. Lyr functions less as a full second character than as a prophetic mirror, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin; her choices don’t bend the protagonist’s arc, only authorize it. Interior contradiction is strong: the need to measure vs. the dawning knowledge that measurement is futile plays out in micro-choices (closing the booklet, tracing the spiral). Still, the oracle’s stakes remain opaque, muting the relational torque that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the map is drawn on blank, rain-bleached paper, reweighting the premise—navigation now lives inside the body, not the sky. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt-sweat walls, pebble clatter, dissolving gold) thickens until the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. Orientation is taught early (“storm-tossed ridge fort… its walls sweating salt”) and anchors hold; no penalty applied. The cost is legible in the ruined booklet and the felt hush, but the beat is slightly under-dramatized—an externalized gesture (tearing a page, swallowing a flake) would have sharpened the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the fort’s shell-ridge stones store storms, the parapet bowl turns weather into oracular data, and the dissolving gold leaf becomes a tide-washed reef. Every sensory pick is filtered through the cartographer’s bias—what can be mapped vs. what must be endured—so description never stalls action. The single-star clock tightens the spatial frame, forcing choices under literal vanishing light. Environment constrains the final tactic: only after the sky goes black does the spiral of pebbles become the first landmark, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator possess a usable map once the stars disappear—tightens through accretion: each flake lost from the booklet raises the cost of failure. The midpoint deepening (the map is of “distances between terrors,” not lights) reweights the goal without external antagonism. Agency is exercised by retelling in omissions, a renunciation that forecloses the old cartographic logic. One more beat of bodily risk (a slip on the salt-slick battlement) would have pushed the pressure into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the futility of external orientation when the cosmos migrates inward; no character moralizes, yet the final blank page re-prices every prior attempt at measurement. The ambered hush motif migrates from atmospheric detail to epistemic method, charging the closure without thematic statement. Subtext resides in gesture—pressing fingers to wet paper, scattering pebbles—rather than exposition. The reader is left to calculate the cost of carrying direction inside one’s body, a resonant ambiguity that satisfies the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a lyric-archaic register that never drifts into pastiche; diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) is consistent and motivated by the narrator’s cartographic synesthesia. Perceptual signature is sharp: the POV notices what can or cannot be plotted—silence, pressure, aftertaste—while filtering out conventional emotion. Compression and elision (“I spoke in a slow cadence of omissions”) are taught early and paid off at closure. One syntactic monotony risk: repeated adjective-noun stacks (“storm-tossed ridge fort,” “wind-carved chapel”) but the rhythm modulates under final pressure, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus conceptual reweighting—without scaffold: “the gilding lift and run in threads” simultaneously shows ruin and enacts the theme of erasure. Metaphors are coherent within the maritime-starchart lexicon; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“the way you trace a coast / the way fear tightened”) is minor and does not recur at closure. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“I felt the ambered hush”) they serve immediacy. A single overripe phrase—“ambered hush that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect”—flirts with purple, but the image is earned by prior pattern, so penalty stays modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of starless navigation + cartographic failure + oracular silence feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; the premise could not survive relocation to a generic fantasy fortress. Risk-taking in the “map of silence” concept is high, yet the piece never abandons sensory grounding. No close echoes of familiar SFF scenes; the pebble-bowl divination and gold-leaf erosion are fresh implements. Transformation test passes: swap names or setting and the emotional arc collapses for lack of salt-storm-shell specificity.</comment>
