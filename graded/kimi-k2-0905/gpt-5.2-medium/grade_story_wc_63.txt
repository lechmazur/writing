<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-driven precision and her father-/Torren-haunted memory feel lived-in; the micro-choice to lift the bob, feel corrosion fall, and align the rake-handle scratch shows contradictory duty vs shame in one motion. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation (carrying lead and handle to the widow) costs her the last illusion of quick forgiveness. The only bar to 9 is that the ethical diligence trait is asserted more than tested in a second beat; we see her obey Torren’s map but not a moment where that diligence collides with a live temptation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: fog-wreck → guilt → discovery of secret weight → removal → tide recalibrated; each step narrows options and the final image of the notch meeting the first wave delivers visible cost under Earned Stasis. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the rake-handle cipher is set up early enough to avoid retro-info. Closure lands with the pendulum’s renewed arc and the widow’s single nod—no explanatory dump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, brass bob, and tide marker function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: the ridge kills, the bob’s hidden weight skews time, the recut notch re-syncs moon and clock. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Mara’s professional eye—salt-veined glass, green corrosion, heat rising from dark stone—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless across vertical tower, tidal flats, and ridge; bodies and tools track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring shared balance between sea and town—tightens when Mara realizes the clock was sabotaged; removing the lead forecloses the council’s “efficient” lie and exposes her own complicity. Pressure escalates because each mechanical correction carries social cost: she must confess engineered imbalance to a widow who may never forgive. The final notch-cut is irreversible; the town will now meet real tides, not paper ones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through incremental mechanics: time itself can be lied about, and ethical repair is also incremental, painful, and public. No character states the moral; the final image of the pendulum passing through center again and again silently argues that justice is maintenance, not absolution. Subtext lives in the widow’s single nod—neither forgiveness nor condemnation, only acknowledgment that the lie has been surfaced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—salt-veined glass, brass belly once polished by her father—without poetic overflow. Syntax lengthens under reflection then shortens during the bob removal, mirroring the held breath of the pendulum pause. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her coastal, gear-level lexicon. The only dialogue is the widow’s nod, a perfect indirection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare—“cooled forge,” “surf gnawing”—each image does double duty for setting and emotional state. No scaffolding; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. Lead weight wrapped in cloth and dated on the rake handle is a concrete, propulsive detail that carries into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The notion that a town clock can be secretly weighted to fake tide-time feels fresh, and the rake-handle cipher micro-etched by a disappeared winder is a lovely, specific invention. Incremental absolution rendered through gear teeth and tide notches transforms abstract guilt into tactile penance. Risk is taken with the lyric pause inside the pendulum’s swing, yet it pays off by crystallizing the story’s emotional center.</comment>
