<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caster’s guilt-driven precision and tactile care are embodied in every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between hurry and gentleness is alive in scene. The final act of casting the bronze strip crystallizes a credible renunciation of silence, paying the cost of public exposure. The only minor slack is the Archivist, who functions more as prompt than secondary pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the protagonist’s flaw actively shapes every beat and the closure is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bronze strip reweights the meaning of “mending” from private absolution to communal resonance; cost is legible in the permanent public playback. Causal chain—guilt → invitation → rope decoding → casting—holds without gaps; each beat alters options. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glacier road to the icebound sanctum”). One micro turn (forgiveness already granted, yet world only “thaws”) sets up the final reconfiguration. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice walls, seal-oil lamp, and frost bells are not backdrop; they constrain pace (cold brittleness demands slow re-braiding) and supply the auroral light that literally plays the rope. The punched card scrap and wax tray function as micro-setting objects whose physical properties dictate the final mold. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a metal-worker’s eye—temperature, tensile creak, bronze breath—never tourist catalog. Environment is indispensable to the climax: aurora must be overhead for the harmonics to sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the forgotten names be heard again?”—is signaled early and tightens when the rope’s fragility under cold makes failure tangible. The protagonist’s gentleness versus speed conflict escalates with each strand picked; one wrong creak could erase a name. The final tuck forecloses anonymity: the bells ring, the names become public sound, and the caster’s private guilt is irreversibly socialized. Cost is visible in the sweat-and-wax labor and the aurora’s fading, which confirms the price of permanence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—repair as audible restoration rather than erasure—emerges through the rope-to-bronze transmutation, never sermonized. The final image of children dancing to unheard names reconfigures memory as living motion, not monument. Subtextual tension between silence and resonance is carried by the punched holes themselves: absence becomes legible sound. No tidy moral; the chord “does not accuse,” leaving moral ambiguity intact yet emotionally resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is metallic, methodical, frost-bitten: “my breath sounded like filings in a bell” is a perceptual signature that recurs in wax, bronze, and auroral light. Syntax lengthens during delicate rope-work, then shortens under furnace heat, mirroring thermal stress. No head-hopping; Archivist’s dialogue is sparse, ritual, distinct from caster’s technical idiom. Compression (“snowmelt ardor”) is taught early and pays off in the final warm droplets, keeping lyric elision legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances tool, temperature, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—sound as liquid, light as bell—without mixed collisions. One paraphrase loop (“names I had erased… making a chord”) is forgiven because it is the thematic pivot. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; the final bronze strip lands clean and tactile.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice-bound phonograph made of knotted rope and aurora is a fresh synthesis; memory-as-braid readable by northern lights feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using a craft manual pace inside a lyric flash—heightens stakes rather than gimmickry. The transformation of a harbor scrap into a durable bronze roll collapses centuries into one portable artifact, a non-obvious compression. No derivative echo; the concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
