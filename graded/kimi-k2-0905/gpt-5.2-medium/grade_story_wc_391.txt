<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Irena’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into strategic patience—drives every micro-choice; the vow is embodied in nightly moon-charting and the final refusal to sabotage early. Her embodied emotion (“wolf behind a half-opened door”) is specific, never diagnostic. The cost is legible: she returns alone to redraw the horizon, the grain gone, her earlier sprinting self irretrievably shed. Only the rebels remain slightly generic, preventing the final 0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she once fled projects, she now maps moons; because she maps moons, she times the third-full to dull the coils; because the coils slacken, the clamps are unyoked. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses immediate rebellion for a slower revolution, cost visible in the emptied viaduct and her solitary return. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One transition (dawn after night raid) is clean. Persistent constraint—the viaduct’s magnetic hum—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<comment>Basalt sanctuary, iron filings, and moonlit ice are not backdrop but tool: the cold basalt dulls the copper coils, enabling the heist. Micro-setting of the compass needle’s “angry twitch” under magnetic pull instantiates threat. Weather tracked across nights (thawless sleet, moon angle) alters sled friction and raid timing. Final image—new horizon line—recharges the opening chart, now redrawn by patience rather than sprint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—smuggle grain under empire’s magnetic choke—tightens once: the third-moon window is the only safe moment, foreclosing all earlier impulses. Agency is patient endurance, not battle; cost is the sleepless nights spent charting shadows and the rebels’ deferred violence. No coincidence resolves; the empire’s bridge is neutralized by engineered absence, not luck. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: patience as active sabotage—refusing speed unyokes empire faster than blades. Subtext lives in silence: sleds “slide” without a word, empire finds “absence of obedience,” not wreckage. Final horizon redrawn in solitude reweights earlier sprinting fault into quiet victory. No moral is stated; the grain in reeds is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Irena’s perceptual filter—moonlit ribs of cloud, compass twitch—never ventriloquizing rebels. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during magnetic hum, mirroring her pulse. No head-hop; distant stevedores remain opaque, as they must. Diction—“unyoke,” “moon paths,” “basalt cold enough to dull”—is precise, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long moonlit sentences contract to clipped “then, by her signal.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances tactic or atmosphere. Figurative layer is spare—only “wolf behind a half-opened door” and “angry twitch”—each paid off in action. One mixed metaphor risk—“iron sky meets white water”—reads as horizon line, not muddle, so minimal deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing geomagnetic tech with monastic moon-charting feels fresh; revolution by scheduled grain-roll rather than blood earns risk points. Patience-as-weapon subverts standard sabotage tropes. Rebels’ generic whispered hope is the only template residue, capping originality just below 9.0.</comment>
