<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bram’s contradictory grief-versus-hope impulses stay embodied (trembling pull-cord hand, kneeling to pulp leaves). The final micro-choice—placing the handle on the windowsill—earns its cost through prior tunnel labour and visibly forecloses further nightly ritual, satisfying earned stasis. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, sensory memory (“small giggle…smeared and hollow”) conveys loss. Minor slip: wife and son remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dried-leaf laugh in the apartment reweights the premise, cost felt in Bram’s silent vigil beside the steaming bag. Causal chain holds—because musician’s lore + tunnel trial → pulp → morning laugh—without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“echo chamber tunnel under River Street”). One transition (tunnel → apartment) is clean and necessary. No lens ambiguity; causal logic drives every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tunnel acoustics, fuel stink, and dripping ceiling constrain tactics (must macerate wet leaves to bind sound). The radiator’s warmth in the final shard recharges the earlier “autumn and detergent” mist, crystallizing the before/after. Spatial choreography is tight: three blowers lined, cord tied, pulp bucket tracked. Micro-setting (pull-cord handle as baton) functions as charged object-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the first off-key harmonic fails, forcing Bram to kneel and macerate, trading dignity for possibility. The laugh that ricochets “toward daylight” visibly forecloses the tunnel option, paying a clear price (public exposure of grief ritual). Escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: grief’s unspoken residue can only be composted, not erased. Subtext lives in silence (wife’s errands-only speech, son’s muted cartoons) and in the pulp that literally binds laughter to decay. Final image—son’s unpremeditated snort—offers non-literal answer: catharsis leaks in, unannounced. No moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Bram’s perceptual filter: “fuel stink sharp as memories,” “shapes gather at the edge of his headlamp.” Syntax lengthens during blower crescendo, then fractures into short clauses when engines die, mirroring sonic arc. No head-hopping; wife and son observed only through Bram’s hopeful gaze. Diction remains within municipal-labour lexicon without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “He grinds them into pulp…mixing in the water that drips from the ceiling” advances action, sets smell, and preps lore requirement. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph adds new sensorial or causal layer. One mixed metaphor—“laughter…flees into places built for echoes, and…can hold it like a jar”—is forgiven because the image is later literalized. Rhythm breathes with escalating paragraph lengths until final terse homecoming.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Leaf-blower symphony conductor is fresh yet immediately believable within municipal parade culture. Ritual of composting grief into sonic capture transforms familiar bereavement trope into eco-gothic praxis. Risk—using power-tool noise to birth laughter—pays off without gimmickry because grounded in tactile labour. Specificity of pulp-making and off-key lullaby makes concept inseparable from this story.</comment>
