<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a fragment of grief while yearning to feel time’s texture—are dramatized in the urn-for-truth swap; the cost of timelessness is felt when his pulse vanishes. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final micro-choice (writing the radio tag) crystallizes his new unmeasurable duty. Minor slip: Mara’s motivation remains slightly off-page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the green eyelid-fold reweights the rule-set—time is now transitions, not numbers—and the price is Eli’s unmoored pulse. Causal chain holds: tag invitation → urn trade → timelessness → new duty. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“emerald silo beyond the floodplain”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reconfigures stakes under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The emerald silo’s green iron-and-rain scent constrains every move; the cracked teacup and radio act as micro-settings that gate entry. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral stair, vent chamber, pallet sale outside—and the urn fragment’s tactile weight charges the final sacrifice. One hairline slip: the garage-sale geography is sketched more than walked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what does a second feel like”—tightens when the capsule demands the urn as fare, foreclosing Eli’s countdown. The swap is the single decisive turn that escalates cost from borrowed year to perpetual duty. Pressure stays causal: because he trades grief, he loses measurable pulse. Cost is visible in the sudden stillness of his bloodstream.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: time is the weight of transitions, not digits. The urn-to-radio tag arc reprises grief-as-ballast, reweighted when Eli becomes the keeper of unspoken rhythms. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—green light waiting for the next message—without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitude; meaning stays lodged in sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Eli’s tactile bias; perceptual signature is wind-iron-green. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock (“The humming stopped”). No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is withheld, as Eli can’t read it. Voice modulation under pressure is precise, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“green light folded inward like a closing eyelid.” Information density is high: each line advances stakes, texture, or atmosphere. One minor scaffold: “time capsule slept inside” could trim “slept,” but it doesn’t dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—numerals lose meaning yet grief retains weight—feels inevitable and fresh. Transformation test fails if you swap the urn for any object; ashes-as-ballast is irreplaceable. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final tag. No derivative template; the concept commits fully without retreat.</comment>
