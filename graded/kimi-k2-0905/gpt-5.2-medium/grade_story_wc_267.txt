<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bellhop’s contradictory allegiance to the rule of silence and his need to give Edda a voice is embodied in the micro-choice to whisper “C.” That single syllable costs him a pager alert and crystallizes his stance. Interiority stays concrete—cold metal under the tongue, frost-flag breath—and the final quiet that protects without erasing feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: the missing bolt → secret stair → surveillance truth → decision to speak. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options and ends with the protagonist choosing a new, perilous quiet. Closure lands on-page: the whispered note triggers REMAIN, yet the tightened bench and hidden patient reconfigure safety at visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, ice-muted corridors, and wobbling piano bench are filtered through the bellhop’s hushed attention; every object is touched or adjusted. The bench bolt—handled twice, once as theft and once as fix—literally steadies the climax. Snow, oil-smell, and the humming pipes under the tower constrain action and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice versus survival—tightens when the protagonist learns silence serves surveillance, not safety. The whispered “C” is the decisive escalation that forecloses pure compliance and invites external consequence. Cost is legible: pager vibration, approaching footsteps, shared risk under the piano.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bolt’s journey: safety purchased by enforced silence corrodes humanity. The final image—two people hiding under a now-steady piano—reweights the rule without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: lifting the choir pin, turning the bolt as handle, choosing a quieter disobedience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is hushed, tactile, rhythmically controlled—short clauses mimic breath held against microphones. Diction stays within the bellhop’s lexicon yet finds lyrical compression: “frost-flag of surrender.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail either hides danger or reveals a path.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—white palm of snow, bolt like a star—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, reveal policy, and foreshadow surveillance. No loops or mixed metaphors impair clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The silent-choir premise flips the familiar “oppressive order” trope by making the protagonist its quiet enforcer who sabotages it with a whisper and a hardware fix. The piano bench bolt as both literal stabilizer and metaphorical keystone feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of the thumb-printed stair and oil-scented control room keeps the world from sliding into generic dystopia.</comment>
