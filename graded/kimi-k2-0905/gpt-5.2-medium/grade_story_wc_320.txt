<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and “find the beginning in every ending” motive are concrete from the first paragraph and drive every micro-choice (clamping the fragment, turning the dial, dropping the mast). Interiority stays sensory—smell of ozone, humming bolts—rather than abstract. The only drag is a slight competence aura: she never mis-tunes or doubts, so the final renunciation feels efficient rather than costly. Still, her embodied attention and the sore-hands line keep the arc credibly physical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hush-shard → damped noise → new pulse → dismantle mast → lighter city. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the surrendered mast and the torn-out page—so the lens holds. One hairline slip: “the sky lied” is asserted, not dramatized, but it doesn’t break the linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tower city is tactile—sway, copper smell, moonlit cables—and the gorge’s absence-of-echo after the mast fall reweights the silence. Micro-setting (fragment clamp, feed-line) directly enables the tuning beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices electrical hums, not tourist vistas. Environment constrains the final act—dropping the mast is only possible because the city is already rigged over void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“salvage a pattern before the city is scrapped”—tightens when the silence becomes articulate and demands the mast’s sacrifice. Agency is continuous: each dial turn and bolt loosened narrows options toward the final irreversible act. Cost is visible: physical labor, surrendered mast, discarded notebook page. One tightening suffices; no reversal is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of broadcast → listen; the shard of hush literalizes the idea that silence can be engineered into a new commons. No moral is stated; the final image of villages “learning to answer the sky” reweights all prior transmission imagery. The torn page enacts the theme that records must not trap the future. Subtext resides in gesture—no echo after the fall—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—moonlight “slides,” bolts “hum,” silence is “articulate.” Syntax lengthens under pressure then snaps short for the fall, mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so no voice-drift risk. The occasional lyric uplift (“surrendered spear”) is earned by prior concrete detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence advances image or action. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—mast as spear, hush as water—without mixed vehicles. Final paragraph’s rhythm shift (short clauses, then the long sentence of future listening) gives cadence closure. Minor scaffold: “the city had once broadcast…” is pure exposition, but it’s brief and placed early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a “shard of hush” that must be planted at the base rather than the apex is a fresh inversion of both fantasy MacGuffins and radio-engineering logic. Collapsing Hollywood stardust into gorge-spanning infrastructure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no villain—but the coherence of image and stakes sells it. No close echoes of familiar SFF scenes.</comment>
