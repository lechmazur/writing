<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysa’s quiet stubbornness is concrete—she pockets “trash,” pins buttons, times echoes—each micro-choice embodies her need to give the prophecy back to the workers. Interiority stays specific; no label-speak. The final act of collective release is earned because her patient cataloguing has visibly rewoven relationships (workers close ranks). Cost is felt: the foreman loses control, the warehouse’s future is foreclosed to the owners.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of listening→collecting→shared testimony tightens the stake until the jar’s final release reweights power. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost legible in the foreman’s defeat and the workers’ collective breath. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “as the truth unravels” is repeated phrasing, but it does not touch the final beat.</comment>

<comment>The amber warehouse, cliff mouth, and button-littered floorboards are tactile and selective; proximity to cliff dictates how the echo returns, directly shaping tactics. Buttons evolve from floor-trash to alphabet, charging the closure. Environment constrains: narrow stairs, shelves of silence, canyon acoustics—all used, not backdrop. Micro-setting (scorched button) triggers the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who owns the prophecy and the amber—tightens through each shared memory added to the jar. Escalation is textural: density of voices increases until the foreman tries to seize the jar, crystallizing the power shift. No coincidence; the blackened button’s late emergence is a pattern-break that forces final stance. Cost is visible: owners lose monopoly, workers risk jobs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: collective memory can rewire power. No moralizing; the final “choices” line lets readers feel the reweighting. Subtext lives in gesture—workers closing ranks, foreman’s fear—never explained. The jar’s release reprises earlier motifs (echo, sand, buttons) with new charge, satisfying 9+ resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lysa’s perceptual filter: “silence lay unearthed,” “stubborn things,” “resin-wrapped fear.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with the hourglass rhythm; diction remains within her seamstress lineage. No head-hopping; collective “they” at the end is external observation, not POV breach. Patterned elision (“broken cadence,” “scrambled…clipped”) is taught early and pays off at release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without purple drift. One paraphrase loop: “prophecy was never one voice, but a braid of voices” restates prior line; minor. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph lands cleanly: “air felt lighter” is simple, earned contrast. Read-aloud rhythm modulates effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hourglass + button archive + canyon echo as collective oral-history machine. Tropes (prophecy, worker exploitation) are inverted—the oracle is owned labor, the hero rewrites it into democratic script. Specificity of amber-coated buttons and timed sand prevents generic swap. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure heightens final resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
