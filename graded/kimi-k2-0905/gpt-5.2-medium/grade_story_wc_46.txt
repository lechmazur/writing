<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lio’s guilt-anchored refusal of fire and his micro-choice to breathe apology into the pearl give a credible, embodied arc; the final shared ritual shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“weighed that guilt… palm to palm”) and avoids label-speak. One minor slip: the grown child’s single whispered line is too tidy a mirror, blunting contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s quiet glow reweights the village’s night-life and Lio’s identity, with felt cost (his vow shifts “from punishment into purpose”). Causal chain holds: lantern disaster → fire-ban vow → sea-glass quest → polishing → communal stillness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grotto’s serpentine corridors, tide-pool glass, and salt-fern air are filtered through Lio’s star-watcher gaze; every tactile detail (wet shell grit, beam of brass scale) constrains the polishing action. The misty grotto reappears in the final teaching ritual, charging the ending image. Scale and lantern are reused anchors; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—tightens once when the glass’s silence demands apology and again when the village chooses stillness over flame. Pressure grows accumulatively: each polishing rotation loosens memory and narrows Lio’s options until communal adoption forecloses solitary penance. Cost is legible; no reversal, but deepening suffices for lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-over-flame emerges through grotto hush, pearl craft, and final shared quiet; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in gesture—balancing scale, breathing apology—rather than exposition. The pearl reconfigures festival meaning without sermon, inviting counter-readings (is silence always enough?). Final image reweights prior fire-guilt with calm radiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lio’s perceptual signature: surf heard “as if it were a slow sky,” brass scale as body extension. Syntax lengthens and softens under mist, mirroring his star-watcher patience. No head-hop; diction stays within coastal villager lexicon. One minor cadence slip: “reflectively vibrant” repeats verbatim, dulling sonic texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences carry dual duty (“he weighed that guilt the way he weighed his brass star charts”). No loops or scaffold, strong verbs (“loosened,” “rounded,” “charged”). Figurative layer is restrained; only “night itself had learned to smile” edges sweet but survives at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with polishing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star lore meets tidal craft to solve pyrophobia—trope inversion feels inevitable. Pearl of stillness reimagines festival lantern without gimmickry. Risk lies in quiet ending; payoff succeeds. Some phrasing (“zephyr bloom,” “sealed ink”) flirts with stock lyricism, but specificity of grotto-scale ritual keeps it from generic coast-tale.</comment>
