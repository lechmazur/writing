<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her dread of mutating faces, her tactile re-weaving of light—yet the sister remains a cipher; the portrait’s eyes open, but the emotional cost lands more on concept than on a fully embodied contradiction. The final calm is earned, but the sister’s absence of on-page presence blunts the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lighthouse steadies, the portrait accepts fracture, and the Tower card’s prophecy is paid. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each untangled filament tightens the stake—though the sister’s rescue is reported only through the painted eyes, a slight off-stage dip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The circular library breathing like a ribcage, salt-ink smell rising from the trapdoor, and the lens webbed with knotted light filaments all constrain Mara’s redesign action; the setting is not backdrop but tool. Micro-setting (the loom, the atlas, the damp floor-easel) directly shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fragmented reality is the dominant stake; each untangled knot visibly narrows Mara’s options and raises the cost of fixing a world that won’t stay still. One meaningful tightening—accepting imperfection in the portrait—forecloses the path of repetition and lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the refusal to force unity: fracture becomes the design itself. The final stitched radiance reweights the opening despair without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about which version of the sister is “true,” and the cost is the acceptance of that uncertainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—synesthetic, painterly, slightly fevered. Rhythm modulates from long, mirroring clauses to clipped fragments as the walls groan; no head-hop or register drift. The lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the final “stitched radiance.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image and causality—without scaffold; metaphors (lightning-split Tower = lighthouse) stay coherent. One mixed vehicle: “sea flashed like a cracked mirror” followed by “beam swept as if trying to stitch” creates momentary mirror/needle dissonance, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Portrait artist re-stitches reality by untangling light inside a sentient lighthouse-library” is a fresh synthesis; the tarot-Tower/lighthouse isomorphism feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal showdown—heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
