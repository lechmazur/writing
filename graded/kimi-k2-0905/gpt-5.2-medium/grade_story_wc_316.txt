<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s post-ego-death clarity is viscerally embodied in the breath-sync with the jarred brain; the final co-guardianship renunciation costs him his claim to singular identity, a price legible in the cracked numbness. Interior contradiction pulses throughout—he both wields clarity and feels hollow—driving every micro-choice. The clone body’s shudder under shared attention, not implanted mind, crystallizes the thematic personhood without tidy redemption. Only the Custodians and Council remain symbolic ciphers, blunting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new charter rewrites legal identity into mutual custody, felt cost etched in the narrator’s cracked emotional drum. Causal chain holds—because he vivifies opposites, the jarred brain is not transplanted yet the clone breathes, therefore the factions must accept co-guardianship. Orientation is taught early via drifting constellations and gravity-ropes, waived at payoff. One minor loop: “custody battle” is named twice in adjacent clauses, but it never touches the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating rock’s braided gravity ropes and two-toned wind bells constrain stance and breath, directly shaping the push-pull technique used to force factions into shared respiration. The jar—micro-setting—charges the final image when palm on glass synchronizes pulses, reweighting personhood. Ash-colored sea and shifting constellations evoke history’s instability without cataloguing. Spatial choreography stays clean across the mat’s edge and cloud void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who owns continuity—tightens when the jarred brain’s legal claim threatens to overwrite the living fighter. Escalation is causal: because the narrator refuses dominance, he must vivify opposites, narrowing options to co-guardianship. The shared-breath trial forecloses sole identity, price visible in his emptied chest. Custodians and Council remain off-stage pressures, slightly muting visceral opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as negotiated attention rather than origination. The jarred brain’s reprise under shared breath reweights “original” into co-custodian without moralizing. Numbness cracks through communal respiration, not victory—an earned, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: both versions remain rewrites, refusing tidy symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is distinct: “clarity that sliced through pretense the way a blade parts fog”—a precise, character-specific metaphor. Rhythm modulates from long reflective arcs to staccato trial breaths, mirroring emotional pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress. Occasional elevated diction (“vivify,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within the narrator’s post-ego lexicon.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I opened the jar and placed my palm on the glass, letting my breath slow until I could feel both our pulses” advances plot, theme, and sensation in one line. No loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors are absent. Strong verbs—“sliced,” “shuddered,” “watered”—replace modifiers. One minor paraphrase: “neither of us was an original, we were both rewrites” could trim second clause, but it occurs before the final third, leaving closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody trial on a gravity-roped dojo reframes identity as shared breath—fresh synthesis of legal SF and martial arts philosophy. Risk: history rewrites hourly, yet the rule is taught early and paid off when the narrator rewrites custody itself. Specific detail—two-toned wind bells, ash sea—prevents generic anywhere. The ending’s co-guardianship feels inevitable yet non-obvious, reconfiguring prior motifs.</comment>
