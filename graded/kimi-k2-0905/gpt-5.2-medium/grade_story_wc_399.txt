<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iri’s peripheral awareness, masked honesty, and balancing vocation are concrete and embodied; her micro-choice to offer the dawn ritual and her shared tear with the prophet crystallize a credible renunciation of ownership over wisdom. Interior contradiction is present but stays slightly cerebral—no visceral flaw that risks failure. The final quiet accord lands as earned stasis with visible cost: she accepts perpetual secrecy. Still, the prophet’s motivation is sketched more than dramatized, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the widening sonic stair collapses into “steadier sleep,” Iri accepts guardianship, and the cost—shared vulnerability and lifelong silence—is legible in the final whisperfield calm. Causal chain holds: prophet’s arrival → parapet twitch → ritual bargain → stabilized wall. Orientation is swift; place, time, and stakes are anchored within the first 100 words. One minor slack: the elders’ fear is asserted, not tested, so the tightening is more textural than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Desert dunes, rope walkway, and breathing linen pavilion are filtered through Iri’s tightrope attention; the kinetic parapet itself acts as micro-setting that physically shifts underfoot, constraining every balance decision. Sensory hierarchy favors wind, grinding sand, and steam over visual catalog. The final “thin stair of sound” reuses the setting’s buried architecture to charge the closing image. Spatial choreography across the dawn ritual is crystal-clear; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve echo versus let it be co-opted—surfaces early and tightens when noon twitches signal risk. The dawn ritual constitutes one meaningful escalation: shared breath and named doubts literally set stones true, widening the clearing; failure would silence or weaponize the sages’ hum. Cost is felt: prophet’s tear, Iri’s embrace of secrecy. No second reversal, but under an accumulative lens the single deepening is sufficient; however, external jeopardy stays abstract, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—custodianship without possession—emerges through salt taps, heel rhythms, and the final refusal to grab the hum. Subtext lives in silence, peripheral sight, and the prophet’s tremoring fingers. The closing image of “right kind of secrecy” offers a charged, non-moral answer. No thematic slogans; wisdom stays implicit, though the elders’ off-stage anxiety is slightly thematic tell.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Iri’s shoulder with perceptual signature: peripheral vision, rope tension, mask-framed honesty. Syntax is lean, rhythmic, with controlled repetition (“conjured clearing,” “whisperfield calm”) that teaches its pattern early. No head-hopping; prophet’s interior is inferred only through gesture, maintaining distance. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “kinetic parapet”) fits the mythic register without drifting into committee voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences multitask, advancing atmosphere while guiding action. Metaphors (“parapet... like ribs under skin”) cohere and do not pile up within high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop—“clearing could be called... a clearing of quiet”—is a hairline slack. Otherwise no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, and the final paragraph lands with crystalline brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Mythic desert oracles are familiar, yet the kinetic parapet that stabilizes only under balanced disregard, and the consecration via naming one’s doubts, feel freshly synthesized. The peripheral-awareness mechanic and rope-walking priestess create a singular visual-ritual logic. Risk is taken: climax is a shared breath pattern, not a battle, yet stakes remain legible. Specificity of salt taps, heel code, and echo-hum transforms trope into memorable invention.</comment>
