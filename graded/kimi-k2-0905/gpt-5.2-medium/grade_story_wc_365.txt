<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker POV is vivid and embodied—palms reading oil, tongue tasting coolant—yet the withheld-truth guilt is told more than dramatized until the final log entry. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the brother’s single line of accusation has to carry the entire emotional turn. Still, the micro-choice to amend the log is earned and costs the narrator the last of their cyclic safety, giving the arc credible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each seam-jump is motivated by the need to correct the lie, narrowing options until the log amendment locks the truth in place. Orientation is swift—cold deckplates, Dock Seven, green shard—within the first 60 words. Closure is a decisive change: the truth’s weight shifts from private rib-crushing burden to shared public record, cost legible in Jalen’s freed yet scarred presence and the narrator’s loss of cycle-control.</comment>

<comment>The bay is tactile—grit, oil smears, coolant scent—each detail filtered through the mapper’s professional bias and used to steer movement. The shard-as-micro-setting literally refracts the seam that opens the hatch; the bay’s broken hull plates become the pivot point for the final log entry. Spatial choreography is clean across universes; no floating objects or drifted anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—lifting the lie’s weight—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the beacon taps out Jalen’s call sign. One meaningful reversal: the hatch sealed → open via shard-refraction, forcing confrontation. Cost is visible: brother bound in wire, narrator’s cyclic passport revoked once the truth is logged. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring image of weight—ribs, anchor, cargo—culminating in the conceptual repricing that truth is ballast for entire worlds. No moralizing line; the final image of shared weight landing on both siblings reconfigures the premise without sermon. Subtext of familial betrayal is carried in the single line “you cut my anchor,” letting silence do the rest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is dense, synesthetic, and consistent—diction of “static taste,” “seam like overlapped film”—without purple overload. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under jump-stress, then short declarative log entry. No head-hopping; unreliability is seeded early (“I thought a lie would keep Jalen safe”) and paid off when the log is amended.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often maps temperature, scent, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective—green shard as “dangerous sail”—and never clutters the climactic seam-cut. One paraphrase loop (“weight… heavier than any cargo” echoed two sentences later) but it lands outside the closure beat. Final line is crisp, image-driven, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The parallel-universe weave is familiar SF furniture, but the sensory-mapper profession and the shard-as-prism refraction give it a fresh tactile slant. Cyclic spontaneous travel is not explained yet feels rule-bound through the shard’s heat and seam geometry. Risk is taken with lyric compression and pays off: the concept reweights truth as literal ballast, an inflection that would collapse if swapped for generic teleport.</comment>
