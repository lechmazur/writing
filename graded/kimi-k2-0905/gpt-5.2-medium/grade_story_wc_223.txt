<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Survivor-guilt historian is vivid; embodied micro-choices (ripping bundles, staged sobs) show contradictory impulses under pressure. Final renunciation—losing archive originals to save testimony—carries felt cost tied to sworn vow. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk; instead gesture-logic drives every beat. A hairline slip: “benevolently ruthless” is named once rather than dramatized as inner friction, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: pawn-less board on gallery ledge crystallizes new historian-stance with undeniable conceptual cost—testimony freed, crowns still exposed. Causal chain—message → gait-cipher → archive breach → sacrifice—tightens options under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat reweights what “record” means. Persistent constraint (no pawns = guardianship of the small) shapes tactics from bridge memory to final image. Cost is legible in the single line “I left nothing for the loyalists to burn,” foreclosing future safety.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whispering-gallery acoustics and pawn-less chessboard function as micro-settings that actively constrain stealth tactics and symbolize exposed power. Selective sensory pins—cold paper smell, skate of whispers—filter through survivor-hypervigilant POV rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across one continuous scene; heel-clicks travel believably. Environment never merely backdrop; echo physics enables the UNBIND cipher to work, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save “small gestures” from erasure—tightens when loyalists plan rewrite. Mid-scene deepening: messenger’s vellum forces trade-off between personal safety and archival truth, visible price set at imprisonment. Escalation accumulates via density: each ripped bundle increases jeopardy while narrowing options to single satchel. Final broad-sheet fallout shows stakes reverberated beyond cell, fulfilling archival insistence with city-scale consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of luminous absence emerges through iterated images—missing handprint, empty pawn rank, vanished prince—without once naming the theme aloud. Subtext in gesture-code (finger tap, sleeve tug) lets silence carry political weight. Final reconfiguration: testimony released into public reweights meaning of “empty” from loss to liberated space. No moralizing; resonance lingers in after-image of chessboard that now records by emptiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person perceptual signature—echo-location, inventory of small surviving motions—remains consistent and rhythmically controlled. Lyric compression (“absence can glow”) is taught early and paid off in closure image. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable within single-scene window. Filter verbs (“I listened”) appear sparingly and voice-motivated, maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent within gallery acoustics and chess logic; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each sentence advances tension or atmosphere. Only minor scaffold: “bundles of testimony tied with red cord” could lose “of testimony,” but artifact does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: interregnum power-vacancy told through micro-gesture historiography and acoustic cryptography. Walking cipher repurposes childhood market trick into revolutionary code, transforming familiar palace-intrigue frame. Risk in abstract stakes (“small gestures”) is grounded via tactile archive raid. Not quite 9+ because premise still nests within coup-archive rescue template, albeit re-skinned with sensory precision.</comment>
