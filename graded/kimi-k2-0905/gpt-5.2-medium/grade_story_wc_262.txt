<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory hunger to steal light yet retrieve lost love is embodied in micro-choices—warming the can, threading blank film—so her final reading into white light costs her the privacy of her own unsent letters. Interiority stays specific: “spatially imaginative since childhood” maps the booth as a universe, not a label. The earned renunciation—labeling the can “deliver” and walking out—carries visible cost because the lyric loop finally quiets, proving the ritual completed. Flaw: we never feel her body under stress; the booth remains a mind-map more than a crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty rectangle of light becomes an envelope that re-weights all prior blankness as a vessel for love. Accumulative lens holds—each handled object (ticket stubs, rewound leader) thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift lands with felt cost: “the lyrics in her head finally rested.” Causality is lyric but coherent: because she projects nothing and speaks her letters into it, therefore the unfinished ritual completes and forecloses her private loop. Minor slip: orientation anchor “up in its vintage movie palace projection booth” arrives late (word 26), but the lyrical disorientation serves the final image, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The booth’s velvet rain, grease-pencil smell, and rewinder table underfoot constrain every move; the projector lamp literally incubates the film, charging the climax. Micro-setting mastery: “love tucked behind the beam path, regret pooling under the rewind table” turns air into topography Mara must navigate. Weather folds into interiority—“storm had softened” mirrors the hush when lyrics settle—without overt symbolism. Only hairline slip: we get no sensory trace of Mara’s own body temperature against the cold can, a missed tactile beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each archival object: ticket stubs, blank leader, torn letters. One meaningful deepening: blank frames convert from absence to container, narrowing Mara’s options to speak aloud into light or forever carry the loop. Cost is legible: the instant she vocalizes her letters, the private earworm dies, a loss foreshadowed by “hoping the tearing would teach the words to sing.” Accumulative escalation holds; no causal reversals are needed because the pattern break (projecting nothing) reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: unfinished goodbyes archived in obsolete media wait for a reader willing to finish them. Subtext operates in gesture—Eli’s grease-pencil stains, Mara’s finger on cold leader—never in commentary. Final image of thunder “that has learned to whisper” offers non-literal answer: love isn’t stored in hearts but in the silence after speech. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration; the blank film’s repricing carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—velvet rain, corridors of air—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors spatial mind: long clause layering “coordinates” followed by staccato “She threaded the strip anyway.” Compression taught early (“rain sounded like someone folding velvet”) pays off in final whispered thunder. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction stays within Mara’s mystic-trade lexicon yet avoids purple drift. Rhythm modulates: looping sentences mimic earworm, then cut short when lyrics settle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet musical: “pressure, and the strip pressed back” doubles noun/verb without redundancy. Figurative control: metaphors of burglary, incubation, and thunder remain coherent under projection-booth physics. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Micro-flaw: “as though forgotten lyrics search for tune inside her skull” leans simile where prior clauses owned the image, a hairline slack in peak beat. Otherwise propulsion is flawless to the whispered end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses psychometry with obsolete film tech to ask a fresh question: where does unspent affection archive itself? Transformation of blank leader from void to vessel feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—projecting nothing as climax—pays off conceptually without gimmick. Specificity anchors novelty: grease-pencil stains, sprocket clatter, ticket-stub letters keep the conceit grounded. No close echoes; the lyric cadence is original.</comment>
