<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s porous grief is embodied in the way he bows to meteor charts and warms the lantern glass; the final invitation to the technicians shows a credible shift from isolation to shared vulnerability. Interiority stays concrete (“breath animal and measured”) and avoids label-speak. The brother’s death is the single reflective block that tilts his present stance, meeting BRR. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when he decides to trace meteors “not for calibration but to empathize,” foreclosing the path of silent mourning. Cost is felt in the soft laughter amid fragments—an earned stasis that accepts ongoing breakage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the density of meteor arcs, lantern glow, and shared silence tightens until the final collective trace reweights grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—the converging green streaks point back at the station, crystallizing the option to stand together inside fracture. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“basalt ridge,” “night,” “Lio”). No causality break; the tunnel discovery is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Cost is legible in the image of “brief fragments” they laugh at, accepting impermanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station’s creaking bones, yellow glass warming a palm, and meteor ticks against vellum constrain every choice; the lantern glass literally filters the final shared act. Micro-setting (body + tool) qualifies and charges the last image. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold corridors, ticking generators—mirrors internal hush without cataloging. Spatial choreography holds from dome to collapsed tunnel; no floating rooms. Environment forecloses the option to stay sealed off, forcing the tunnel discovery that reframes the station as vessel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Lio remain porous without being shattered? Pressure escalates as meteor tracks converge on the station, tightening the choice to keep tracing alone or invite others. The green low-flare meteor is the single deepening that reweights options. Cost is visible in the soft laughter—acceptance of ongoing loss. No antagonist needed; grief and sky supply coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular act of tracing falling lines to practice release; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in the lantern glass warming the palm—light needs a crack to enter. Final reconfiguration: vulnerability becomes nourishment, not failure. Avoids sentimental closure; the world is not fixed, only inhabited differently. The director’s logbook reframes the station’s history without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lio’s perceptual signature: “flourishing stillness,” “spiritually curious enough to bow.” Syntax lengthens during meteor calm, shortens during green flare. No head-hopping; technicians’ softening is observed externally. Lantern glass recurs with shifting emotional charge. Filter verbs serve voice (“he suspected each streak was a traveler”). No register drift; diction remains within Lio’s quiet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“slow-moving embers,” “ticking like bones”—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interiority + foreshadowing. Final line lands on image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic janitor who cleans lenses to keep grief transparent. Meteor-tracing as grief ritual feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Yellow lantern glass repurposes runway shard into contemplative tool. Risk taken in quiet accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the arc.</comment>
