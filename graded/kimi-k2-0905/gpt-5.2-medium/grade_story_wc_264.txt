<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard’s contradiction—dreamless yet tending “sparks”—is dramatized through micro-choices (nudging the switch, planting ember-seeds) that cost him dispersal across timelines. The final stance of permanent, multiversal vigilance is earned by the prior split and carries clear, scaling cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak even at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist holds midnight open, paying with eternal partiality across histories—cost is legible in “constant care, like keeping a coal alive in a tin.” Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via iterative “occasionally everywhere” refrains and held to final image. Orientation anchored by mile-marker Zero within 120 words; no causality breaks. One clean transition into ledger-dune walk; auditors’ arrival supplies the single tightening beat required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glowing dune’s photon grains and ledger-shelves constrain every tactic (switch-points, seed-planting) and charge the final “bloom” image. Sensory triangulation (light, ash-smell, rail-rhythm) is filtered through the guard’s professional attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across real/quantum shelves. One recurring object—the chess clock—functions as micro-setting that gates choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep possibility alive versus corporate collapse—signaled in first third. Escalation follows Accumulative pattern: each seeded spark increases density until auditors arrive, forcing a stance crystallization. Protagonist’s dispersal is the visible price. No coincidence resolves; the wave-function charm merely repels, leaving threat latent—sufficient tightening for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodial choice under multiversal entropy emerges through iterated sparks-seeds-wicks, never slogan. Final “midnight held open” reweights the frozen clock without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: bloom may still fail, yet refusal feels charged. No echoic thesis statements; meaning arises from material action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a freight-hand’s tactile idiom fused with quantum lullaby cadence—distinct, consistent, pressure-responsive. Patterned elision (“occasionally everywhere”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets waived. Psychic distance tightens credibly under split-existence stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, world-rule, or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long rail-thunder lines to clipped seed-planting fragments. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; figurative language is sparse enough to stay precise. Final third remains clean—no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Collapses cli-fi, quantum-archive SF, and railroad noir into a singular lyric stance. The “divergent archive” trope is reanimated through sensory freight-hand labor rather than abstraction. Risk of lyric diffusion is balanced by concrete seed-planting payoff. Transformation test fails if names change—details are irreplaceably welded to voice.</comment>
