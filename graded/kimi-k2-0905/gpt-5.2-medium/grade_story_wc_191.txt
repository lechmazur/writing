<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ione’s “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized in the micro-choice to drive into the waterfall and later to refuse the crown; the interior contradiction between custodial caution and hunger for the edge is kept alive in scene. The final renunciation carries visible cost—she exits with no crown, only a story—earning Earned Stasis. One slip: the emotional register at the throne interface drifts toward abstract self-explanation (“never been about owning”), slightly blunting the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ruby flake → orchard → descending stair → interface → refusal, each link forced by prior choice. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne’s meaning flips from sovereignty to shared witness, cost legible in the empty seat she leaves behind. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The single beat of escalation is sufficient under short-form default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Ione’s curator gaze—ozone, cassette hiss, bioluminescent leaf-veins—each detail selected for sensory economy. The peeling pavilion paint becomes a literal archive that constrains her next move, qualifying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean across the waterfall transition; the orchard’s geometry guides her to the gate. Only the city’s “neon reflections” verge on postcard shorthand, but the moment passes quickly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the stairway before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightened by the literal clock; the sunrise deadline forces the final descent and exit. Ascension reinterpreted as descent is a meaningful reversal that narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits personal rule to keep the archive intact. No secondary pressure from antagonist, but short-form default allows single-track escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as civic succession trumps monarchy. The ruby flake’s final socketing reframes sovereignty from solitary crown to collective mural, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier images without moralizing. Subtext resides in the unspoken fear that the city would stream her witness to a cloud she distrusts. Final image of heirless story avoids tidy thesis yet lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Ione’s perceptual signature—mechanical clicks, mineral code, orchard lantern memory—syntax tightening under waterfall pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts cleanly during the descent. One clause (“almost childish in its hope”) edges toward diagnostic self-label but is immediately grounded in the satchel slap and skiff launch. Voice remains distinct and coherent at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose shows rhythmic variety and high density: “ruby flake bled a red sheen that made the older pigments flare” does triple sensory job. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (waterfall as radio static). One near-miss: “city receded in neon reflections” is generic, but it occupies a transitional beat, not the closure. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: analog archive + bioluminescent orchard + inverted stairway reframes “ascension” as communal memory rather than elevation. Ruby flake as data key rather than jewel avoids stock MacGuffin. Risk in refusing the crown is fully committed to, not hedged. The piece could only exist in this confluence of details; swap any layer and the logic collapses.</comment>
