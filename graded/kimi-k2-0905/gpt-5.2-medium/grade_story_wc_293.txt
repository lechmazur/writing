<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fiddler’s interiority is vivid—ashes of “never,” the bow-arm curve in the pixelated self-portrait—but the sister-fire motive is told once and never re-engaged under pressure; the final choice feels symbolically right rather than personally inevitable. Micro-choices (using the flake as shim, exposing the plate) are present and embodied, yet the emotional cost is inferred more than dramatized. Still, the contradiction between clinging to story and surrendering to erasure is legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mosaic pattern (four shards) is taught by the 25% mark and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pixelated self-portrait reweights identity from legal name to mutable tune. Causal chain holds—flake→numbers→scaffold→camera→self-exposure—each step foreclosing the last. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the fiddler accepts becoming “only a tune” to escape the fire-ash identity. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Bridge, scaffold wrap, and pullout are sketched with selective sensory detail (white plastic snapping like a flag refusing a country) and constrain movement: the wrap hides the arrow, the pullout box demands the flake as key. Micro-setting (glass flake edge, collodion syrup) doubles as tool and tactile world. Weather (gust that erases the hitchhiker) charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—legal erasure vs. remembered self—surfaces early and tightens when the fiddler must choose to pixelate their own face. One meaningful deepening: realizing the program is “illegal and tender” raises personal risk. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is conceptual but legible: the old name is forfeited to the server.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of negotiated erasure emerges through image and action: ashes → pixels → amnesty. Subtext lives in the bow-arm curve surviving pixelation—art persists where identity dissolves. No moralizing; the ending image of playing “for strangers” lets resonance linger. The ethical ambiguity (erasure as mercy) is held, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: sound timed to footsteps, tires that hiss, images broken into squares of mercy. Syntax mirrors fiddle phrasing—long slides, abrupt stops—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice must carry all; it does. Compression (“moonlit syrup”) is patterned early and paid off in the pour beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies like bow strokes; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but each vehicle advances stakes (pixelated amnesty, scaffold flag). One mixed metaphor—“legal and tender” jars slightly but reads as character idiom. Information density strong; every sentence advances image or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing wet-plate collodion, illegal name-servers, and bridge-song into a coherent smuggler’s ritual feels fresh and inevitable. Pixelated amnesty reframes surveillance tropes through artisanal photography. Risk taken with mosaic shard structure pays off in thematic reconfiguration. Specificity of process (pouring collodion under a mountain pullout) anchors the concept.</comment>
