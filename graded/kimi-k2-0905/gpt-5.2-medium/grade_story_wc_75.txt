<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris’s bread-custom and lens-use give concrete, character-specific action; her dread is palpable. Yet interiority sometimes drifts into curatorial labels (“sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour”) that feel authored, not lived. The final offer of the captain’s initial loaf crystallizes her values, but the beat is narrated rather than embodied in gesture or dialogue. Still, her choices drive every turn, cost is felt, and contradiction (hope vs. evacuation dread) stays active.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the museum becomes opera house, guards retreat, art stays breathing—cost is the perpetual threat now internalized. Causal chain holds: honey loaves → thaw → spectacle → moral pause. Orientation is swift; grotto, waterfall, alcoves anchored by word 80. One soft spot: the Council’s reversal hinges on a single captain’s hesitation—slightly convenient, but the loaf-offer is foreshadowed and the lens has already framed history as hostage, so the stakes stay earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Waterfall mist, kiln heat, and rosewater steam interleave to create a living climate that directly enables the thaw tactic. The emerald lens acts as micro-setting: its green circle literally refracts what power wants to sell, guiding Maris’s clandestine moves. Spatial choreography is clean—ice door, alcoves, stage left, exit tunnels—bodies move without ghosting. Only the beekeeper’s absence is asserted, not sensed, a minor blank.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the art from Council seizure—signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens through each loaf, each drop of thaw, each note revealed; options narrow to “perform or lose.” The captain’s refusal to trample bread is the single reversal that forecloses eviction; it is earned because Maris has weaponized museum craft into communal ritual. Cost is legible: perpetual dread remains, guards may return, but for now breath is bought with vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as edible, singable resistance—emerges from honeyed initials and frozen scores, never sermonized. The final image of guards leaving “with boots damp” quietly reweights mercy as civic tradition. Subtext flourishes in silence: refugees eating their own letters ingest identity faster than any permit could grant. Complexity acknowledged—art survives yet remains hostage to future raids—avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maris’s curator eye: mildew = goldleaf, crust = varnish, dates = talismans. Syntax flexes from fluid curatorial cadence to staccato thaw-drops “tapping like a metronome,” mirroring rising urgency. No head-hopping; even the captain’s hesitation is externalized through Maris’s offer and the narrator’s report of “hesitation,” not internal monologue. Distinctive, consistent, pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rosewater from the crust rose with the cold mist” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, tactic, or temperature. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ice door, varnish crust). Minor elevated diction (“provenance,” “scrims”) fits museum-guide POV and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing refugee crisis with opera-house preservation inside a waterfall grotto feels fresh, not grafted. The bread-initial registry turns a sentimental folk custom into urgent census and resistance tool—specific, memorable. Risk is high: singing children could read as sentimental, but the prior dread and moldy scores ground the moment in decay. Transformation complete: without these exact elements the eviction shelter cannot become stage.</comment>
