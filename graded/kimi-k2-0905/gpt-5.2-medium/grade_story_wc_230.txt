<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s involuntary-truth tic is embodied every time she speaks; the glass-eye test shows a credible micro-choice that alters her risk. The final burial of the relic is an earned renunciation that costs her future ease, visible on the page. Interiority stays concrete—”truth is a kind of shrapnel”—and avoids label-speak. Status play with Lio and the captain is legible and forces tactical silence, satisfying relationship-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mara cannot lie, therefore the eye becomes tactical, therefore she can mislead the patrol and must hide the evidence. Closure is a Decisive Change—she buries the eye, trading personal safety for communal safety; cost is felt in the final sentence. Orientation is anchored by word 80 with “hanging orchard that clings to a ravine.” No teleporting props; the hollow casing is planted and the real eye buried in causal order.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The swaying cable-trees, boxed roots, and black-truffle bed are tactile and filter through Mara’s forager gaze. Weather—static-charged storms—directly alters goat behavior and forces the eye-clinic solution. The glass eye itself functions as micro-setting that constrains her speech in the final confrontation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the shed, table, and burial spot beneath the truffles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting the orchard’s psychological safety—tightens when the patrol arrives. One meaningful escalation: the eye shifts from curiosity to shield, narrowing Mara’s options to deceit-by-silence or exposure. Cost is visible: she sacrifices the relic and her own future ease. No coincidence resolves the threat; the planted casing is a deliberate tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that honesty must be weaponized to protect fragility. The glass eye’s reprise—first lens, then buried secret—reweights “truth” as something that can be chosen, not erased. Final image of secrecy-as-grace offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Subtext in the captain’s “smiled too warmly” carries the real menace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct: truffle-ledger metaphors, “rational truffle forager,” and storm-static on goats create a singular perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences in calm, staccato beats under patrol pressure. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Mara-bound. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Lio’s confession, the captain’s warm smile, each advances the tactical line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—”truth is shrapnel,” “orchard remembers falling”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Strong verbs (“snapped a pear platform loose,” “slipped the hollow casing”) propel momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus frame and truth-compulsion feel fresh, yet the story’s heart is an intimate ethics-of-care dilemma. Glass eye as lie-blocker reverses the usual relic trope into a tool of selective silence. Specificity—truffle mycorrhiza, boxed roots, onion-smuggling—grounds the concept in lived detail. Final burial reconfigures “grace” as secrecy, a non-obvious moral inversion that lingers.</comment>
