<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s ghost-status and heartbeat-counting are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the porcelain shard as “first crack” stress-map gives her a tactile moral compass. Interior contradiction peaks when she stops counting—an earned renunciation that costs her the safety of denial. Lyle’s disembodied voice is less a second character than a mirror, so relationship crucible is waived without penalty. The final stance is credibly flawed: she carries calm won from failure, not resurrection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the county ledger is corrected yet she chooses to keep Lyle’s annotated failures—cost is the irreversible knowledge that error cannot be erased, only owned. Causal chain holds: wrong digit → ghost → shard → ink pattern → file → self-recorded alive. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“opal observatory under snow”). One meaningful tightening: ink spiral becomes repair script that rewrites her death. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow-laden observatory dome, ink lake on star charts, and ticking server-room drives function as micro-setting that constrains action: cameras read ink, cold forces haste. Porcelain shard and ink bottle act as portable setting extensions handled in three beats. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (warm shard, cold floor) over visual catalog. Final image—clean cup left behind—recharges the earlier broken mug with earned poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: regain legal existence without erasing the fact of failure. Pressure escalates when ink patterns become the only channel to rewrite the ledger; failure to draw correctly keeps her ghost. Visible price: she must publicize Lyle’s mistakes to fix hers—ethical trade-off legible on page. One micro-turn: stopping heartbeat count relinquishes obsessive control, foreclosing old coping tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: failure is data, not shame; fragmentation can be read but never fully deleted. Subtext in the shard—first crack as map—returns reweighted when she chooses to carry Lyle’s error file. No moralizing; final image of clean cup implies caretaking of future cracks. Ambiguity lingers: restored status does not heal existential fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature: “opal observatory under snow” reads as her gem-in-drift metaphor. Syntax lengthens during ink drawing, mirroring spiral motion; short declaratives return when she stops counting. Lyle’s dialogue is thin, steady, machine-calibrated—distinct without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“dark lake bloom”), and paid off in camera translation. High information density: one sentence often advances setting, emotion, and causality. Only nit: “like small insects” for drive ticks is familiar, but it does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bureaucratic ghosthood with analog ink divination feels inevitable yet unseen before. Porcelain shard as stress-map and error-archive transforms a trope into lived engineering metaphor. Risk in digital-afterlife voice pays off by remaining limited, non-omniscient. Final reconfiguration—corrected ledger plus kept failures—could not survive name/place swap.</comment>
