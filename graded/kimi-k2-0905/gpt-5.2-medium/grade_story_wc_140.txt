<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s synesthetic “sound-into-touch” filter is embodied every time he steers a forklift or pockets a scrap of voice; the layering of stolen stories gives him provisional selfhood, and the final act of dispersing the solvent-smeared files is a credible renunciation that costs him the very archive he craves. Interior contradiction is alive—he both cherishes and scatters the names—yet the beat-to-beat micro-choices (prying open 9H, hiding folders, whispering names) keep agency on the page. The only minor drag is a slight over-articulation of the metaphor (“I had become a vessel”) that momentarily abstracts the body under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator stands nameless at dawn, the tide erasing footprints while the rescued names thicken the air—cost is felt in the irrevocable dispersal of the archive that once anchored him. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tide cycle and overheard shard layers density until the pattern break of 9H reweights the stake from personal erasure to custodial surrender. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Port of Larkspur”), and causality remains intact—every stolen story is a because that leads to the therefore of scattering the files.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The container maze functions as micro-setting: its shifting corridors force the narrator to navigate by chalk ghosts and vocal texture, and the final corridor where he whispers names is spatially coherent and charged. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—diesel breath becomes burlap on skin, a whisper becomes wet silk—guiding both movement and emotional stakes. The tide clock is a lived constraint, not backdrop; it determines when 9H can be opened and when footprints vanish, directly shaping the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erased identity versus reclaimed memory—is signaled in the opening clause. Escalation is textural: each collected fragment tightens the narrator’s dependence on stolen voices until the discovery of 9H forces the decisive choice to scatter rather than possess the names. The price—permanent self-effacement in exchange for keeping the names alive in air—is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: bureaucratic forgetting is countered by oral salvage, yet the salvager must vanish to preserve the archive. The poison label’s skull icon reweights from threat to invitation, charging the closing image with conceptual cost—memory survives only when the rememberer dissolves. No moral is declared; the port’s appetite for erasure remains insatiable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent synesthetic perceptual signature; syntax lengthens under reflection and shortens during the prying of 9H, mirroring risk. No head-hopping; diction stays within the stevedore-class lexicon except for one elevated flourish (“custodial surrender”) that reads as earned transcendence rather than register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the port fed on forgetting” compresses institutional critique into six words. No loops or scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent (sound-as-textile, tide-as-eraser). One near-mixed metaphor—“paper bite like a warning with teeth”—is vivid enough to pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a living man erased by paperwork who then becomes an anti-archivist of the dead feels fresh; the synesthetic night-shift stevedore angle is specific and unborrowed. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-revelatory ending, yet the resonance deepens precisely because the narrator disappears into the air he has thickened with names.</comment>
