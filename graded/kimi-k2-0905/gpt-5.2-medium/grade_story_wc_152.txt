<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s “foolish seamstress” mask is embodied in every micro-choice—off-key humming, braid unravelling, deliberate mis-stitching—so the disguise feels lived, not declared. The internal contradiction (listening vs. stitching, complicity vs. resistance) stays active in-scene, and the final half-tooth nudge shows a visible cost: she forfeits immediate safety to keep the real map alive. Only the Guard lieutenant remains a one-note functionary, preventing the top band.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is immaculate: intercepted errors → stitched mis-map → orrery sync → beacon-log proof → tube sent to printers. The “click” moment delivers a Decisive Change: the city’s hidden dock is now documented, the coup’s logistics exposed, Liora’s path irreversibly treasonous. Cost is legible in the final held-breath silence and the half-tooth mis-sync that could still hang her. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dome, autumn wind, brass orrery, and eternal flame are never backdrop: the flame’s twin shadows literally reveal the chosen conspiracy route; the orrery’s half-tooth slip rewrites the lieutenant’s badge log. Sensory hierarchy obeys Liora’s chart-maker eye—starlight, thread tension, metallic smell of lamp oil—so every detail pressures choice. Micro-setting (linen over gears) functions as the pivot object that constrains the final sync.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the unheard stories reach the river printers?—tightens exactly once: when the beacon tones click into her stitched lies, the option to remain a passive listener dies. Agency is continuous: she intercepts, encodes, risks oil waste charges, and finally mis-synchronizes the orrery to protect the evidence. Cost is on-page: eternal flame cupped in her hand, she trades anonymity for complicity; the Guard’s laughter now carries lethal potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between thread and signal: stories invisible to ink become the sabot that shatters a coup. Subtext lives in gesture—Kest’s softened voice, the lieutenant’s lantern rhythm—never in exposition. Final image of “held breath” reweights earlier echoed silence from emptiness to pregnant risk, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. The refrain of “unheard stories” migrates from abstract desire to material evidence, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Liora’s perceptual filter—starpaths as thread-count, beacon tones as stitched knots—producing a distinct textile astronomy idiom. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under threat (“nudged the orrery half a tooth”). Kest’s coded banter and the lieutenant’s blunt demand carry separate cadences; no head-hopping. Free-indirect thought (“singing planets”) sells the foolish mask without voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs scene-setting, character beat, and metaphor (“flame…old enough to have witnessed every lie”). No paraphrase loops; each return of “echoed silence” accrues new tonal weight. Figurative control stays precise—starpaths as thread, twin shadows as timeline split—without mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s held breath is earned by prior rhythmic escalation, not imposed lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Embroidery-as-espionage feels inevitable yet fresh; the orrery-beacon sync converts celestial mechanics into forensic proof, a synthesis not seen in canon. Adjacent possibilities weaponize quantum-lite worldbuilding without exposition dumps. Risk is taken—quiet climax, no chase scene—but the reconfiguration of “echoed silence” into imminent revolt lands harder than gunfire. Specificity of misaligned starbursts as data packets makes the concept un-portable.</comment>
