<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Orin’s grief-driven obsession is sharply embodied in brass-and-salt imagery and micro-choices (winding the yoyo backward, surrendering the rescue). The renunciation is credible, but the sister remains off-stage; no relationship crucible or status pressure is tested on-page, so the arc is solitary and the interior contradiction is pronounced yet static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: sailor’s rumor → yoyo puzzle → stone ritual → surrender. The decisive change—letting the moment pass—lands with visible cost (“he rowed away knowing…”) and reweights the premise under a causal lens. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by 90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Low-tide geography, barnacled flats, and the lantern’s cracked lenses are tactile and POV-filtered. The hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual; removing either collapses the climax. One hairline slip: “weed-dark water” mixed with “teeth of stone” is nearly mixed-metaphor but still legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rewrite the drowned day—signaled early; pressure tightens when the stone demands a price, forcing a single irrevocable choice. Escalation is causal and one-turn, sufficient for 700 words; the forfeiture of rescue is felt on-page. Could use one earlier micro-cost (fatigue, blood on copper) to push past 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: the only escape from fate is relinquishing the need to edit it. The lighthouse beam reframes prior gears-and-grief imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was surrender wisdom or despair—yielding resonance beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Orin’s clockmaker perception: gears, circuits, counter-motions. Syntax is rhythmic, tactile, salt-grained; no filter-verb clutter. The voice modulates under pressure—short sentences at the flare—“Radiance poured not outward but inward…” Distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops, varied sentence lengths. Figurative language is controlled; only one near-muddle (“teeth of stone” beside “weed-dark”) but image remains legible. No artifacts near closure; final beam sentence lands clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines clockmaker futility with a hunger-stone lighthouse and bone-yoyo ritual—specific synthesis, not checklist. The “reverse motion as surrender” twist reweights familiar time-travel grief without a trope dump. Fresh inflection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
