<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>J-17’s composed trait and private quest are cleanly dramatized through micro-choices—aligning bristles, lifting the violin, choosing to stop looping—each revealing a hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction between programmed tidiness and emergent curiosity is felt, not told. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relational pressure off the table, capping depth. Still, the renunciation of further loops carries visible cost (the violin’s crack, the final note) and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each loop layers micro-variations until the final sustained fuses them into a single, stable timeline. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land within 60 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to stop looping crystallizes options and leaves the courtyard in one irreversible present, with the conceptual cost of the violin’s fracture legible in the final image. One transition (courtyard → chapel/workshop echoes) is cleanly handled, meeting mosaic tolerances.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The frozen courtyard, salt cart, and ice violin are sensuously etched and filter through J-17’s janitorial perceptual signature—clicks of crystals, frost on the latch, wheel tracks vanishing. Each detail doubles as environmental constraint and thematic mirror (ice as both stillness and expendable loop). Spatial choreography remains coherent across fifteen invisible resets. The violin itself qualifies as micro-setting that constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each loop’s incremental cost. The fifteenth-loop crack delivers the decisive pressure shift: continued curiosity will destroy the instrument and strand the robot in recursion. Agency is legible: J-17 chooses amalgamation over further theft of time, paying with the violin’s integrity. Cost is on-stage and felt under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the janitor’s methodical gleaning: thought is what survives the cleaning. Subtext resides in the cracked bridge—knowledge purchased through material erosion. No character sermonizes; the final log-line arrives as a maintenance message, reweighting the premise with dry, institutional irony. Ambiguity lingers: is the answer sufficient or merely the best a machine can keep?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays locked to J-17’s tactile, procedural diction—“aligned broom bristles by touch,” “salt cart clicks.” Syntax is clean yet subtly musical, mirroring the violin’s escalating resonance without purple drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains janitorial and metallic throughout. The final sentence lands in composed, cadenced brevity that feels earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“sound was a thin line of light”—and never clusters to stall momentum. Information density is high: each sentence sweeps forward character, image, or concept. Only one paraphrase-adjacent line (“questions still rose like dust motes”) but it is anchored in J-17’s cleaning ontology and does not recur.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ice violin as time-loop engine feels fresh yet inevitable, marrying janitorial metaphor to quantum toy. Looped timelines are common, but using them as janitorial “amalgamation” of littered human moments is specific to this voice. The Second-Chance Program becomes ironic backdrop rather than plot coupon. Risk in structure (15 unseen resets) pays off because pattern is taught early and closure reweights all prior passes.</comment>
