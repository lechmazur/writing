<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s shift from needing “plain answers” to accepting an opaque, embodied grief is credibly embodied in micro-choices (naming anger, deciding on the truthful lie). Interiority stays concrete; the final renunciation costs him the comfort of hatred for the car. Lio remains more oracle than person, but his function is not to change, only to witness and transfer pressure. No internal contradiction is staged in scene—anger is declared, not enacted—so the arc approaches but doesn’t fully hit 9-band earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror’s stored failure re-weights the narrator’s assumption that loss was solely his, with the cost of lifelong omission to his parents. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost-reading beat thickens emotional density until the prism re-casts the same light across the bedroom ceiling, crystallizing the new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—anger’s named refusal cracks the hush—suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, river clay, frost-filmed windshield, and rear-view mirror are not backdrop but instruments: the frost pattern is literally read, the mirror flares to deliver the voice. Micro-setting (prism, mirror) constrains the final image and re-casts moonlight across the narrator’s ceiling, charging closure. Sensory selection skews visual, but the tactile grounding of boots, hood, and glass keeps it from postcard syndrome. Idiom stays consistent with blue-collar salvage-yard locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he cling to anger or release it—tightens when the hush crackles after he names the feeling, foreclosing the option to keep hating the car. Pressure is textural: each frost breath adds emotional load rather than external danger, fitting the Accumulative lens. No visible resource loss, but the price is the permanent omission he must now practice on his parents. One decisive intensification satisfies the length; could use a second beat of friction to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is not a private wound but a communal residue that objects carry until someone listens. The truthful lie the narrator tells becomes the thematic answer—love leaves evidence, yet we must choose what can be spoken. Subtext lives in gesture: palm to hood grounds the moment back into metal, sealing the transfer of custody. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is left in moonlight spectra on the ceiling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise, slightly numbed perceptual signature—frost “filigree,” “shifted hush,” “sealed jar”—that stays consistent under stress. No dialogue from the narrator; Lio’s speech is ritual-formal but distinct enough to mark role, not personhood. Psychic distance tightens palpably when the mirror flares and the narrator hears weight, not words. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for description, clipped fragments at the crackle moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“water in stone” is sustained, not contradicted. One filter-verb cluster (“I felt… I heard…”) appears in the climax but is justified by the narrator’s stunned reception. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propelling and resolving the arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit that wrecked cars absorb unspent grief is fresh, rendered through specific ritual (frost reading, prism refraction) rather than magical hand-waving. Risk is taken with quiet, lyric escalation instead of external danger; it pays off in the final bedroom image. Transformation test fails if sedan/prism are swapped—proof the elements are inseparable. No close echoes of famous grief-car metaphors; the execution feels singular.</comment>
