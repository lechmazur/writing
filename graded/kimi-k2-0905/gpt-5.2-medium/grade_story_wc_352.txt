<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s prism-mindedness is shown through concrete micro-choices—breathing on ink, aligning breath with shimmer, sowing seeds—so motive stays embodied. The final recognition that his superstition is actually a key gives a credible, earned shift. No interior contradiction is staged in-scene, so the arc flirts with tidy rather than torn, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: doodle → grotto → seeds → door → spoken combinations, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—by voicing the codes he re-weights forgetting itself, paying the cost of exposure as the chamber collapses. One tight deepening, no causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment is filtered through archivist senses: cipher manuals, vellum scent, kelp-bound books. The grotto’s gravity inversion and viscous air actively constrain movement and tactics. Prism light, seeds, and calcite door each function as micro-settings that gate choices. Final image of falling books recharges the archive metaphor with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost combinations before smugglers/kings—is signaled early and tightened when the chamber begins to collapse; speaking the codes aloud forecloses secrecy. Price is legible: he gains the patterns but loses the hidden archive. One meaningful escalation beat satisfies length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-commodity emerges from the grotto harvesting forgotten passwords; no explicit thesis stated. Final reconfiguration—sharing codes to resist silence—reweights the value of recall versus concealment. Particulars (poppy seeds, luminous ink) carry the idea without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Ilya’s perceptual filter: “prism-minded,” “blank spaces,” “lantern gone.” Syntax is crisp, rhythmic, slightly archaic without purple drift. No head-hop; psychic distance narrows under pressure. Voice remains distinct and consistent to the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective (“water dripped upward,” “door of calcite smooth as a book cover”) and never clusters to clog urgency. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean mechanics, strong verbs, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Archive-of-forgotten-passwords guarded by anti-gravity grotto feels fresh yet inevitable. Seeds-as-keys and luminous spiral-path transform familiar quest tropes into conceptual landscape. Specificity—poppy seeds dropped to trace decisions—makes the device unforgettable. Risk-taking structure pays off in closure.</comment>
