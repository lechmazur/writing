<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—guild-trained logic vs. secret sentiment—are dramatized in the orchard beats: she first clings to rules, then lets the starlings rewrite the ratio while whispering her mother’s jam-jar memory. The final smile at the “impossible freshness” shows earned change with visible cost: she accepts wonder as co-author, not enemy. Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. The -0.3 keeps her out of 9-band because the council’s authority is declared, never embodied; the external stake remains abstract, muting the cost’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pale ingot rings, starlings bless it, and Liora’s smile reconfigures her stance—logic now married to intuition—at undeniable conceptual cost to her guild identity. Causal linkage holds: because she watches the birds, therefore she grasps the ratio; because she accepts the memory, therefore the metal brightens. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“valley where the air always tasted newly washed”). No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes options without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall bends light into “slow, ancient freshness,” a sensory filter that mirrors Liora’s cognitive shift; the orchard’s silver-barked trees and rain-on-stone scent constrain her to trust non-quantifiable inputs. The cracked basin and ash-black hearth act as micro-setting tools that literally hold the crucible, grounding the alchemical beat. Environment charges the final image: the ingot reflects the waterfall’s colors, tying setting to closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or impossible distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove transmutation without losing her authentic wonder—tightens when the starlings offer the missing ratio, forcing a public-guild vs. private-self trade-off. Escalation is single yet meaningful: the crystal’s dissolution flash raises the cost of failure, and the orchard air “rang softly,” signaling irreversible change. Agency is hers: she chooses to stir by intuition while logic “checked the measure.” Cost is legible—she risks guild censure—but slightly abstract because the council stays off-page, capping entry to 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder as rigorous epistemic partner, not logic’s enemy—emerges through the starlings’ pattern and the mother-jam memory, never sermonized. The final image of “impossible freshness” reweights prior material: what was soft sentiment is now validated alloy. Subtext lives in gesture: her hands shake, then steady, signaling internal treaty. No thematic echo in final paragraph; complexity remains—guild authority still looms, unpaid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: she notices “small music in leaves,” smells “apple blossoms,” reads sky-ink ratios. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under guild anxiety; no head-hop. Diction stays within alchemical lexicon without jargon dump. Voice modulation peaks when “the roar turned into a hush,” mirroring her cognitive flip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm echoing the crucible’s heat-cool cycles. Figurative language is selective: “single dark cloth” for starlings, “door opening on a room she had always owned” for epiphany—no mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One minor scaffold—“she needed flame”—could be cut, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Alchemy-plus-ornithomancy feels fresh because the starlings’ murmuration becomes a living equation, solving a ratio no formula could. The orchard lab behind a prismatic waterfall is a specific, non-generic wonder-space. Risk is taken: wonder is not soft but instrumental, yet the story commits fully. Slight deduction for familiar “council demands proof” frame; the transmutation metal is new, but the institutional pressure trope is standard.</comment>
