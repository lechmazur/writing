<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. bodily fusion—drives every micro-choice; the thickened nails and root-taste are visceral cost. The final renunciation of control is earned because her prior scrubbing and measuring fail, leaving the tactile intimacy she both feared and courted. Circuitous sincerity shows in how she deflects customers with stories while her hands betray her; the trait alters tactics, not just tone. One slip: the boy’s instant comprehension feels like an external validation rather than a pressure she must survive.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each storm-beat adds sensory density until the leaf reconfigures her stance. The closure is a Charged Poise—she mails her data but keeps the leaf—cost is the irreversible bodily change and the surrender of observer distance. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“smallest plant nursery on the coastal highway”). No causal cheat; the metamorphosis escalates through repeated tactile contact, not coincidence.</comment>

<comment>Salt-rinsed air, gutter dripline, and the trellis’s wet crack function as micro-setting that actively steers her rebuilt design. The leaf itself becomes portable setting, constraining choice when its taste delivers foreign street-maps she can’t unknow. Storm season timeframe is tracked by sign-loosening and final loosening of her joints, locking atmosphere to body. One minor drift: “office” first appears unlocated, but greenhouse context repairs it within two lines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve analytical distance vs. allow vegetal intimacy—tightens when each leaf-touch thickens her nails and dilates plant-breath perception. Mid-story scrubbing and list-making are visible tactics that fail, forcing the final release-of-control reversal. Cost is on-page: altered hands, bitter tongue, forfeited objectivity. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the trellis falls; a second external complication could have sharpened the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through tactile inversion: knowledge grows not by scrutiny but by surrender. The leaf’s final resting place in her journal reweights earlier “evidence” into lived alliance without moralizing. Subtext of fear vs. longing is carried in silence—she thanks the vines aloud, a gesture never narrated to customers. Bitterness on tongue supplies conceptual repricing: insight tastes like foreign sap, not triumph.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice maintains perceptual signature of a recorder: barometric numbers, runoff angles, “circuitously sincere” diction that circles every direct claim. Syntax lengthens and vines during vegetal episodes, then tightens when she scrubs—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No head-hop; the boy’s nod is surface-only, filtered through her surprise. Compressed storm grammar (“clouds still ripping apart”) teaches the reader to accept lyric elision early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots tasting minerals” fuses body and botany in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay vegetal—no mixed vehicles—and climax in the root-tongue image. A single filter-verb cluster (“she realized… she understood… she began to suspect”) slightly dulls the peak beat; trim would push 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-horror meets quiet epistemological romance; plant cognition is felt, not asserted. The reluctant metamorphosis trope is inverted—she neither becomes tree nor hero, but translator. Risk in letting vines self-design pays off narratively and thematically. One echo of “leaf as coin” nears cliché, but immediate submersion into barometric data rescues specificity.</comment>
