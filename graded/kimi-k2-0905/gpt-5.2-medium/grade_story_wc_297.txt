<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized—she tracks the rumor, produces the clipping, offers her own blood—but the visionary’s choices are all oracular instruction; because his agency is passive, the relationship crucible never shifts under pressure and the final reunion feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: clipping → access, wound → key, blood → seal; the eclipsed covenant’s crack and repair create a decisive change with visible cost (her reopened scar, his flaring scars). One micro-turn inside the vision-maze is sufficient; orientation is anchored by word 80 and the lens stays causal to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt glade’s metallic leaves and sap-breathing visionary are tactile and specific; the topiary sprig functions as micro-setting that literally maps the crossing. Environment constrains every move—leaves guide, roots bind, dusk lifts—charging the final “present that could wait” with sensory after-image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover mother before leaking futures devour the present—is signaled early and tightened once: the cracked seal lets dreams tear each other “like dogs,” forcing Lysa to pay with blood. Cost is legible on-page; escalation is linear but sufficient for 725 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared wounds stitching a livable future emerges through scar-network and blood-seal images; no character moralizes. The final dimness that “carried them back to a present that could wait” reweights time itself without sermon, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual filter—“anxious elation,” “tasted of rain”—with rhythmic, slightly elevated diction that matches mythic tone. No head-hop; visionary’s interior is accessed only through external cues (scars flare, eyelids tremor), keeping distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; figurative density is high but patterned (leaves/rivers/disks) and never clutters the climactic blood-to-seal beat. One near-loop: “future arrived early” appears twice in opening 60 words; otherwise no scaffold or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Future arriving early” and oracle rooted in soil fuse tech-myth and eco-body horror into a singular image set; the scar-linked collective dream-network feels fresh yet inevitable. Risky compression pays off—725 words hold a complete cosmology without exposition dumps.</comment>
