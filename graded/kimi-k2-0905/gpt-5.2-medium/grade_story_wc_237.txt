<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ila’s contradictory impulses—terror of storms vs. need to master them—play out in real time through trembling quill-strokes; the burn-scar micro-runes she inks onto her own arm externalize the cost and lock the change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation of shame is earned because the rune she writes literally incorporates her brother’s weight once carried. Voice remains singular; master is functional backdrop, not relationship crucible, so bullet waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fourth circle gives the storm a sanctioned mouth, turning threat into sustained note; shame is shed on-page as crystalline ink softens under pulse. Causal lens holds—because she adds the childhood forbidden circle, therefore the platform steadies and her scars become legible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“floating rock tea ceremony platform”). No lens ambiguity; cost is the visible dark line that will not fracture, persistent constraint for future pilots.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Platform chains, mica-tea ink, and the crow quill itself constrain every tactical choice; ink’s crystalline stress response is the physics that can shatter the rune if her hand trembles. Saturated hush is rendered through mineral scent and whitening facets, anchoring POV bias. Body-as-setting functions when burn scars become the parchment for the final micro-history. Spatial choreography is clean: kettle, brazier, table, her forearm—objects track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into readable stories—faces one decisive tightening: add the fourth circle or lose the platform. Agency is inscription under held breath; failure means glittering fracture and literal fall. Cost is immediate—ink tries to crystalize under pulse, but brother-rune warms it, trading brittleness for permanent dark line. Escalation is causal: childhood superstition revisited becomes the stabilizing act; no coincidence resolves the storm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: scars become scripture when given language; violence converted to signal rather than erased. Subtext lives in the rune that lets the storm speak instead of silencing it—an ethical reorientation from control to dialogue. Final image of gleaming, readable scars offers conceptual repricing: shame transmuted into cultural artifact. No moralizing statement; resonance is carried by crystallized ink that will guide future pilots.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is scholar-poet: mineral scent of cloudleaf steam, lattice of burns, mica-tea ink observed under stress. Syntax lengthens during held-breath hush, then fractures into shorter units as facets whiten. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Free indirect style stays clean: “she felt something in her chest shed” keeps psychic distance consistent. No head-hopping; master’s whisper is external stimulus only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the storm: cumulative clauses build hush, then single stressed verbs (“ink flashed, crystal facets forming”) mimic crystalline snap. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative layer is coherent—storm as voice, ink as skin—without mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors upside-down bowl platform; final line tucks quill into sleeve, cadence closing like a lid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy tea-ceremony on anti-gravity rock fused with mica ink that crystalizes under stress feels inevitable yet unseen. Childhood superstition (three circles) transformed into aerodynamic rune science delivers fresh inflection. Risk of fourth circle “gate that lets the storm speak” pays off ethically rather than catastrophically, avoiding cliché domination-of-nature. Specificity of cloudleaf mineral scent and burn-scar micro-script makes premise impossible to transplant without gutting the piece.</comment>
