<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “grim optimist” is vividly embodied—notebook against ribs, sore calves, dice roll as theorem—showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation (refusing to imagine a better landing) is earned by the prior proof-lemma chain and visibly costs him the wheel’s hum and the staircase’s promise. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the Mara memory remains a touch under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wheel stalls when he re-prices belief itself, a felt cost rendered in the sudden widening of the stairwell. Causal chain (dice roll → lemma → rupture → wheel halt) holds without gaps; every beat advances knowledge or options. Orientation is taught by the third sentence; infinite staircase rule is clear. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase’s recursive geometry and the brass wheel’s click are tactile constraints that shape tactics—he climbs because the steps supply the energy his expectation feeds back into. Micro-setting (chipped die, stone rail) doubles as emotional mirror without overt symbolism. Sensory selection narrows to sound once the wheel stops, charging the final image. One of the strongest examples of setting-as-mechanism in the submission pool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the texture of the missed opportunity”—tightens when each landing’s math fails, forcing the final wager with the dice. The perpetual wheel embodies the stake: stop it and the opportunity texture is accepted as lost. Escalation is one sustained because/therefore curve; no false reversals. Cost is legible in the wheel’s cough and the widening silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the proof structure itself: expectation as hidden fuel, grief as perpetual motion. Final image—dice set beside the stalled wheel—reweights every prior equation without moralizing. No thematic echo sentences; meaning stays implicit. Ambiguity lingers (is the stair still infinite?) yet feels earned rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a mathematician’s precision—“numbers were my lockpicks”—yet aches with embodied fatigue. Syntax lengthens during proofs, then fractures at the rupture, mirroring stress. No head-hopping; diction stays within narrator’s lexicon. Only a single elevated phrase—“boundless confinement made architecture”—flirts with abstraction, but the context justifies it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; clauses stack like steps, then break into monosyllables when the wheel stalls. No filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Metaphors are sparse and clean—“flaw that sounded like truth”—and never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“each step was the same height, each turn the same angle”) is purposeful patterning, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Infinite staircase + perpetual motion + mathematical proof as grief-coping engine feels fresh, not gimmicky; the synthesis is inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using equations as emotional beats—pays off because the math is dramatized via dice and wheel. No close echoes of well-known stair stories; the chipped die specificity prevents generic drift. Concept commits fully, no retreat into metaphor alone.</comment>
