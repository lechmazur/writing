<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste’s contradictory impulses—expose fraud vs. spare the observatory—play out in embodied micro-choices (testing plates, scratching the logbook). The rosewood nib as inherited conscience keeps her from repeating her father’s spectacle; the final renunciation costs her the scoop and risks her paper’s buzz, a price felt in the closing phone call.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tremor in Lyle’s voice → Celeste’s trip → plate-dust contradiction → Sato’s confession → Celeste’s quiet bargain. Closure is a Decisive Change: she trades headline glory for institutional survival, the cost legible in the scratched logbook that now binds her to complicity and protection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Skylight rain, cable-car ascent, red-lit darkroom—each tactile detail filters through Celeste’s investigative bias. The echoing dome externalizes her rehearsed doubts and later “applauds” her choice, a micro-setting that charges the final image without ornamental overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus collateral damage—tightens when contradictions corner Sato. Celeste’s agency forces the quiet bargain; the felt price is the forfeited exposé and her own entanglement, a narrowing of options that satisfies causal escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Orbits of regret” emerges through concrete re-use: father’s fatal orbit, Sato’s fake planet, Celeste’s choice to keep the false world spinning to avert collapse. Final image of “busy for years” reweights the trope—truth now means maintenance, not detonation—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Celeste’s skeptical perceptual lens; diction (“newsprint heiress,” “rosewood nib”) skews literary but remains hers. No head-hopping; syntax tightens under pressure (“she traced each contradiction as if it were a small moon”) and relaxes into wry final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (“white sea,” “orbit of regret”) is selective and purposeful, never crowding causality. Clean mechanics; only minor over-modifying (“practiced wonder”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fraudulent-planet trope is inverted: the hoax is protective, not mercenary. Celeste’s editorial blackmail to save science is fresh, and the rosewood nib as ethical scalpel particularizes the inheritance theme. Risky quiet resolution lands because groundwork is laid.</comment>
