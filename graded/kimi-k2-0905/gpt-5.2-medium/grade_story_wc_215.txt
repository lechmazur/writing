<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s quiet, hoarding grief is embodied in the stained-glass box and the ritual of reading ghosts; the final release of the slips shows a credible, costly shift. Interiority stays concrete—wax scent on tongue, dust on a child’s knees—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is that the sister’s forgiveness line is delivered as a slip rather than earned through an in-scene choice, slightly blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: reading the slips aloud dissolves the ghosts and reweights the oasis from mausoleum to “a place that could be tended.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each spoken sentence peels a ghost away, tightening the pattern until Mara’s last slip releases the narrator. Orientation is swift—oasis, dry spring, hive ring by line 30—and the lens holds. Cost is visible in the final image of the nodding sister and the emptied box glowing under moon-coloured glass.</comment>

<comment>The cracked hive circle, wax-ash wind, and stained-glass lantern are not backdrop; they constrain every move—ghosts cluster at the box, narrator must step outside to the dry spring to finish the ritual. Micro-setting (the box) literally charges the final image as moonlight “spills” through its emptied panes. Sensory hierarchy is beekeeper-sharp: scent of wax, taste of ash, colour moving over absent faces. No slack verisimilitude; every detail either blocks or enables the final release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or relinquish the weight of unspoken words—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each slip read aloud; every ghost-step backward is a visible price that narrows the narrator’s option to keep hoarding. One meaningful escalation: opening the box in moonlight transforms static collection into irreversible speech. No reversals beyond that, but the accumulative pattern suffices for 800-word scope. Cost is legible in the hush after Mara’s slip and the sudden feel of “tended again,” a charged poise that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox that silence can be heavier than speech; the narrator’s caretaking of unsaid sentences becomes its own curse. Subtext lives in gesture—ghost fingers reaching for absent pouches, dust on knees—never explained. The final release avoids moralising; the valley simply feels different, inviting future tending. The stained-glass box reweights from reliquary to lantern without authorial nudge, letting image carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a beekeeper’s perceptual signature: reading weather by hive pitch, tasting ash like unspoken vows. Syntax lengthens under grief, then shortens as slips are read, mirroring exhalation. No head-hop; ghost interiority is strictly surface-read. Compressed lyric diction (“the valley’s own grief”) stays anchored in sensory ground; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often does two jobs—“the wind carried ash that settled on my tongue like vows I never spoke” fuses sensory, metaphor, and backstory. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each slip reading is a fresh, concrete image. Figurative layering is controlled—moonlight “spills” only once, at the charged poise. Minor micro-movement clutter (“stepped backward into the scorched air”) could lose two words, but nothing obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper tending ghosts with salvaged sentences feels genuinely new, yet grows inevitably from lived detail rather than gimmick. The covenant knot, stained-glass reliquary, and mute eloquence synthesize into a singular atmospheric stance. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final lantern-image. Could swap names, but the sensorial hive-logic and sentence-ritual are irreplicable.</comment>
