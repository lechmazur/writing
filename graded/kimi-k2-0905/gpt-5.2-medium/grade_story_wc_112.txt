<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s obliging nature is shown through embodied action—tightening gloves, levering the nexus—rather than label. The internal contradiction between curiosity and custodial caution is dramatized in the split-second she chooses repair over data, paying the cost of letting Sen keep the secret. The gliders’ synchronized sigh externalizes her micro-choice, cementing earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: skipped clocks → nexus test → lever pull → rotor revision → restored stasis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lever returns to neutral but the station now carries the sideways scar, felt in Mara's bone-tug memory. Cost is legible—“time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets”—and the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost on the dome and micro-heated gloves create tactile polarity that mirrors the theme. The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting: its field lines constrain Mara's wrench turn and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean from cage row to roof ladder; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—station integrity versus scientific breakthrough—tightens when Mara foresees the rotor shearing the aviary. One meaningful escalation: she climbs to the roof while the nexus is still live, trading Sen’s data desire for her own custodial agency. Price is the unquantifiable sideways memory she now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: sideways time as toolbox, not highway. The gliders’ subdued awakenings embody the ethical limit—knowledge must not disturb what it studies. Final line reframes earlier frost/heat imagery into quiet warning, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara's perceptual bias—she notices grease viscosity, rotor stress, magnetic gooseflesh. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She levered the brass handle down a notch, and waited for something to break.” No head-hopping; Sen’s interior is inferred only through Mara's read of her grip on the console.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Frost filmed the observation dome, yet radiator grids under the floor gave the corridors an icy warmth” does three jobs in one line. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“lung holding its breath”—but it is taught early and echoed by glider sigh, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum biology meets blue-collar maintenance. The sideways-time-as-repair-manual angle is non-obvious and makes the speculative concept emotionally specific. Risk is taken with lyric compression rather than exposition, and it pays off in the final reprise of frost/heat.</comment>
