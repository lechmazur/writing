<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction is dramatized in the bargain she cuts—offering her own pain-amnesia to shield Jory—so the final endurance costs her every dawn. Interiority stays concrete (“yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn”) and the micro-choice to burn the card fully on the tomb lid crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-tagging (“reckless idealist”) early on; once in scene she earns every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira’s refusal to harvest a stranger’s destiny locks her into perpetual pain yet safeguards Jory, a cost legible in the last line. Causal chain holds—because the knot was slipping, therefore she offers her forgetting, therefore the thread grafts to her wrist. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3) and the single-scene default is met. The ash falling “like dark pollen” supplies the charged image that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop; root angles dictate Mira’s turns and the silver thread stretched between a child’s tooth and Jory’s name physically anchors the magic. Lantern height—not brightness—alters what can be seen, so light mechanics shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors damp, mineral sweetness and the soft clack of bone apples, all filtered through Mira’s risk-averse gaze. Environment plus tool (lantern) jointly constrain the final bargain, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Jory’s soul vs. Mira’s future joy—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the knot is shown to be slipping. The midpoint reversal (someone else is secretly selling Jory’s restored destiny) escalates under causal lens, forcing Mira to invent a costlier lock. Price is visible on-page: the silver thread burrows into her wrist, daily pain becomes immutable. One tightening suffices at this length and it forecloses the option of ever forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transaction logic: salvation that depends on another’s erosion is intolerable; bearing pain oneself becomes the only ethical currency. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira lifts the lantern “not brighter, only higher,” a quiet assertion of scrutiny over violence. The final image of “holes…became seams she could live with” reweights the concept of wholeness without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is her vigilance enough to keep brokers away? The question feels productive, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter: roots are “runes,” bone heaps “punctuation,” a broker’s smile “thin as onion skin.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Take my ability to forget pain, she said”) then widens for the aftermath. No head-hopping; even Vey’s unease is shown through Mira’s reading of facial micro-detail. Voice remains distinct and purposeful through the final ash-fall image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or choice. Figurative language is selective (“skulls like pale apples,” “ash…like dark pollen”) and never clusters into purple. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; temporal sequence is clean. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with mirrored light-and-pollen imagery, giving the piece a satisfying cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Destiny orchard” could have felt gimmicky, but the economics are concrete—threads, teeth, tomb-lid ledgers—and the moral calculus is freshly cruel. Mira’s solution (offer forgetting as a tamper-proof seal) flips the usual heroic theft-of-fate trope into self-anchored responsibility. The image of trees growing from ribcages is memorable yet integral to navigation and bargaining. Risk-taking (lyric compression, single-scene mythic economy) pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
