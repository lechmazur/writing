<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays concrete; the narrator’s fear-of-speech is embodied in the throat-gate image and tracked through micro-choices (offering the hair, naming Altair). The final release feels earned because each beat has tightened the ribbon around the stakes. The locksmith remains a cipher, but his function as catalyst is internally consistent; the real arc is the narrator’s self-key-turn. Cost is visible: the pool swallows the old laughter and the ribbon comes back re-braided—an irreversible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky-room turns, the comma-click opens the chest, and the new star-map is spoken aloud—an irreversible conceptual re-pricing with felt weight. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal, but the pattern is taught early (disorienting stairs, lantern without flame) and holds to the final image. Orientation is deliberately fluid yet always legible; the ravine’s topology pays off by mirroring the internal spiral. No teleporting props; the hair, ribbon, and star-reflections track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ravine-observatory is evoked through cold-metal air and sliding geometry; every sensory note either disorients or steadies the narrator in tandem with the internal arc. The black pool doubles the sky and becomes the decisive mirror that reconfigures meaning—an environment that literally constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is maintained despite metamorphosing stairs; bodies and objects never float. Micro-setting (the ribbon warming the wrist) charges the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the unspeakable idea—signals early and tightens through each disorienting turn; the pool’s blink forces a single star-choice that forecloses anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each spiral adds vertigo and star-density until the comma-tool clicks; cost is the surrendered laughter and the exposed map. No external antagonist needed; fear itself supplies coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: articulation requires surrendering the very shield (laughter, self-mockery) that once protected the dreamer. Subtext lives in gesture—the locksmith never touches the lips, yet the lock opens inside the ribs. The final image of the ravine closing like a book reweights earlier secrecy without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; the piece trusts the reader to feel the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a consistent stargazer's perceptual signature: cosmic scale filtered through bodily detail (ribbon warming wrist, throat as gate). Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the clipped “I said, too softly, Altair,” mirroring the click of release. No head-hop; lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but subtextually loaded, maintaining distance appropriate to the enigmatic locksmith.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold. Figurative layering is high but coherent—mixed metaphors are avoided, and vehicles stay within the celestial/locksmith lexicon. One paraphrase loop detected (“steps turned…then a staircase again”) but it serves the disorientation pattern. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fuses folkloric “night-pool” motif with observatory science in a way that feels specific to this narrator’s childhood cartography urge. The silver comma-tool and ribbon-braid key are fresh tactile inventions rather than generic magic items. Conceptual risk—lyric disorientation as plot—pays off because the pattern is taught and closure remains legible. Not groundbreaking, but the synthesis is memorable and internally inevitable.</comment>
