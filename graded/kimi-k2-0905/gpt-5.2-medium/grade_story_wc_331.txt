<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet obsession is embodied in micro-gestures (straightening spines by millimeters, plotting triangles on catalog cards) that make her “sanely eccentric” trait credible. The scarf-triggered realization that “stories are relations” lands as a genuine conceptual shift, yet the beat is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, muting the cost. Interior contradiction is present—loneliness vs. custodial impulse—but the final choice to guide patrons remains an extension of her opening stance, so the arc feels more amplification than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the discovery that narrative space can be folded and shared reweights the premise and carries felt loneliness-cost (“her own loneliness had been a kind of closed system”). Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured angle and scented cue thickens pattern until the hyperbolic gap opens. The only drag is a mid-story block of reflective summary that slows momentum just before the pivotal reach-in beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library’s impossible architecture is delivered through tactile, POV-filtered detail—“staircases bending in ways a carpenter would deny”—and the micro-setting of the angled bookcase constrains the final action. Sensory hierarchy is sharp: river-water/coal-smoke scent arrives only when the scarf activates, so atmosphere is causal, not decorative. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or drifting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where stories “keep living”—is signaled early and tightens when the scarf’s tug makes the search material. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the hand-into-gap beat, narrowing options from cataloguing to caretaking. Cost is present but abstract (loneliness reframed, not forfeited), so pressure peaks just shy of visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as relational fabric rather than archive. The final logbook entry—“catalog the way in”—reprises opening cataloguing impulse with reweighted meaning, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in patron micro-interactions (graduate student mouthing thermodynamic yearning) enriches the idea that science and poetry share the same ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s perceptual frequency—equations shelved beside odes, angles measured with “librarian’s ruler and theorist’s patience.” Syntax mirrors her precision: long, cadenced clauses that breathe only when she exhales. No head-hopping or register drift; even the lyric final line remains inside her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence advances image or concept (“the room briefly smelled of river water and coal smoke, the way analog memories arrive without asking”). One paraphrase loop—“stories were not written objects but relations, stitched between readers and paper in curving space”—is forgivable because it crystallizes the reprice. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; paragraph cuts are crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of hyperbolic geometry with bibliophilic longing feels inevitable yet fresh; no recent venue has folded library stacks into literal extra-dimensional pockets without gimmickry. Risk—using math as emotional portal—pays off because the geometry is handled through tactile gesture rather than lecture. Specificity of “non-Euclidean elegies” and “thermodynamics of yearning” anchors the concept in lived detail.</comment>
