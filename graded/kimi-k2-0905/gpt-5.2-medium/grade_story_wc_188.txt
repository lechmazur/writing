<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jorin’s interior contradiction—playful defiance against despair—drives every beat; the moment he loops the kerosene rag round the boy’s wrist the cost is felt. Micro-choices (chant cadence synced to fuse timing) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—handing over his talisman—earns its weight because the rag has already survived “every border fire.” Only the council’s collective shift is reported, not dramatized, keeping the arc just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: mosaic note → low-burst shells → council laughter → gate opened; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sky no longer “empty” because the social rule-set has been rewritten. Cost is visible: Jorin forfeits his passport-rag and the fortress forfeits its proud starvation. One micro-transition (courtyard to river gate) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perfumed wall-gardens, soot-lid sky, and the single mis-set tile are filtered through Jorin’s pyrotechnic sensorium; every detail either guides fuse placement or foreshadows the river gate. The kerosene rag functions as micro-setting—its blackened fibres ground us in tactile risk. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from switchback to courtyard to collapse. Environment directly constrains the finale: the starless hush dictates low-trajectory shells that point laughter toward masonry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will despair be allowed to starve the camps—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when the council’s pride is the only barrier. The meaningful turn comes when playful green flowers force the council to lean forward, converting ridicule into actionable attention; options narrow from “divert riot” to “clear gate now.” Cost is legible: fortress authority is publicly undercut and the rag talisman is relinquished. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence merely complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—collective levity as insurgent civic force—emerges from the particular chemistry of black powder and famine, never abstracted. The final image of a sky “no longer empty” reweights the earlier soot-lid without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the guard’s almost-smile, the girl’s solemn grin, the boy’s trembling wrist receiving flame. Serious playfulness is sustained to the last line, achieving Charged Poise rather than tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Jorin’s pyrotechnic perceptual signature—smell of kerosene, syncopation of chant—without slippage. Syntax mirrors his craft: short controlled bursts for fuse timing, longer breaths for ambient sift. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Mirel’s bureaucratic fatigue versus Jorin’s jest about passports. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds even under peak stress of simultaneous shelling and gate-clearing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from drum-beat chant to flowing river-sentence; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sky a lid of soot-gray cloud” does dual duty as weather and emotional lid. Information density is high—every sentence advances fuse logic or social pressure. One mixed metaphor (“hope fell heavier than stone”) is minor amid otherwise clean vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing fireworks craft with humanitarian smuggling through a child’s mosaic note feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The rag knot’s evolution from survival talisman to teaching tool transforms a prop into moral currency. Risk—using spectacle to shame a starving council—pays off because the text commits fully to the premise. Synthesis of color chemistry and civic rupture is specific to this voice and setting.</comment>
