<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lio’s tactile, sound-based agency is vivid and consistent; the “listen to tools and people” line crystallizes his interiority. Blindness is not a gimmick—every beat of repair is filtered through embodied perception, and the final calibration tag shows earned competence under pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ quick test fails, capping at 8.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: failed drone → courier → fountain-light diagnosis → solder → chirp recalibration → ship departs. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s steady song reweights Sera’s risk, cost felt in the “water spilling from each link” image. Lens stays causal; no orientation debt. Minor slack: courier’s silence is unmotivated, but it doesn’t break the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist, slate channel, and refracted light are not backdrop—they are tools Lio manipulates to measure and repair. The depot’s condensation system and the fountain create a micro-setting that literally enables the climax; remove the water-light apparatus and the repair logic collapses. Sensory selection is POV-true: sound of solder, warmth of beam on knuckles. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Meridian’s safe departure—tightens when the drone fails; Lio’s micro-choices (prism angle, solder count) progressively foreclose failure. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment the bird’s chirp steadies, Sera’s option set narrows to “follow the sound.” Cost is legible in the harbor horn and the literal chain lift. No second reversal, so holds at 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “decoding feedback into direction” emerges through action, not statement; final image of Sera turning the wheel toward the sound reweights the premise. Subtext in the courier’s unease and Lio’s calm shows trust as tactile currency. No moralizing, but the reprise is slightly under-charged compared to the setup, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lio’s sensorium; diction (“angles told him where a broken thing wanted to go”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under the fountain beam. Syntax mirrors perception—short percussive clauses during solder, longer fluid ones during light alignment. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water spilling from each link like beads from Lio’s channel” does triple duty (image, rhythm, thematic echo). No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare and accurate. One filter-verb cluster (“he asked… he invited… he told”) in the final third keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan who repairs by refracted depot-light is a fresh synthesis; the fountain-as-optical-bench turns mundane infrastructure into inventive tool. Risk is taken—repair scene carried almost entirely through non-visual senses—yet clarity never wavers. Not radically new, but specificity makes the concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
