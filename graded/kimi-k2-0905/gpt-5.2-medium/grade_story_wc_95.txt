<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lysander’s “diplomatically fierce” credo is dramatized in the duel: courteous phrasing while blade and brass arm close lethal space. Micro-choices—needle card as protractor, footwork tracing anthem angles—show his mind turning questions into destinations under fire. Interior contradiction is light (no moment where he doubts the worth of exposing the map), so motivation, though consistent, stops just short of the layered pressure that would push this to 9+. Cost is visible: Veller pinned, council swayed, exile begun—but the price lands more on the city than on Lysander himself.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is airtight: rumor → sundial decoding → card seizure risk → duel → map revealed → Veller disgraced → evacuation route legitimized. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the city must now confront its own engineered exodus, and Veller walks the first mile in chains. Stakes tighten through because/therefore linkage; no off-stage shortcuts. One hairline slip: the council’s delayed arrival is mentioned but never integrated as a ticking clock that alters tactics, keeping this just under 9+ perfection.</comment>

<comment>Glass atrium, murmuring brook, half-painted sundial, and brass-arm hiss are filtered through Lysander’s tactical gaze—every detail either cools the mechanism or maps the escape route. The unfinished gnomon constrains the decoding act and later charges the final image when its shadow becomes a “baton signaling the overture,” marrying setting to closure. Spatial choreography across the duel tiles is immaculate; no floating bodies or prop drift. Environment actively shapes footwork and revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control of the evacuation route—intensifies the instant Veller demands the card. Each parry narrows Lysander’s options: surrender the map or weaponize the duel to etch it into memory. The final pin forecloses Veller’s thefts and commits the city to an exodus; price is legible in the magistrate’s first forced steps. Escalation is singular but sufficient for the word count, and agency remains with Lysander throughout.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of civil responsibility versus personal gain emerges through the anthem-turned-evacuation-route: civic art secretly prioritizes collective survival. Subtext lives in the duel’s courtesy—etiquette weaponized to serve a public good. Final image of Veller marching under guard embodies the cost of privatizing shared safety. No moralizing statement is needed; the routed song speaks louder than any thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, period-tinged, and mechanically precise: “brass ribs,” “valves hiss,” “diplomatically fierce.” Perceptual signature is Lysander’s—every noticed angle is a potential cipher or parry. No head-hopping; distance stays tight. Rhythm accelerates during blade exchanges without syntactic collapse, yielding a distinctive cadence that never slips into template.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—“the first clash rang like a cymbal” advances both sound and stake. Figurative language is spare, never ornamental; no mixed metaphors or filler loops. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each block advances tactic or revelation. Mechanical specificity (“punched holes framed sunlight”) is accurate and concise, propelling rather than pausing the duel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing fencing etiquette, steampunk prosthetics, and musical cartography feels inevitable here, not gimmicky. The hidden evacuation plan encoded in a half-painted sundial is a fresh conceit that reweights the city’s own anthem into lifesaving choreography. Risk is high—yet execution stays lucid, turning code-breaking into a swordfight without losing the reader. Specificity of the danish needle card and charcoal numerals anchors the novelty in tactile detail.</comment>
