<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sel’s interiority is vivid—astrolabe pressed to ear, tasting grit—but the “moonstruck dreamer” label is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown under pressure; choices feel pre-ordained by cosmic destiny rather than earned internal friction. Still, the embodied sensorium and final exhaustion carry a palpable cost, satisfying the 9- gate for short-form.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the spiral traced on birch becomes the key that rewrites the city’s calendar; cost is the bodily chill and the elders’ cracked astonishment. Causality holds—each meteor angle mechanically unlocks the vault—though the “rest until breath matches sky” beat is more lyric than causal. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence shift from hush to silver swarm reweights the stake; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The archway, astrolabe, and aurora are not backdrop but lock-and-key mechanics: the brass pointer’s tremor warms stone, the spiral on bark physically opens the seam. Micro-setting (instrument in hand) constrains the final gesture. Selective sensory hierarchy—taste of meteors, sour hush of confession—keeps description purposeful; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—tightens when Sel translates the elders’ sour hush and chooses to trace rather than fight. One meaningful deepening: third-night tremors escalate cold cost, foreclosing surrender. Agency is legible under Accumulative lens; pressure mounts via density of meteor lines, not external antagonist. Price is visible in shaking hands and elders’ cracked fear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of controlled imagination: stardust as censored memory. Final image—murals blooming—reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the elders’ silence translated as taste, not exposition. Ambiguity lingers: whose docility, whose fire? Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches Sel’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during aurora quiet, then fractures with meteor cuts, mirroring breath. Diction stays within dreamer-astronomer lexicon—“grit on the tongue,” “relieved throat”—creating a singular perceptual signature. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for aurora curtains, staccato fragments for meteor needles. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map, body, or sky. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—spiral, dust, calendar—paying off in final swarm. One mixed moment: “bruise of green fire” risks cliché, yet the bodily cost immediately grounds it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stolen star-memory as civic pacifier is fresh; the astrolabe-as-key reverses typical techno-magic. Lyric accumulation replaces causal showdown, a risk that pays off in image-driven reconfiguration. Specificity of “grit on tongue” and “unwritten calendar” prevents abstraction. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
