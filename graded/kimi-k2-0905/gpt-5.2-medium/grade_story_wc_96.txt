<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Len’s contradictory drives—anarchic planter vs. fragile poet—are dramatized in the coffee-tin micro-choices; the monthly personality molt is asserted more than embodied, but the final renunciation of burning the pamphlets carries visible cost, earning a credible shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two libraries mirror across the wall, seedlings and poems swapped, fracture accepted as bloom. Causal chain (smuggle-cart-seed-raid-sign) holds; only minor ellipsis between downtown break-in and first visitors, but the lens (Causal) stays intact and the cost—Len’s gentler June self afraid yet still planting—is on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rusted branch library’s bent ribs and starlit roof constrain every later choice; the coffee tin’s evolving contents (seeds→catalog) act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent: sirens braid birdsong, moonlight silvers the seeds—detail never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“forge beauty from anarchy before it swallows the city”—tightens when riots lock the prison and Len must decide whether to risk the roofless library; the choice to nail OPEN to the doorframe forecloses anonymity. Price is legible: soot-man, nurse, teen arrive, Len’s privacy and safety gone, pamphlets nearly burned—felt cost scales to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through mirrored libraries and seed-paper contraband: resistance germinates in shared reading, not slogans. No moralizing—final image of fracture blooming reweights the premise without dictating meaning, inviting counter-readings of complicity versus liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Len’s perceptual filter—“bright angles, as if light had cracked and learned to sing”—syntax tightens under riot sirens, then softens in June. No head-hopping; diction within plausible vagrant-poet lexicon; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propel without scaffold; figurative language disciplined—“sirens braid with birdsong” precise. No loops, no mixed metaphors; information density high—each line advances character, image, or stake. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of vagrant haiku-seller, monthly personality molt, and seed-smuggling poetry network feels singular; the roofless starlit library as reciprocal mirror to a locked prison library offers fresh spatial irony. Risky structure—mosaic shards across months—pays off in resonant closure, not gimmick.</comment>
