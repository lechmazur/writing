<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quietly defiant caretaker persona is vivid and embodied; her “brazen calm” under terminal news feels earned through tactile orchard work and diary precision. Interior contradiction surfaces when pain clashes with resolve while wiring oaks, showing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation—sharing the temple’s script rather than hoarding knowledge—pays visible cost as she yields center stage, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard keeps “translating” after her death, undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: diagnosis → remodel paths → communal vow → posthumous continuity. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—her finite breath while tying knots—shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<comment>Stone pillars sweating less after water rerouting is tactile proof of setting constraining outcome. Copper-wrapped oak arches function as micro-setting that gates goat/crane movement, charging closure image. Selective sensory hierarchy—lichen veins, rain channels—mirrors Mara’s caretaker gaze without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—species respect versus human interruption—tightens when Mara’s terminal clock forces physical remodel under pain. One meaningful deepening: discovery of seed-pod hollow reframes temple from sacred relic to nursery, narrowing options to redistribution. Cost legible in aching chest on ladder; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via distribution vs. hoarding: stone shares water, Mara shares script, orchard keeps translating. Subtext in crab silence beneath copper arches implies interspecies truce without statement. Final image of ongoing translation offers non-literal answer—belonging as continuous listening—avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—lichen warmth, fig/ant reciprocity—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for calm observation, clipped fragments during ladder pain. “Brazen calm” refrain modulates under pressure, sustaining tone while revealing fatigue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “copper wire…coax young limbs into arches” advances action, atmosphere, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse and precise. High information density with clean grammar; paragraph cuts tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: terminal caretaker rewires living temple to teach interspecies literacy. Stone-vein script and copper-guided oak arches feel inevitable yet unexampled. Risk—renouncing individual legacy for communal orchard—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
