<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—scavenger patience vs. savior urge—surface in the bolt-fixing micro-choice; the renunciation of “running circles” is earned and costs her the stored images. Interiority stays embodied (“dry taste”) and avoids label-speak. Ghost-as-mirror pressures her in-scene, satisfying crucible demand. Missing second on-page character keeps relationship bullet dormant; no penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses the restart fantasy and accepts custodial repairs; cost is the forfeiture of her image-archive and heroic identity. Causal lens holds—because she fixes the bolt, the horses settle and lagoon re-rotates; ghost payment is therefore/result. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by 80 words via stalled carousel & cloud-belly sound. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and camera-wheel function as micro-setting that constrains choice: water accepts story-currency, wheel extracts payment; both charge the final image. Sensory selection skews auditory/tactile (“click like gears,” “cloudlight is thin”) reflecting scavenger priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly beneath platform. Environment causally mirrors internal stasis without overt symbolism. Sufficient for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—negotiate peace with regret—signaled in first third. One meaningful tightening: payment of images narrows future options. Pressure coherent under causal lens; ghost demand escalates because Mara’s earlier negligence is made legible. Cost visible in eyelid-forfeiture sequence. No coincidence resolves. Sufficient for high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: maintenance over mastery, small honest repairs vs. grand salvation. Subtext carried in lagoon’s quiet rotation and the ghost’s triple nod—no moral stated. Final image of tending “small repairs” reweights earlier ambition without abstraction. Ambiguity lingers whether park or self is truly fixed. No final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinct scavenger idiom—“clouds rub their bellies,” “dry taste”—maintained under pressure. Compression (“yesterday arrives as a smell”) taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates from long spiral sentences to short final walk-off, mirroring acceptance. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “water looping…click like gears” shows motion and sounds simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language sparse outside taught pattern, avoiding purple drift. Strong verbs (“pinning,” “forfeiture”) replace modifiers. Closure image (“tend the small repairs”) crisp and uncluttered. Minor alliteration but not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—post-carousel ghost negotiation via story-currency—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if bolt-fix swapped out; specificity is high. Risk in chronology-mist and camera-wheel pays off by charging closure. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity maintained; park logic stays internally consistent.</comment>
