<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—trading her childhood to weigh a name—grounds every beat; the final renunciation of stolen names is earned and costs her identity mass. Embodied grief (“shame that feels newly polished”) stays specific, never label-speak. The only drag: Ellis appears late, so their status crucible is sketched rather than pressured in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: drip of Mara’s name → coin blooms → Ellis forced → body found → name restored. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighter tongue and glowing coin reweight the premise that names are currency. Cost is visible in the vial of Ellis’s sobbed name sealing the shroud. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rain-washed foundry is not backdrop: gutters spill silver water into slag heaps that Mara scoops to mix gold clay; the quench-pit reflection literally shows ORIN sinking, guiding her next move. Micro-setting (cracked cup ground into powder) constrains her alchemical budget. Every sensory pick is filtered through alchemical priorities; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem Orin’s name—tightens when the coin’s blank demands payment and Mara’s childhood loosens. One meaningful escalation: she realizes resurrection is impossible, downsizes goal to “smaller redemption,” and pays with stolen names. Price is legible on-page: tongue “honest and raw,” vial heavy with Ellis’s name. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—names as measurable, spendable substance—emerges through action, not thesis: cracked scales, coin drinking names, tongue raw. Kintsugi motif stays implicit in gold-flecked clay and repaired cup; final glowing inlay reweights “mending” as moral restitution. No moralizing; the image of the lighter tongue and sunrise coin invites counter-readings about erasure vs. restitution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person alchemical voice is distinct: syntax balances ledger-like precision (“measure of my name”) with sensorial shimmer (“grief itself were luminous”). Perceptual signature—everything noticed for weight, distillability—never slips. Compression (“my childhood loosen”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal modulation under stress is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chains (“silver water,” “luminous regret”) stay coherent. One strained image—“missing tooth” for coin blank—momentarily trips the physical logic of a flat face. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, and the final line lands without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The name-as-currency premise feels fresh, and kintsugi translated into alchemical restitution is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk: refusing resurrection and opting for nominal restitution could feel anticlimactic, yet the down-shift is earned and reweights genre expectations. Specificity of alchemical practice prevents template drift; story would collapse if names were merely metaphorical.</comment>
