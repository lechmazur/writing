<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interior contradiction—body as poem yet weaponized chastity—drives every micro-choice; the sister-echo memory converts stillness into motive force. The final bow crystallizes a new bodily grammar, cost paid in the governor’s hollowed voice. One beat of label-speak (“alarming serenity was her shield”) keeps her from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: each thread-untangle tightens risk until the breath-lock reverses power. Closure lands as Decisive Change—echoes scatter, obedience fractures—cost legible in the orchestra’s falter. Lens holds from salt-snow opening to starlit exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, glass chapel, and snow form a micro-setting that actively resists and records sound; the prisms’ “calm knives” refract both light and stakes. Final image of syllables “scattering into the snow” reweights the entire space. One extra adjective (“quiet of sifted salt”) barely blunts the edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the city’s voice—tightens with every unraveled thread; the sister’s pledge provides visceral fuel. Escalation is linear and irreversible: each memory-voice loosed raises personal cost until the governor’s grip audibly hollows. No fallback or deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed consent emerges through echo-metaphor rather than thesis; the lullaby-break is felt when guests hear their own softer doubts returned. Final scatter of vows offers a resonant, non-moral answer: choice re-enters the world. No closing sermon, only snow and many melodies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maris’s perceptual filter—breath, posture, silk knot—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under tension then snaps short at release, mirroring untangling action. One clause (“because refusal would have rung too loud”) edges toward explanation, not embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without clog; “starlight fractured into calm knives” concentrates scene, threat, and beauty. Rhythm modulates from processional opening to staccato release. A single scaffold phrase (“as courtesans do”) repeats intent already shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Harvest of echoes” weaponizes memory itself—a fresh socio-magical instrument that feels ancient yet newly cruel. Bodily poetics as lockpick fuses erotic discipline with political sabotage, inseparable from this tale. Risky crystalline chapel could have slid into gimmick; instead it refracts stakes literally. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
