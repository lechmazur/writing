<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory drives—guilt-driven truth-telling versus self-preservation through art—are dramatized in every beat; the final renunciation of color vision costs her the very perceptual weapon she wielded, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “rainbows trembling on bone”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to fracture the killer’s name across three stanzas crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Only the guard’s switch from duty to complicity feels slightly under-motivated, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s deliberate surrender of art and color refracts the truth permanently through the canyon’s echoes, paying the “price of forgiveness” on the page. Causal chain holds: because she hides the murder in laughter, she must scatter the name; because she scatters it, the canyon amplifies it; because amplification succeeds, she forfeits her medium. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and remain stable. One minor scaffold—”the crowd took up the lines” repeats the prior beat’s effect—does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pale spire and bone towers are not backdrop; they are acoustic tools that literally refract sound and light, enabling Mara’s tactic and the final rainbow strike that exposes the killer. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, lantern circle, spire base, heel-crush exit all track without drift. Sensory selection skews to echo and refracted color, mirroring Mara’s painterly perception. Environment constrains the only possible confession—whispered poetry that the canyon returns as chorus—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the truth escape alive”—tightens when each poetic fragment forecloses silence further; the killer’s lunge is the final external escalation. Agency is continuous: doodle bribe, stanza dispersal, prism placement, ink sacrifice each narrow options under causal logic. Cost accrues visibly: first social risk (banishment), then physical (loss of color), last existential (loss of art). One slight softening: the killer’s capture relies on crowd momentum more than Mara’s final act, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of the elders’ axiom: forgiveness is not purchased by surrendering what you love, but by surrendering what you love to the community’s shared memory—truth refracted becomes collective immunity. Subtext lives in gesture: antler doodle signals Jalen’s complicity before he speaks; rainbow shards on bone foreshadow the price. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of monochrome fingers on white bone reweights every prior color reference. Complexity lingers: the killer is caught, yet Mara’s world is permanently bleached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Mara’s painterly synesthesia—”rainbows trembling,” “ink breathing”—creating a perceptual signature that collapses into grayscale at cost. Rhythm accelerates into short, reed-bent lines during poetry dispersal, then fractures into staccato beats at the heel-crush. No head-hopping; Jalen’s interiority is implied only through antlered snort and catching arm. Compression (“she poured her ink… cracked each prism”) is taught early by prism-light play and pays off in the final monochrome moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the canyon air turned every whisper into a thousand answers” simultaneously world-builds and foreshadows tactic. Figurative language is selective, never stacked; mixed metaphors are avoided. One filter-verb cluster (“she began impromptu poetry sessions”) is strategically placed to slow tempo before the scattering beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long inhalation of opening to shard-like final exhalation without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise flips the familiar “art as confession” into “confession as anti-art”: Mara weaponizes dispersion, then sacrifices perception itself—an inversion rarely seen. Bone towers functioning as acoustic prisms is a world-specific invention that cannot be relocated without breaking logic. Risk is high—lyric montage in under 800 words—yet coherence holds. The final monochrome sting feels inevitable yet unforeseeable, fulfilling the transformation test.</comment>
