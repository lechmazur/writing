<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s obsession with “the sound of approaching endings” is embodied in the bone-tip taps and the midnight crawl to free the skiff; contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—co-exist in scene. The renunciation Signe demands lands as earned stasis: he foregoes further voyeuristic pursuit and accepts the fold in patience, cost visible in the final image of sled receding into wind. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: the grandmother fire memory is summoned twice in similar language, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist lets the ending pass, crystallizing a new stance under Accumulative/Textural lens—ice pops, breath, wind-borne words reweight earlier pattern. Causality holds: each shard (tap, storm, cut, dawn) accrues density until the final refusal. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the image of the sled disappearing into the fold of patience—an irrevocable foregone path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but tool: pontoon planks, tarps, slewing skiff constrain every crawl and cut. Wind and ice pops supply both sensory narrowness and thematic metronome. The bone parasol tip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when last tapped then pocketed. One minor over-adjective moment (“needles of ice”) but environment never stalls action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of endings”—tightens through tactile trials: each tap, the storm, the cut netting, the dawn relinquishment. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accretive. One meaningful deepening at the storm beat narrows options: risk life to keep the clinic path open, then choose to relinquish pursuit. Cost is felt in the final letting-go; could wish for one earlier tangible loss (tool, injury) to sharpen tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: listening as both mercy and voyeurism, endings as weather to witness rather than seize. Subtext lives in gesture—hand rising “before I decided,” bone tip clenched in teeth—never explained. Final image reweights prior taps into acceptance without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; wisdom is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic metal-taste, time-fold, ice resonance. Compression (“my thoughts slid away as if my skull had lost its latch”) teaches pattern early and holds. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly. One clause drifts slightly above lexicon—“conceptual repricing” risk in “study of approaching endings”—but remains in character’s self-coinage.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, selective, never muddles causality. Information density high: “wind moved constantly there, not hostile, just tireless” does three jobs in ten words. Zero paraphrase loops; only micro-repeat is “fold in patience” twice, justified as motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Euthanasia tourist” reframed as acoustic pilgrim; disaster-relief ice marina fresh; bone parasol tip as stethoscope for mortality—synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric time-fold structure pays off in closure image. No derivative echoes; concept commits fully without retreat. Specificity of Icelandic drift-ice logistics grounds the abstract premise.</comment>
