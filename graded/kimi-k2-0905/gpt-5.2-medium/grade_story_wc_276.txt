<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rovan’s calm, zig-zag rationality and the embodied ache in his ribs give a credible, contradictory pulse; the final renunciation of the spike is earned. Yet his interiority rarely surprises—cool-headed stays cool, no crack of panic or ego to complicate the choice. Mera is off-stage, so relationship crucible and status shifts are moot. Still, the micro-choice to seal the echo inside himself carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the rail spike’s plunge seals both echo and warning, reweighting the garden’s rule-set while costing Rovan his tool and his lullaby. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each zig-zag and voiced silence thickens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the elders’ prophecy is told, not tested, but it doesn’t resolve the conflict, so the beat survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass reeds, star-dragging sky, and vibrating vines are sensuous, selective, and filtered through Rovan’s fisher priorities. The rail spike as micro-setting constrains the final act—its polished memory of straight tracks determines how the echo is pinned—clear 9+ gate pass. Spatial choreography across the zig-zag path and pool-edge remains coherent. Only the ponds’ staff-line ripples flirt with over-decoration, but the image is brief and tied to the sonic stakes, so no cap triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—tightens through each refusal to march straight; the quietest harmonic becomes the only viable path, foreclosing louder options. Agency is exercised in the final spike-sacrifice, paying a visible tool-cost. Pressure escalates by density: constellations snag, harmonics overlap, silence thickens into static figure. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope and lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patterns must stay breakable to remain free. The feral lullaby image reweights this without sermon—no character states the thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: zig-zag as anti-prediction, silence as bait. The echo’s teeth linger as ambiguous warning, inviting counter-readings; no tidy moral imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Rovan’s cool, rhythmic perception; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under harmonic assault—prose as character. Diction stays within fisher-craft lexicon; “rail spike remembered straight tracks” is idiomatic and charged. One minor filter verb cluster (“he understood then”) but it occurs post-climax and doesn’t contaminate the peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield: “silence thickened into a figure” does double duty for atmosphere and plot. One paraphrase loop—“patterns break themselves” repeated twice in 30 words—drops the score a hair. Otherwise clean grammar, precise verbs, zero scaffolding; the final line breathes with propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sonic ecology plus sleepwalking constellations fused with fisher-spike tech feels genuinely new; no trope checklist. The risk of “music as water” could have drowned in abstraction, but concrete tool-use and zig-zag tactic ground it. Conceptual payoff—the echo as anti-tyrant protocol—grows inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test fails if relocated: the rail spike’s industrial memory is irreplaceable.</comment>
