<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apprentice-thief’s motive to “amend my last failure” is concrete and personal, and the micro-choice to let go of the railing crystallizes the interior contradiction between self-preservation and sacred playfulness. Embodied emotion stays specific—sundial lid “warm as a pulse,” knees on ice—never sliding into label-speak. Status shift with Serren is legible but compressed into a single laugh-line; a hair more cost to the narrator’s body or identity would push this to 9+. No causality break; the final leap is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (swap bishop → whisper → climb → let go) is a because/therefore chain that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change: the sky steadies, chains loosen, map opens—cost is the literal fall and the unknown flight path now binding them. Orientation is taught by sentence 3 (“icebound spire above the clouds”) and anchors hold. One micro-turn—pawn to bishop swap—carries the entire plot; no redundancy or soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ice cathedral, bone chessboard, and the sundial lid as micro-setting all constrain tactics: the swap must be exact, the lid must open mid-storm. Sensory hierarchy obeys thief’s lock-pick attention: weight of pieces, temperature of metal, wind vector against ledge. “Wrong sky” rule is shown through tilted horizon and wet-brush clouds, never exposited. Spatial choreography across the chapel-to-ledge traverse tracks cleanly; the spire itself re-enters the final image as the launch rail for the map-route, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“steal the truth and leave without breaking a single promise”—tightens into “steal tomorrow” once the sky-route map appears. Escalation is causal: each swapped piece raises risk of detection, leading to the alarm-cord moment that forces the protagonist to choose chivalry over stealth. Price is immediate: flask spent, guard downed, body airborne; future cost is the uncharted airway whose rules they must now learn or die. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “cautious abandon” emerges through the chess swap and the final step-off: prudence and rashness braided, not balanced. Sacred playfulness is tested under literal chains; the joke is that the only key is letting go. No final-paragraph thesis—resonance sits in the open lid and warming circle of light that reweights the earlier “courage not time” claim. Ambiguity lingers: they may be thieves of tomorrow or its first casualties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a lute-string cadence—long sentences that tighten into fragments at the leap (“let go of the railing, and trusted…”). Diction stays thief-precise: “studied their keys,” “cipher altar,” no academic drift. Compression (“I apologized for the inconvenience”) teaches the chivalric-comic pattern early and pays it off when the guard is laid out “like a sleeping guard.” No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent under storm stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside as neatly as prayer beads” advances plot, image, and simile in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the ice-and-sky motif without contradiction. One near-purple line—“sky churned, as if someone were repainting it with a wet brush”—is justified by POV’s painterly thief-eye. Rhythm accelerates into short beats at the ledge, then opens into the final glide; zero scaffolding touches the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The ice-spire chess-heist fusion feels inevitable yet fresh: caper logic grafted onto celestial clockwork. Bone-cipher board and “map that exists only when the sky goes wrong” are specific inventions, not window dressing. Risk is structural—entire plot hinges on a single pawn-to-bishop swap—yet payoff lands. Transformation test fails if names change; the voice, mechanic, and theme are inseparable. Slight deduction for echoing familiar “leap of faith” trope, but the sundial-courage reprice rescues it.</comment>
