<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jonas’s interiority is textured through limestone-stained hands and the private “throb” of his question, but the spectral father’s instruction bypasses his own contradiction; the final communal braiding is moving yet feels guided rather than wrested from inner conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon-tying beats braid separate losses into a visible pattern that peaks when siblings add their colors to the unfinished tablet, creating a Charged Poise with communal cost; causality is loose but coherence and closure land cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass sweating after heat, vines swallowing benches, butterfly weight trembling ribbons—each detail is filtered through Jonas’s carver-eye and finally constrains the memorial design; the dusk river flats remain slightly generic, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes—finding the shape of shared grief—tighten as ribbons move from single stones to clusters; the spectral mentor accelerates pattern recognition but lessens protagonist-driven pressure, so the final communal chord feels earned yet slightly gift-wrapped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete ritual of ribbon and chisel: private mourning becomes communal fabric; no moral is stated, yet the final map of “shared pauses” reweights every earlier headstone rubbing with understated social cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Jonas’s perceptual filter—limestone dust, metered breath, carver’s notice of chisel hesitation; syntax slows and thickens like wet clay, then lifts in the final image, maintaining rhythmic control without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—“orange wings drifted over the glass like embers” does triple sensory work; occasional soft repeats (“thundering calm”) are pattern-taught and payoff in the final line, so artifacts never dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The butterfly-ribbon-stone conjunction feels inevitable in hindsight; spectral mentorship risks trope, but the translation of family poem recitals into communal ribbon ritual gives the piece a quiet, non-obvious angle on cemetery grief.</comment>
