<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Haru’s studious precision, paste-scented hands, and need to “collect textures of time” are concrete and particular; his micro-choice to climb the mountain with the notepad externalizes the internal drive. The final act—folding the notepad away—caps his arc with earned stasis: he accepts silence yet retains agency over time’s naming. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping him just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Haru’s descent with “cataloged sensations” reweights silence from loss to portable archive. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each charted hum layers a new invented history until the bonsai garden refracts the pattern into charged poise. Cost is legible in the final image: he carries the burden of naming time alone. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fluorescent hum, cedar shavings, and lantern-moss bonsai are tactile constraints that shape Haru’s method and final insight. The maintenance-shed bulb literalizes the “indoor time” he must transcend; the lightning-scarred oak embodies silence as “pause waiting to be scored.” Environment directly governs his ability to chart and refract, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving time’s texture against erasure—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when indoor hum proves “thin,” forcing the trek to the bonsai labyrinth; there, leaf-rustle deepens the pattern and refracts riskier histories. The tightening narrows options: accept mute streets or carry named sensations. Cost is felt in solitary descent, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory as active composition rather than rescue. Invented histories are not lies but ethical reconstructions, a stance complicated by the bonsai scale that demands tactile truth. Final image—cataloged sensations in coat—reweights silence as collaborative canvas, avoiding moral statement. Subtext of craft-as-survival is earned through sensory labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Haru’s perceptual signature: gold leaf “without shouting,” minutes with “prisms hidden inside.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with hum cadence; diction remains within stationer’s lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Final sentence’s quiet trochaic fall mirrors incandescent restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“pages pressed together,” “incandescent restraint”—and avoids clutter in peak beats. One paraphrase loop (“charted the faint hum…at dawn”) repeats verbatim; minor but keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—time cartography via fluorescent hum—feels fresh yet inevitable. Bonsai labyrinth as temporal instrument reframes familiar post-apocalyptic silence into intimate craft. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the final cataloged sensations synthesize sound, botany, and metallurgy without gimmickry. Specificity of stationer’s trade prevents generic swap.</comment>
