<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to certainty while courting curiosity—are dramatized in the solvent-freezing moment; the final “I do not know yet” is earned by the looping awakenings that force her to relinquish control. Interiority stays concrete (echo-counting, coin-tapping) and the embodied cost is visible when the brush halts mid-stroke. The only minor slip is Tomas functioning more as acoustic mirror than full crucible, but the story’s drive is her self-interrogation, so relationship pressure is not required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s refusal to finish is a Charged Poise that reweights the entire premise—curiosity now trumps certainty, and the cost is the perpetual loop of awakening. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; each echo-folding beat increases density until the final image of mirrored singers reflecting ever-smaller Maras crystallizes the stake. Causality holds: every awakening is triggered by her own sonic choice, so the ellipsis is motivated. Orientation is taught early (amphitheater, garden, mural) and the disorientation is functional, paying off in the nested structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: sine hedges and comma pools dictate brush timing and coin placement, directly constraining her tactical choices. Micro-setting (nickel-sized pinhole) functions as pivot; its fit with the coin charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—Mara notices pitch, echo decay, solvent smell—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: every clap, tap, and footstep is traceable across the garden geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when she halts the forbidden mid-stroke; that single choice forecloses the “right” restoration and locks her into recursive uncertainty. Pressure escalates through each echo-loop; the cost is cumulative disorientation and the perpetual deferral of completion. No external antagonist is needed; the wall’s resistance is her own perfectionism reflected back. Coincidence is absent; every fold is triggered by her sonic agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the looping structure itself: knowledge is not a layer to be stripped but a mirror that multiplies. The hobo nickel’s ear-icon and the singers’ mouth-shapes of Tomas’s question embody the idea that inquiry listens and reflects rather than extracts. Final image of unpainted mirror-eyes reweights the premise: the mural gazes back, forcing curator to become specimen. No moral is stated; the resonance is in the infinite regress of attention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—sound is directional, color “seeps,” solvent “softens only what was false.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with echo duration, creating rhythmic mimicry. No head-hopping; Tomas’s interior is never trespassed. The lyric elision (“she woke again inside the previous awakening”) is taught early and remains legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “echo did not just bounce—it folded” does double duty as physics and psyche. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is patterned (sound as map, coin as key) and pays off in closure. One hairline slip—“bright with possibilities” skirts cliché—but the final line’s open vowels echo the garden’s resonance, redeeming the moment.</comment>

<comment>The sonic-mosaic structure is fresh: a restoration tale that dissolves the artifact instead of completing it. Nested awakenings invert the standard “last layer” trope, making the restorer the final varnish. Risk—using recursive dream-logic in under 800 words—heightens coherence rather than obscures it. Specificity of tuned stones and comma-pools anchors the experiment in tactile reality, preventing gimmickry.</comment>
