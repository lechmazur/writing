<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting to read belonging yet fearing attachment—surfaces in her micro-choice to loosen the clamps; Jonah’s bolt-counting loneliness turns when he cups the lantern. Both arcs earn their shared exhale, but the final “beat in time” drifts toward label-speak, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the algae-lit feather and spiraling fireflies reconfigure “belonging” from solitary reading to joint pointing. Causal chain holds—because Mira opens the terrarium, Jonah’s isolation loosens, and sunrise becomes boundary not sentence. Cost is legible in the unspoken risk of staying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass corridors, cracked dome, and drifting jellies are filtered through Mira’s chart-reading gaze; every sensory note constrains movement or mood. The terrarium’s dry moss and rusted clamps physically resist opening, charging the final release. Micro-setting mastery keeps the piece at high-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“one night to see what rhythms still live”—tightens when the clamp twist risks flooding the last breathable pocket. Sunrise clock and shared lantern escalate under Accumulative lens; the green loops re-weight loneliness vs. connection with visible price. One additional tightening beat mid-ascent would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of co-authored constellations emerges through image, not thesis: feather-as-needle, algae-as-zodiac, fireflies-as-shared-sky. Final dome-image re-prices “belonging” without moralizing. Minor sentimental haze around “beat in time” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s synesthetic perception; diction of “shadowseam,” “algae-zodiac,” and “slow thoughts” creates a distinct texture. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under dome pressure. Dialogue is sparse but idiom-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary from short percussion (“She tapped walls”) to lyric spiral (“fireflies…in gentle green loops”). No scaffold loops; only one mixed metaphor (“moving stars of reflected streetlights”) barely grazes clarity. High density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Landscape-astrology as emotional sonar feels fresh; underwater terrarium of dormant fireflies is an image I haven’t seen. The synthesis of tidal charts with orphaned bioluminescence turns loneliness into shared cartography without gimmick. Risk pays off.</comment>
