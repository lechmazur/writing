<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s storm-recorder meticulousness is dramatized in every beat—note-taking under surveillance, reading wind off roofs—so when he chooses lateral flight over direct confrontation the decision is trait-rooted and costly (Mara’s raw wrists, his own hunted future). Interiority stays concrete: “my stomach measured it as fraud.” The final note-book promise shows earned endurance, not epiphany, with solitude now elected, not imposed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: pigeon note → quarantine discovery → lateral infiltration → data-airlift escape → watcher misled. Each because/therefore link narrows options; the unlatched gate loops back to payoff. Closure is a Charged Poise: the courtyard hush regained but now shared with Mara and the knowledge that data can outrun fences—cost felt in the continuing silhouette outside.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jasmine, rain barrels, lantern-short light, and chlorine-rot grain create an olfactory-visual scorecard that guides stealth: the courtyard calm vs. warehouse stench signals hidden danger. Rooftop wind shifts and waterline crate-gap are tactile way-finding tools, not postcard filler. The pigeon’s reprise at the end recharges the opening hush, making the courtyard itself a contested instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity of data vs. state falsification—tightens when the narrator’s name appears on an illegal list; every lateral move (wall hops, river slither) raises exposure. The chlorine-disinfectant scene forces a visceral trade-off: inhale evidence or flee; he stays, copies logs, pays with delayed sirens. Cost is on-page and persistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—truth as a lateral, quiet insurgency—emerges through action, not sermon: storm data smuggled by bird, integrity re-defined as collective act with Mara. Final image of the still-watched gate reframes solitude from cage to chosen weapon, leaving ambiguity about future storms. No moralizing, only charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a meteorologist’s perceptual signature—barometer-ticking breath, wind-shift literacy—without ever slipping into data-dump. Syntax lengthens for stealth tension, then compresses during crate-slide. No head-hop; the single micro-shift into Mara’s whisper is brief, motivated, and immediately re-anchored to narrator’s ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “chlorine mixed with rotting grain, a layered tranquility that tried to pass as safety” advances smell, irony, and theme in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each image new, specific, propulsive. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator-appropriate; no mixed metaphors or drum-beat cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The storm-recorder turned whistle-blower is fresh, but the rogue-quarantine trope is familiar; however, the lateral-move methodology, pigeon-data courier, and jasmine courtyard re-animate it with sensory precision. The quiet ending refusal of heroic spectacle feels risk-bought and story-specific. Transformation passes the “different names” test: the arc would collapse without this exact narrator’s instruments and choices.</comment>
