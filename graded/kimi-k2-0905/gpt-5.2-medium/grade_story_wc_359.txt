<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s synesthetic perception is vividly embodied and drives every micro-choice; the moment he strikes the bells to “unfetter” Maera’s voice is a concrete, costly act that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—duty to the Guild versus loyalty to wonder—and the final public performance shows earned endurance with the city’s fragile charter as visible cost. Only the Council weeping feels slightly performative; the emotional price is otherwise legible and scaled to the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber sheet darkens, the hush is re-sculpted into permission, and the decree’s fragility is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—each chisel strike tightens the silence, forcing Lio’s counter-music—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words by ice, lantern, and Guild mission. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; the sheet’s final darkening is set up by its earlier glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its stalactites become harmonic resonators, the aurora’s colors are tasted and played, and the sculpted hush is literally carved from the walls. Micro-setting—the marble block—serves as altar and amplifier, constraining where the sheet must be laid. Spatial choreography is clean: bodies, bells, and echoes track without drift. Environment plus tool (prism bells) jointly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wonder versus rationed silence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when silence becomes a prison that swallows Maera’s breath. One meaningful escalation: the hush clenches, Lio must risk Guild censure to play the forbidden scale. Cost is visible—the sheet’s darkening, the city’s brittle charter—and the choice to keep ringing at the end forecloses quietude as imposed control. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absence can be art yet becomes weaponized control; wonder is an unruly civic good that cannot be taxed. Subtext lives in gesture—Maera’s silent mouth, the sheet swallowing fireflies—never in thesis statements. Final image of Lio ringing both lullaby and warning reweights the premise without moralizing. Only the phrase “wonder cannot be taxed away” flirts with echo-language, but it is embedded in dramatized testimony, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lio’s synesthetic idiom—tasting brass, hearing greens—creates a consistent perceptual signature that modulates under stress: short, chiming clauses when the hush clenches, longer aurora-lit sentences during release. No head-hopping; distance remains tight first-person. Prose rhythm mirrors bell sequence: controlled, iterative, then blooming. Occasional elevated diction (“oscillating repose”) is justified by the guild-artist POV and does not drift into corporate register.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, sound, motion—without scaffold: “the hush loosens as if it had joints” collapses abstract silence into tactile anatomy. Figurative density is high yet patterned; aurora colors return as chords, preventing metaphor sprawl. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. A single near-cliché (“ice over deep water”) is earned by prior ice imagery and does not dull the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, sculptable silence, and taxable wonder feels non-obvious yet inevitable; remove any pillar and the story collapses. Risk is high—lyric accumulative structure could have drifted into tableau—but the bell-scale payoff reconfigures prior material without late rule changes. Specific detail (amber sheet darkening like resin swallowing fireflies) anchors abstraction in sensory singularity. The premise commits fully; no retreat into generic dystopia.</comment>
