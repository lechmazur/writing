<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—scientist’s detachment vs. covert empathy—surface in the arrowhead moment; her decision to plant it is earned by prior tactile unease and Edda’s charge. Jonas’s shift from haunted to willing punch-line is legible through embodied cost (sweat, ordinary weight). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that Mara’s professional bitterness is asserted more than dramatized before the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Jonas reweights the Choir’s pull by offering bitterness-as-joke, gravity settles, cost is felt in the hush after the chord. Causal chain (arrowhead → grounded stitch, phone → conduit, Jonas’s speech → repricing) holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“town of Larkspur… underground garden”). Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final reconfiguration. One hairline slip: the taped-antenna phone is introduced mid-stream yet becomes the decisive conduit—minor but prevents perfect 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underground garden’s iron-honey air and uphill-sliding pots physically constrain the climax; the arrowhead’s hum and final planting charge the closure image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (researcher notices knapping, herbalist notes rue). Spatial choreography is immaculate across the single scene. Micro-setting doubles as gravitational apparatus—irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep Jonas human—signals early and tightens when Mara plants the arrowhead, foreclosing the Choir’s doorway option. Escalation is causal: each confession increases gravitational play until the final trade-off. Price is visible (shadow peels, gravity hiccups, Jonas sweats). Could use one earlier tangible loss (e.g., a plant dies) to push into 9+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief converted into cosmic laughter as refusal to disappear—emerges through Jonas’s offered punchline, not exposition. The arrowhead’s reprise reweights “pinning the world” as collaborative act. Subtext in phone confessions carries more menace than any stated threat. Final image of Jonas keeping the phone crystallizes the wager without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a researcher's precision edged with lyric hunger; perceptual signature is consistent (valerian = data, flint = anomaly). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses under garden lull, staccato beats during gravity hiccup. No head-hopping; Edda’s dialogue stays terse, Jonas’s diction skews aphoristic without converging with narrator. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do dual work (action + atmosphere) with almost no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: “gravity learned to smile” is taught by sliding pots and paid off. One mixed image—“laugh that never reached his mouth”—is forgiven because the final line redeems it. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift; final line lands with crystalline punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of cryptid academia, gravitational music, and herbalist mysticism feels inevitable, not stitched. The “Pulling Choir” reframes siren lore through physics-of-grief. Arrowhead-as-stitch inverts colonial artifact trope into indigenous tech of anchoring. Risk—using lyric first-person inside speculative horror—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
