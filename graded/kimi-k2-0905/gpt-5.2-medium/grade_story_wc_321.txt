<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s practiced optimism is shown through tactile ritual (double-checking lines, whistling) and undercut by the ache of every gangway goodbye; the final choice to merge timelines is foreshadowed by her need to keep commuters from vanishing alone. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels as permanent transient as the tide”—and the mirrored nod with older-Lina crystallizes cost without sentimentality. The only drag is a hairline slip into diagnostic self-labeling (“her real motivation was…”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two ferries touch, commuters breathe, and a persistent constraint—the seam now held by ongoing pattern-work—remains legible. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the sideways clocks and empty hourglass set up the rule, the radio code executes it, and the nod between Linas reconfigures meaning with felt cost (they must keep working the seam). No teleporting props or retro-patches; the hourglass’s weight and the grotto’s shimmer are earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Alder Strait, grotto, and ferry deck are filtered through Lina’s professional eye—she notices rope lattice, engine pitch, tide height—so every sensory pick anchors choice. The grotto’s “blue salt light” and hovering hull constrain the final merge; the star-chart pinned above the radio literally guides the code she transmits. Environment, tool, and body interlock to charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing solitary disappearance—surfaces early and tightens when Lina realizes the ferry is “sliding” between timelines. One decisive escalation: she abandons going home, steers alone toward the feared grotto, and risks becoming the next frozen commuter. Cost is visible—she trades her own year of life/experience to older-Lina and accepts perpetual maintenance of the seam.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring image of parallel routes—knots, star charts, ferry tracks—asking whether connection can outwit erasure. The final nod between selves reframes resilience as collaborative upkeep rather than solo optimism, reweighting earlier whistling without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: commuters laugh at an unexplainable delay, unaware of the labor that keeps them real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lina’s perceptual signature: fog makes city lights “look like they were slipping,” engines “sound as if they were turning pages.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with tide-rhythm; no head-hop even when older-Lina speaks through the batteryless radio, keeping psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “water…arranged itself into interconnected patterns…like the hourglass engraving made liquid” does triple sensory, metaphoric, and causal duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. A single strained simile—“smelled of coffee, hearing footsteps that were not there”—is momentarily ghost-cliché but does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-ferry trope is inverted into a seam that demands continuous maintenance rather than a one-off rescue. Pattern-as-stitching (routes, knots, star charts) synthesizes maritime labor with quantum folklore, making the mundane toolset the magic. Risky structural doubling pays off: the older-Lina encounter could have collapsed into self-help symmetry, but the workman’s nod reframes it as shared custodianship—fresh, specific, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
