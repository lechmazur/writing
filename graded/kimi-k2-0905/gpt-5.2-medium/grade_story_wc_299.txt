<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"wrest meaning from it the way I used to wrest a road case" marries muscle memory to grief. The micro-choice to draft the report that recommends a listening station crystallizes the shift from fact-armor to gift-giving. Cost is felt: he forfeits the safety of being right in order to make someone else’s memory real. One hairline slip: the final realization is articulated rather than dramatized, blunting the last ounce of sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: televised humiliation → flight → quarry inventory → grille cloth → memory → report → shared solace. The trailer window looking “down into the scar of stone” anchors orientation inside 120 words and later reappears as the literal throat that holds their voices. Closure is Earned Stasis: he doesn’t get applause back; he gives the cloth’s story away and accepts the quieter wage of usefulness. Cost is on-page—"I did not hide behind jargon"—and the constraint (no more public acclaim) persists.</comment>

<comment>The quarry’s “scar of stone” and the trailer’s “thin walls humming when trucks rolled by” are tactile, acoustic, and fate-shaping: the valley’s echo demands the listening-station idea. The grille cloth micro-setting acts as mobile environment—its tear and silver thread constrain the dating beats and final gift. Weather (rain-scented tarp) and spatial choreography (pinning cloth to corkboard above inventory photos) track cleanly. No description is tourism; each detail is filtered through roadie-trained eyes that measure weave the way he once taped cables.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he trade being right for being useful—tightens when the cloth’s possible link to the dead singer emerges. The single reversal: from cataloguing for self-protection to curating for Marla’s grief. Pressure escalates because each fact he records now threatens to expose his own hollowed purpose. The cost is visible: relinquishing expert distance to admit the cloth might be the brother’s “first thing that felt like him.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: purpose is not the roar but the hush afterward when you hand someone proof their memory is real. Subtext lives in objects—grille cloth carries the singer’s terror of silence, now transferred to Marla. No moralizing; the final line lets the valley’s stone throat literalize the idea. The report’s recommendation (listening station) is the non-literal answer: amplify absence instead of filling it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries roadie cadence—technical nouns, cable metaphors, rhythmic anaphora ("I measured...I listed...I wrote"). Compression is taught early: "facts felt like earplugs" cues the reader to accept later ellipses. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent—sound memory overrides visual whenever stress peaks. Dialogue is minimal but idiomatic: Marla’s shrugged "nothing left to steal out here, only echoes" sounds like quarry foreman shorthand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from lean inventory beats to elongated grief coils without losing propulsion. Figurative control: "the valley holding our voices in its stone throat" is the single extended metaphor and it pays off at closure. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. One near-slip: "confidently uncertain nods" is a label pair that could feel workshop-cute, but the next sentence grounds it in physical memory of giving the same nod to sound engineers, so it earns its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antiques road-show crash with quarry archaeology feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The grille cloth as relic of both rock show and personal loss transforms a trope into specific grief technology. Risk taken: quiet ending that refuses restored fame, choosing custodianship instead—coherent with the story’s rejection of applause economics. Could not swap quarry for mall parking lot without breaking the echo logic that powers the listening-station idea.</comment>
