<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theo’s guilt-earned paralysis and micro-choices (poles, compass, logbook) track cleanly; the final renunciation carries felt cost. Interiority sometimes drifts into tidy self-explanation (“he realized he did not need the sea to absolve him”) that momentarily flattens contradiction. Still, contradictory impulses (flee vs. face, shame vs. service) stay active in-scene enough to earn the 8-band edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: cancelled ferry → inland paddle → pole navigation → logbook confession; each beat forecloses prior evasions. Closure lands as Decisive Change with social cost: public admission in indelible ink. One minor causality bobble—Lita’s roadside sprint keeps pace with a kayak in open water—doesn’t dent the core chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Coastline, weather, and pole numbers root the reader quickly; kayak motion and damp ramp give tactile ingress. Utility-pole micro-setting directly steers every tactical choice and charges the final image. One brief white-room patch inside the museum corridor is instantly offset by the logbook’s tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he keep hiding or confess—tightens each time he commits to the next pole; logbook entry crystallizes the price. No external antagonist needed: backlash of memory supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is linear, not exponential, capping the score just below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-forgiveness through service emerges via poles-as-stars substitution and the compass-as-confession image; no moralizing summary required. Final image of “wet pencils” reweights earlier navigation motif without literal statement. Some phrasing (“people were more than their worst day”) flirts with platitude but is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Theo’s perceptual filter; syntax mirrors his mordant, lyrical tilt. Occasional elevated diction (“gravitate toward tomorrow”) feels authored rather than lived, a hairline slip. Rhythm modulates with paddle cadence and squall tension, supporting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density: most sentences layer motion, sensory cue, and metaphor without clog. Mixed metaphor cluster (“wet paper tears,” “salt in a cut,” “backlash”) in the same early paragraph mildly dilutes precision. No loops or scaffold survive; final third stays clean, keeping 8-band within reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Navigation-by-utility-pole is a fresh inversion of star-reading; inland penance paddle reconfigures familiar redemption arc. Specific coastal minutiae (eelgrass edge, pole numbers) prevent template drift. Concept doesn’t revolutionize the genre but delivers a memorable, grounded inflection.</comment>
