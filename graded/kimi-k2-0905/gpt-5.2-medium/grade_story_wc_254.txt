<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s hunger to dissolve the boundary between living and dead is visceral and textually embodied; her paraphrase habit is a concrete micro-choice that alters the guards’ compliance and later softens the colonnade itself. The brother-loss motive is anchored early and drives every step; the final renunciation—walking forward until both selves become air—carries visible cost (Soren’s hand passing through cloth). Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens; no stock grief labels. Only the “aesthetically driven” trait remains slightly ornamental, never forcing a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frame dissolves, brother-shadow and Lira merge into air, reconfiguring the sacred boundary with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—each paraphrase loosens quartz letters, mist responds, Soren’s hand fails—so the lens is Causal. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no teleporting props or retro-patches. The single beat of stepping into the circle and speaking three versions tightens options until the final image forecloses return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz pillars, and frozen lake breathe through Lira’s boots and ribs, constraining her tactical choice to soften rather than break the frame. Weather (mist threading inward) evolves with the dissolution beat, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: guards, Soren, circle, lakeward silhouette track without drift. Micro-setting succeeds: the chisel tap that answers back with a different voice is the pivot object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cross the sacred boundary to speak with the dead—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each paraphrase that loosens the quartz until the final step forecloses retreat. Pressure tightens once: Soren’s warning + dissolving cloth + mist silhouette force the stance crystallization. Cost is legible on-page: Soren’s hand passes through cloth, the decree’s words slide irreversibly, and Lira’s own form dissolves. No coincidence; agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: sacred lines are guides, not cages; paraphrase as ethical disobedience reweights inherited warnings. The colonnade’s shift from barrier to permeable membrane reconfigures meaning in the final image. No moralizing; the brother-shadow silhouette offers resonant ambiguity. Particulars (quartz hum, chisel tap, mist threading ribs) carry the conceptual freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature—sound folding wings, truth arriving like a moth—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath beats; diction stays within her poet lexicon. Soren’s single spoken line carries subtext of fear, distinct from Lira’s paraphrastic cadence. No filter-verb stacks; compression is taught early and paid off in the final breath-pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multi-duty: “her gaze aesthetically driven toward any line that might make grief look symmetrical” reveals motive, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances dissolution. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure—the final three breath-versions are almost bare—heightening the moment. Read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph cuts are surgical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lyric elegy with speculative architecture: a poet dissolves a death-border by rewriting its decree aloud. The paraphrase mechanic is non-obvious and indispensable; swap it and the story collapses. Risk—letting protagonist literally evaporate—pays off because groundwork (quartz blur, cloth-as-weather) is laid early. No close echoes; voice feels singular.</comment>
