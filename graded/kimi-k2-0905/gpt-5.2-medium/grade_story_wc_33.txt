<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivo’s “respectfully rebellious” posture is dramatized in every beat—bowing to soldiers while smuggling letters, trading silence for Nela’s guardianship, uncorking weather instead of a gun. Interiority stays concrete (“he understood then that healing did not mean undoing…”) and the final foster promise costs him the safety of neutrality. The only drag is Nela, who functions more as emblem than contradictory pressure; her dialogue is thin and she never threatens his stance. Still, his value hierarchy is legibly re-ordered on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: missing mail → rooftop smugglers → storm bottle → drone flight → Mendery reply. Closure is a decisive change—he chooses border-crossing guardianship with the bottle empty and councils potentially branding him traitor; cost is felt. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“At twilight the cobalt arcade…”) and geography stays trackable. One minor causality fuzz: the drone border codes are accepted “before the last light died” without showing how Ivo evades post-flight scrutiny, but the lapse doesn’t puncture the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arcade’s dead neon, shattered skylights and coin changers double as emotional barometer; the roof’s sensor towers physically constrain launch windows. Bottle, satchel and drone act as micro-settings that determine tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (Ivo notes “rain and static into rotors” rather than generic storm). Environment never stalls momentum; each detail either pressures choice or foreshadows cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver what was promised, including a child—tightens when the only route is law-breaking drone flight. Escalation is one-way: refusal to report smugglers → storm disable → coerced bargain → border crossing. The tightening forecloses neutrality; price is potential treason charge and empty storm bottle. Coincidence (drone schedule matching mail drop) complicates rather than rescues, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—mending broken promises by owning their cost—emerges through mail gaps, returned letters, and the final uncorked storm spent to secure one kept promise. No character sermonizes; the Mendery note’s “broken but not wasted” reweights prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext of postal silence as violence is felt, not stated. Ending image of recorked empty bottle crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Ivo’s perceptual filter—“footfalls like a secret,” “thin as a folded envelope.” Syntax lengthens under sentiment then fractures during storm release, mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; Nela’s interior is wisely withheld. Register remains postal-worker plain, never drifts into writerly flourish, sustaining credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “bottle rattled softly, holding cloud and lightning tight.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent (storm=rule-bending force). One near-miss: “brittle hush” is repeated; the reprise is purposeful but edges close to mannerism—still, it charges the final cadence rather than clogging it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusing postal noir with climate-tech relic and drone-age smuggling feels fresh yet inevitable. The storm-in-a-bottle trope is repurposed as non-lethal resistance, transforming familiar rebellion into tender sabotage. Specificity—Mendery seal, guardian ink, tower shift logs—grounds the conceit. Risk is taken (child foster via contraband drone) and paid off in earned cost.</comment>
