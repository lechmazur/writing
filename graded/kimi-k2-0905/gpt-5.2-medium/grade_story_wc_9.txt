<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interiority is vivid—her bargain with the ceiling, the ribbon tether, the choice to relive rather than flee—but the daughter remains a passive bundle; no contradictory maternal impulse is dramatized on the page, so the arc flirts with monovalent resolve rather than crucible-tested change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tree returns the hours only after the narrator accepts reliving them, a cost legible in “I stayed willingly perplexed, open to whatever hurt came.” Causality is lyric-accumulative—each image (cracked saucer, ribbon, palm-trace) re-weights time’s value—yet the lens holds cleanly from first cloud-step to final overlapping palms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (clenched fist, milk-choked throat), tool-as-setting (cracked saucer as map), and the midnight glade’s jeweled grass all constrain movement and charge the final image; spatial choreography is crystalline, with the ribbon tether and vapor-bark tree anchoring vertical travel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen maternal time—tightens when the tree demands reliving instead of theft; the pouch’s loosening is earned by the narrator’s renunciation of escape, a visible price that forecloses the easy grab-and-flee option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradoxical cost of reclaiming lost time: one must re-inhabit, not repossess. The final image of overlapping palms with a scar-like crack reconfigures the birthday custom into a record of endured hours, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably singular—soot-and-prayer decks, “milk chokes a tired throat”—with rhythmic compression that teaches its own elision; perceptual signature sustains through lyric ascent and return, never drifting into committee poetry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty (image, motion, metaphor) without scaffold; only a single mixed metaphor (“confession trapped here in weather”) momentarily clouds physics, but the final palm-trace line lands clean, ensuring no closure drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of cartomancy, cloudbound time-bank, and post-partum fugue feels inevitable yet unseen; the cracked doll saucer as divining board transforms a domestic relic into cosmic interface, a risk that pays off in specificity rather than quirk.</comment>
