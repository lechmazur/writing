<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The weaver’s interior contradiction—wanting to carry others’ grief yet fearing empty hands—grounds every beat; the embodied moment when soot blackens his palms crystallizes the flaw and its cost, earning the closure shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice fused inside his pack forever reweights his gait; the causal chain from mis-alignment to calcification to released seam is legible, and the persistent price (he must re-orient nightly) shapes future tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s drowned-star reflections and whale-rib curvature actively trap and then release the protagonist; the kerosene burner’s drilled holes function as micro-setting that constrains the pivotal rotation, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—carry burdens without turning to stone—tightens when the grotto demands the weaver’s own fixity; the calcification beat visibly forecloses escape until he pays with his own malleability, escalating under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lattice that externalizes grief while preserving the carrier; the widow’s final line reframes the weaver’s fear of emptiness without moralizing, letting the whalebone image carry the repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“shingled hush”) and sustained; perceptual signature—grief read like kelp reads tide—remains character-bound, and the final soot-mark on skin offers tactile reprise without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from tidal anapests to clipped rotations; no loops or scaffold, high density—each image advances atmosphere or stakes; mixed metaphors are avoided, and the final “whalebone reverie” line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fractal grief-weaving fused with bronze-grotto cosmology feels inevitable yet unseen before; the burner-as-sextant escape reframes quotidian object into cosmological tool, a risk that sharpens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
