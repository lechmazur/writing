<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “perpetually surprised” face is shown, not told, through her repeated startle at small discoveries; the pilgrim’s motive—decoding a radio whisper of “belonging”—drives every offer and step. Both remain consistent, but the emotional cost is only lightly sketched: Mara packs up “staying perpetually surprised,” a charming yet low-stakes coda. Interior contradiction is present—curiosity vs. caution—yet never forces a painful trade-off on her side. Closure still reconfigures their joint stance, so the arc lands, just without a bruise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tuner turns the abstract “frequency of belonging” into a literal chord the observatory sings, costing the characters nothing but re-weighting everything. Causality is clean—each chip clicks into the next, the coil hums, the dome answers—no lucky rescues. Orientation is swift: dusk, cracked steps, drone clips inside 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of assembling fragments tightens once, then resonates rather than reverses. Cost is visible in the final image—the pilgrim laughing as if he hears his name—so the ending pays on the page.</comment>

<comment>Observatory stones “drink the last light and give it back as brilliant dimness” fuses sight and paradoxical concept in one stroke; every later gleam—lantern circle, brass case, copper coil—echoes that first alchemy. The broken dome slit literally shapes how the drone exits and where star trails point, so setting constrains action. Micro-setting (matrix drawers, wall notch) supplies the final puzzle piece. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual, some metallic clink—but selective economy suits the twilight hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: complete the fragmented alphabet to hear the “frequency of belonging.” Mid-story tightening occurs when star-trail gap reveals the hidden cabinet—one deepening that narrows search to drawer-by-drawer assembly. No reversal, but the accruing pattern suffices for Accumulative lens. Price is conceptual, not tactical: the word READ locks in, pulses align, and the option of endless searching is foreclosed by the achieved chord. Sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete motif: broken type meets broken sky, both re-set into legible order—belonging as movable type finally locked for printing. Subtext lives in half-finished letterforms and half-heard radio tones; no character moralizes. Final image reweights prior material: “a family could be spelled, tuned, and shared” offers resonant reconfiguration without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—will they stay, transmit, leave?—yet the emotional after-effect is clear: fragments can compose a home.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter—star-trails read as “scratches, then curves,” drone rotors “deliberate… like a question asked of the past.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action; no head-hop. Dialogue is minimal but idiosyncratic: pilgrim’s “frequency of belonging” sounds like the exact phrase a weary code-seeker would carry. No register drift; metaphors stay mechanical-optical (lenses, punctuation, equations) matching her tech eye. Voice is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the chain sounded like punctuation in the quiet” performs three jobs—auditory, metaphorical, character beat—in nine words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language clusters only in low-tempo descriptive stretches; under peak beat (fitting chips, cranking tuner) diction turns spare and tactile. Minor alliteration (“brass…brilliant”) is pattern-taught early and feels intentional. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, strong paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing letterpress archaeology with radio astronomy feels fresh; the notion that home is a font waiting to be reassembled is specific and memorable. Risk lies in the abstract premise, yet the story grounds it through chipped metal, hand-cranked coil, and star trails—never drifting into TED-talk abstraction. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, because the half-letter “READ” and the observatory’s slit are irreplaceable images. Bold synthesis, fully committed, pays off in closure.</comment>
