<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orin’s “abrasive calm” and rational rebellion are vividly embodied in how he barters slate notes for an auger and later refuses Mara’s meal ticket—micro-choices that cost him comfort and safety. The dead navigator’s lantern-light memory is a sharp, embodied trigger for his obsession, and the final refusal lands as earned endurance rather than preachy heroism. Interiority stays concrete: the auger’s click “travels up the shaft into his teeth,” marrying sensation to motive. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “competing narratives” that edges toward thesis-speak, blunting the contradiction that should live in his gut.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: plague ends → Council erases past → Orin needs proof → digs → finds cog → refuses archival co-option. Each beat tightens options; the refusal is irreversible and costs him institutional protection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the teaching rig built from sewer pipe turns the cog into a living counter-narrative, foreclosing assimilation. The lens stays causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drowned library district—fish swimming through windows, stink of old paper and salt—functions as both grave and classroom, constraining how Orin can dig and what he can salvage. The broken spire’s silt layers act as a literal stratigraphy of civic lies, each auger turn naming a falsehood. The sewer pipe teaching rig at the end reclaims the ruin as a living instrument, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the auger, the cog’s green teeth) repeatedly guides tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether memory of navigational art survives—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened when Mara demands ownership. The meaningful tightening occurs when Orin widens the hole “by hand,” trading speed for control, accepting physical exhaustion as price. Refusal of the meal ticket forecloses institutional validation; the cost is immediate isolation. Pressure escalates because each narrative layer he drills through physically exhausts him and narrows his social options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—how collective memory is weaponized or preserved—emerges through the tactile act of digging and the final image of a homemade orrery powered by a single corroded cog. No character states the moral; the sewer rig’s slow click becomes the city’s new heartbeat. Subtext in Mara’s “practiced sympathy” implies institutional absorption of all dissent. The ending’s conceptual repricing is legible: the Council’s clean sand is now counter-timed by an underground gear that refuses to stop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Orin’s perceptual filter: “sewer water kept whispering” is his projection, not authorial flourish. Syntax mirrors his sanding-away calm—short, gritted clauses that flare only when the auger strikes metal. The single line of dialogue (Mara’s) carries bureaucratic condescension, distinct from the narrative’s abrasive spareness. No head-hopping or register drift; even the metaphor of “measured teeth” stays within a navigator’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “green with age but sharp as a fresh decision” compresses time and agency into one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either stratigraphy or bodily strain. Rhythm accelerates during the dig—long sentence for the auger’s descent, staccato fragment when metal clicks. One near-miss: “principles needed anchors” flirts with aphorism, but the next sentence buries the cliché under pipe fittings and sewer stench.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-plague memory wars are familiar terrain, yet the stratigraphic dig through civic propaganda layers—naming each band of lies—feels fresh and specific to this drowned city. The chronometer cog as the smallest possible survivor of navigational science is a lovely, non-obvious MacGuffin. Risk is taken by refusing any triumphant surface victory; the ending settles into damp darkness where knowledge survives one student at a time. Transformation is complete: the story would collapse if the cog were merely a coin or a book.</comment>
