<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic attachment vs. emotional evasion—are dramatized in the cave: he both hides the shell and re-paints it, speaks aloud the fear he has prettified. The final micro-choice (setting the shell where tide will intermittently erase/reveal it) crystallizes the arc with visible cost: he surrenders perfect distance for imperfect intimacy. Interiority stays concrete, body-attuned; no label-speak. One beat short of 9+ gate: the promise-tightening could have bitten earlier to force an even steeper concession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cracked mirror → quay return → cave wrong-turn → oasis discovery → public vow. Each step tightens options until the spoken promise forecloses lifelong aloofness; tide’s future erasure of the shell supplies persistent constraint/cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt price—he exits “ready to paint arrivals,” stance flipped. Meets 9+ quick test cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, tunnels, and micro-setting of the body (wet boots, cloth pouch) constrain movement and supply materials—seawater becomes paint medium, barnacle rim dictates shell placement. Selective sensory triage (kelp-smoke draft, pencil of sun) mirrors Lio’s narrowed emotional aperture. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room beats. Environment directly charges the final image—tide’s cyclic cover/uncover—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will he keep or bury the promise?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure escalates through narrowing space (forking tunnels) and rising interior urgency (“time has begun to leak”). The wrong-turn that reveals the oasis forces the public vow, narrowing future social distance; cost is the shell’s future erosion and the emotional exposure he can’t retract. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as temporary anchor against impermanence—emerges through concrete cycle: paint, tide, repaint, erasure. Final image of intermittent shell-gleam offers non-literal answer: you “stay” by naming the instant, then relinquishing control. No moralizing; subtext lives in gesture and tidal rhythm. Complexity intact: intimacy remains risky, beauty still partial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lio’s perceptual filter: color-mixing metaphors, painterly light vocabulary, bodily chill. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during tunnel chase, then slows to drip-echoes in oasis—intentional cadence shift. No head-hopping; psychic distance cleanly controlled. Distinctive syntactic music without overwriting satisfies 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action plus atmospheric data—without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“barnacles ring the pool like a crown”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift. Final paragraph lands with resonant brevity; zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines cracked-mirror bad omen, cave oasis, and painted shell into fresh configuration: the artist confronts his own vanishing image and chooses impermanent witness. Concept of “temporary eternity” reweights familiar tidal motifs without feeling borrowed. Risky interior monologue-in-cave pays off. Slight dock for echo of “paint the instant” trope; still feels particularized through Lio’s occupational lens.</comment>
