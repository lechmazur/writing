<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oren’s centuries-long endurance and reverence for bone-towers are concrete; his refusal to chase grief-laden echoes shows interior contradiction under pressure. The final stillness that lets the pulse enter is a credible renunciation of physical travel, paid for by the dawn-loss of the birdsong map. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays specific to a stone-being’s sensorium. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied in the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Oren does not move, yet the canyon returns a singable route, reconfiguring navigation itself. The arrowhead’s alignment and the flock-split syncopation are the visible cost/constraint that shape the final tactic. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust-memories and overtone layers tighten until the dawn fade reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the canyon…”) and the bone tower crown by midpoint; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bone tower’s wind-organ literally amplifies Oren’s hum, enabling the pulse catch. The arrowhead’s striations matching canyon sound-lines fuses tool and environment, constraining the alignment choice at climax. Micro-setting (tower crown) doubles as resonant chamber; without it the map-song fails. Sensory selection stays narrow—sound, dust, wind—filtered through a stone-body’s proprioception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn to travel by tone alone—is signaled in paragraph two and tested when the flock-split forces a mid-hum tuning choice. The tightening beat: refusing to chase grief-echoes narrows options to stillness, risking permanent failure. Cost is legible: the birds depart, taking the live script with them; Oren keeps only an internal sequence of intervals. Under Accumulative lens the pressure is a density of returning overtones that eventually foreclose physical motion as a viable path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic archaeology: history is not a place but a relationship sustained by listening. The arrowhead’s repurposing from weapon to tuning key reweights violence into reverence without moralizing. Final image of a “map you could sing” offers conceptual repricing: knowledge becomes audible obligation. No tidy moral—just the cost of bearing centuries of others’ footfalls in one’s own resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly calcified to Oren’s mineral sensorium—“his body rang in thirds,” “stone could feel.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with the hum’s sustain or cutoff, creating rhythmic signature. No head-hopping; birds remain unreadable except through wing-geometry pressure. Compressed diction (“dust memories,” “heart rock”) feels native to an immortal lithic mind rather than writerly ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal—“Each return carried dust memories, layers of footfalls and lost prayers.” No paraphrase loops; every clause adds new acoustic information. Figurative vehicles stay coherent within a sonic geology—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-slip: “weathered resolve” edges toward label-speak, but the next line immediately embodies it in breathing steadiness, so closure beat remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Harmonic stone skimmer” and “pulse left wandering” synthesize geology with music theory to produce a navigation system impossible in another world. The bone towers as fossilized giants transforms familiar canyon scenery into an echoic instrument. Risk is high—entire plot hinges on sound as spatial currency—yet execution stays internally consistent. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: stillness becomes locomotion through listened intervals.</comment>
