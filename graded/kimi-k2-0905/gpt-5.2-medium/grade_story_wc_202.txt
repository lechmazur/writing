<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is concrete—tracing the spiral, tasting salt words—yet the final beat of “speaking names into street corners” is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels slightly abstract rather than embodied. Still, the hierarchy of values (mother’s injunction vs. civic forgetting) is legible and drives every micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the joined lens reweights whose names circulate in the city, with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—lens fragment → spiral → hatch → rejected canvases → spoken names—each beat narrows options until the seam is anchored. The “eternal instant” final image crystallizes the before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The market’s copper chimneys and swaying catwalks constrain movement and supply the hidden hatch; the drowned city’s cold light is felt on skin, charging the final image. Micro-setting (lens fragment as portable environment) literally refracts what can be seen, directly shaping the protagonist’s tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the seam open long enough to rescue erased names—tightens when the fragment darkens and the hatch threatens to seal. One meaningful deepening: fitting the lens halves collapses the two cities into simultaneous perception, foreclosing anonymity forever. Price is paid in irreversible exposure of the rejected histories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral, lens, and names: memory is an optic that must be physically handled, not merely invoked. The final image of “histories no one could overlook again” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving the reader with the civic cost of now-undeniable ghosts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person lyric remains stable; perceptual signature—“mist that still wets your hands,” “salt language” tasted—stays idiosyncratic under pressure. Compression (“I spoke the names into street corners”) is earned by earlier patterned elision and does not break causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathless climbs to short pulses (“Cold light breathed up”) without algorithmic pattern. No loops or mixed metaphors; every image either advances setting or refracts light, sustaining momentum to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse shard as archival tool feels inevitable yet fresh; the drowned city of rejected painters reframes gentrification as literal submergence. Risk—merging two cities in one sentence—pays off by making the social cost visually undeniable.</comment>
