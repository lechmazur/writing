<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lio’s aromatic caution, debt guilt, and need to keep the vial closed are dramatized through breath-control and trembling hands; the final uncorking is earned by the revealed filial link and costs him his broker identity. Interiority stays concrete—“his tears were not weakness but memory insisting on being felt” avoids label-speak. One micro-choice—letting “one measured breath” escape—crystallizes the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: anonymous note → Conservatory at moonrise → vial reveals mother’s scent → catalyzes resurrection → Lio renounces selling light. Closure is a Decisive Change: he pockets the vial and hangs lanterns for others, a visible forfeit of former trade. Cost is on-page: “he finally chose to keep instead of sell.” Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s extinct pots, ultraviolet cracks, and pollen residue on cuffs constrain every beat: the setting supplies the catalyst bed, the revealing tool, and the filial proof. Spatial choreography is tight—Lio between dead orchid and fossil fern, Dr. Vann pointing to the trembling husks. Final image of lanterns hung among resurrected vines recharges the opening “crystal shadows” with living light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Lio uncork grief or stay safe—tightens when moonrise and trembling husks force the choice; the single breath release narrows options and visibly pays the price of his broker identity. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as living seed that must be smelled, wept over, and tended—emerges through fern-shaped pollen and the final lantern gift, never sermonized. The vial’s reprise in pocket reweights the premise: remembrance can grow stewardship, not merely sorrow. Subtext in Dr. Vann’s silent nod and the glowing ledger line carries filial absolution without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lio’s perceptual filter—“aromatically cautious,” “lamp oil on her gloves”—with rhythmic compression matching breath-holding tension. No head-hopping; Dr. Vann’s dialogue is spare and subtextual. Ultraviolet reveal and pollen glow carry consistent lyric texture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and clause to mimic inhalation/exhalation; no scaffold loops. Figurative layer—“crystal shadows,” “green tongues curled out”—is selective and tied to stakes. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and causality. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Extinct-plant greenhouse + scent-catalyst resurrection + grief-broker protagonist synthesizes fresh angle on memory-as-botany. Ultraviolet lamp as emotional lie-detector is a specific, risk-taking device that charges closure. While “scent triggers memory” is familiar, the gene-mapped algae batteries and lantern commerce particularize the world.</comment>
