<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara’s interior contradiction—clinging to voice yet surrendering it—plays out in embodied beats (pressing the bead, guiding Jun’s fingers). The final renunciation is earned by the loom’s prior stillness and the orchard’s hush. One hairline slip: “wistful” is named, not shown, in the opening line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each added thread thickens silence until the border closes and voice is traded. Closure is a Charged Poise—Yara’s mute breath and Jun’s reading fingers—cost legible in the same instant the panel vanishes. Causality is intact: puzzle edges → map → path → voice lost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s unharvested pears and bamboo hush act as micro-setting that constrains choice: the quieter the loom, the louder the trespass of breath. Puzzle-edge rectangle literally frames the weave; amber bead’s warmth anchors sensory specificity. Final image of salt-crusted Jun stepping through bamboo recharges every prior silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. message—tightens when silence demands payment. One meaningful deepening: the loom drinks laughter, leaving only steady hands. Cost is visible, but escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal complicates the path after the border locks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacrifice as woven distance emerges through action, not statement. Final mute instruction—Yara guiding Jun’s fingers—reconfigures love as tactile continuity, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: orchard remains quiet, voice never returns, yet reunion is complete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Yara’s perceptual edge: “raveling silence,” “resin light,” syntax mirroring shuttle rhythm. No head-hopping; Jun’s arrival is filtered through Yara’s mute attention. Compressed diction stays within loom-spinner’s lexicon; one clause—“therapy-speak” risk in “forgot how to hope”—is saved by its barracks context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long filamentary builds to single-word clauses under pressure; no template cadence. Figurative layering is high but patterned—silence as thread, dusk, tide—each recurrence reweights stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; information density carries dual duty (image + causality).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw border as map-frame for impossible-message weaving, voice traded for tactile letter. Risk—lyric stillness in 700 words—pays off in mute closure. Transformation test fails if relocated: orchard hush, loom lore, and puzzle edges are irreplaceable.</comment>
