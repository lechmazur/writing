<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s wound-for-gift trade is vivid and embodied; the moment she recovers her mother’s voice in exchange for wrapping a child crystallizes contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final choice—leaving some borrowed memories unreturned—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam of communal dawn opens with undeniable conceptual cost—Lysa’s partial self-loss is visible in the same image that saves the realm. Causal chain holds: because she weaves communal cloth, the night tightens, infants are wrapped, memory returns, dawn spills. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Lysa walked toward…”) and the mica window beats teach the mirror-pattern early. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural drive holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s mercury apples, salt pears, and grafted-loom branches constrain every tactical choice; the mica window’s star-split veins literally pattern the cloth’s weave. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lysa’s spinner-biased attention: touch of paper-bark, warmth of glimmer-thread, sound of caretakers murmuring to keep color from the dark. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies, infants, cloth, and reflected light track cleanly across the single scene. The setting charges the final image: the bolt held to the window becomes the portal that re-lights the realm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach the realm morning again—tightens when night “tightens like a collar” in direct response to each new dawn-thread; the escalation is textural but legible. One meaningful deepening suffices: the infants’ swaddling converts abstract dawn into mortal vulnerability, forcing Lysa to pay with her own returning memories. Cost is visible on-page: “she suddenly remembered her mother’s voice,” paid in the same sentence a child is wrapped. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: collective memory and shared light outweigh private wholeness. The final image—dawn banners hanging from doorways—reweights the opening premise that promises echo twice; now the echo is communal. Subtext lives in gesture: leaving some borrowed yesterdays in the satchel is a promise, not a theft—an ethical reconfiguration shown, not told. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is carried by the cloth itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lysa’s spinner-perception: verbs like “braided,” “glimmers,” “netted” mirror her craft. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath—song-lines stretch, then snap into short clauses when night fights back. No head-hopping; chemists’ fear is filtered through Lysa’s ear. The diction never exceeds her nettle-and-cradle lexicon; even “cinnabar” is introduced as loom-part, not mineral lecture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or memory economy. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight split by mica becomes thread that “warmed her fingers like breath held too long,” fusing tactile and temporal. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pulled,” “fought,” “spill”). Rhythm modulates from incantatory song to urgent clause burst at the climax, mirroring night’s tightening collar. Final line lands on concrete noun-verb pair—“long awaited sky”—without abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The mirror-world premise is not window-dressing; its backward rivers and double promises are literalized in the mica window’s split reflection that enables the dawn-seam. Woven dawns as communal textile is a fresh synthesis of mythic loom and solar physics. Risk—using lyric accumulation instead of causal reversals—pays off because the pattern is taught early and closure reweights the stakes. The piece could not swap names or places without collapsing; the specificity of nettle songs and mercury apples is irreplaceable.</comment>
