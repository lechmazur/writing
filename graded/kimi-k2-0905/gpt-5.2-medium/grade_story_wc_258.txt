<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is textured (“steadily curious, not brave”) and embodied emotion arrives in small, specific tics (unspooling tape as trust ritual). The narrator’s micro-choice to accept the deck at the end crystallizes a credible shift from passive inheritance to active stewardship, paying a quiet social cost (promise to return). Aurel’s shame over steering traders supplies a secondary pressure point that sharpens the protagonist’s stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, keeping the arc slightly one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final map reweights the city’s “cultural heartbeat” and the narrator accepts a lifelong obligation—cost is legible in the promise to “come back whenever the city changes shape.” Causal chain holds: grandmother’s encoded tape → Aurel’s confession → night walk measuring three stories → map that reframes crisis as pattern. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (loft, skylight, post-crash hush). One minor elasticity: the off-stage “riot” and “water-truck queues” are told, not shown, but they feed the conceptual reprice rather than resolve plot, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight, wet-stone smell, and brass tape glints are selective and POV-filtered. The loft’s beams become a literal grid for decoding dates, so setting constrains the cognitive task. City streets are sketched via three sensory routes (pawnshops, murals, lullabies) that feed the final map. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can inherited pattern-mapping replace profit-seeking prophecy?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Aurel admits past misuse, forcing the narrator to decide whether to shoulder the practice. The midnight walk is the visible cost (time, exposure, social risk of being seen measuring ruins). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is felt in the final promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—culture as measurable, reparable tissue rather than commodity—emerges through tape-as-key and map-as-heartbeat, never named. Subtext in Aurel’s ink-stained fingers conveys guilt without exposition. Final image of “hush becomes a language” offers resonant reweighting. No moralizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a hushed, archival cadence that mirrors the “listening hush.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then snaps short at choices (“I folded the tape”). Perceptual signature is consistent: numbers, inches, dates as emotional vocabulary. No head-hopping; Aurel’s interior is inferred only through gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering (“rain stitched the dusk into silver lines”) is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One filter-verb cluster (“I understood the inheritance she left”) is brief and earned. Rhythm modulates with scene tempo—long reflective sentences early, shorter beats at the final fold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of cartomancy, post-crypto collapse, and artisanal measurement feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator. Grandmother’s inch-coded dates invert usual dystopia tropes into tactile ethnography. Risk—using a measuring tape as both literal tool and symbolic key—pays off in the final map. Transformation test fails if tape becomes any generic heirloom.</comment>
