<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leander’s mute resolve and scholar’s hunger are shown through tactile micro-choices; the abdication carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The single on-page character limits relationship crucible, but status tension with absent ministers is implied through silence. Earned renunciation meets 9- gate; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, only steady resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (crank→panel→ledger→voice) tightens options toward abdication. Closure is a Decisive Change with treasury forfeiture; cost is legible in “ordered the crown’s treasury turned to the lost bridge.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (treasury loss) shapes final tactic. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia reading room, gramophone parts, and charcoal dust are filtered through Leander’s scholar-eye; every detail enables the next move. The crank handle reappears as closure talisman, charging final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, slide, lift, balcony. Micro-setting (crank notch) literally unlocks plot. No sensory checklist; selection mirrors hush and secrecy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove betrayal to justify abdication—signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: Nara’s recorded confession forecloses any remaining option to rule. Cost is treasury surrender; pressure coherent under causal lens. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 600-word scope. Agency resides in decision to expose, not in coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—restitution versus inherited guilt—emerges from stolen bridge plans and Leander’s surrender of treasury. Subtext lives in “eloquently silent gaze” and the choice to return crank to notch as invitation, not concealment. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No thematic echo; silence carries irony. Complexity accepted: dynasty ends, bridge may rise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“sepia,” “charcoal,” “standing waves”) stays within scholar-prince lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments at discovery. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Filter verbs serve POV—“he felt the old room release its grip”—not padding. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“bridge sketched in ash”—never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often advances plot, mood, and image. Copy clean; no tense drift. Closure sentence breathes perfectly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gramophone as both lock and witness, intuition as literal bridge-building guide. Premise transforms familiar “guilty dynasty” trope through acoustic archaeology. Risk—quiet abdication without speech—pays off because treasury cost is concrete. Specificity of wax strip confession prevents generic feel. Not quite 9+ because core arc (last heir atones) remains recognizable template.</comment>
