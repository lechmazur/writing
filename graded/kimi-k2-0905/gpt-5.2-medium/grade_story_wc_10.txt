<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orren’s survivor guilt and bone-level rhythm memory drive every micro-choice; the empty tuning-fork slot externalizes his need and charges the final gesture. Mara’s silent authority and quick penciled strokes create a crisp status crucible that forces Orren to risk his only relic. The child’s flinch and recovery supply a visible cost loop that proves the system works and completes his arc. Interiority stays embodied—heat on skin, tremor in bench—never sliding into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty slot becomes “a question, not a loss” that reweights silence into communal music; cost is felt in the brass fork pressed to a child’s palm and the bench’s bright vibration. Causal chain holds—missing fork causes calibration failure → fork returned → system rectified → silence translated. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“winterglass conservatory”). No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens because each thermal map tests Orren’s sailor-wave knowledge under public scrutiny.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frost flowers between glass layers and pulse-lamps without hum teach the world rule early; the conservatory’s iced panes literally refract the new silence. The tuning-fork case and brass fork act as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice on the table. Spatial choreography is pristine—bodies move from vitrines to center table to benches without drift. Final image of the glowing conservatory is charged by the earlier frost/heat polarity, making environment sing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can silence be translated into shared music?—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the thermal system warps songs into flat pulses. One meaningful tightening: the missing fork must be reunited or the communal choir collapses; Orren’s decision to hand the brass fork to the child crystallizes the trade-off. Cost is visible—the fork leaves his possession again, now with purpose, and the child’s heat pattern sharpens under public gaze. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the flaw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of loss into instrument: silence not conquered but translated by shared vulnerability. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s throat-touch, Orren’s wrist-press—never declared. The empty slot’s final reconfiguration from wound to question offers resonant non-literal wisdom without moralizing. Thermal emotion-as-score reframes disability as communal resource rather than individual deficit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization clings to Orren’s sailor-honed perception—rhythm in bones, wave crest mime—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax is crisp, maritime-tinged (“trimmed sails”) yet precise under pressure. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is legible only through her gestures and slate strokes. Final paragraph modulates into lyrical ascent without losing control, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, heat, or choice. Figurative language is sparse, surgical—“missing tooth” for the empty slot—never clutters high-pressure beats. Paragraph lengths breathe with the thermal tide, accelerating during calibration test, lengthening at final glow. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges frost/heat polarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—global silence translated via skin-heat into shared vibration—feels inevitable yet uncopied. Tuning forks as calibration weights for emotion is a fresh synthesis of maritime tech and disability poetics. Risk taken: entire story hinges on thermal mapping believability, but grounded detail (black patches, sensor grid) and embodied cost sell the marvel. The empty slot’s repricing from absence to purpose delivers a non-obvious emotional turn that lingers.</comment>
