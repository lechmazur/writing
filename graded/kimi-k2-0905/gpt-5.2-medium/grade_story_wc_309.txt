<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Davin’s hunger for the sacred is visceral; his choice to climb unarmed and abandon gear crystallizes a credibly flawed, impulsive mage. Interiority stays concrete—“inkless fingers,” “hungry heart”—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the stone) costs him the very proof he came for, earned by prior refusals. Only the “underachieving” tag is asserted, never tested on-page, keeping him a hair shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keystone’s unmeasurable glow persists while the automaton stalls, reweighting the premise that only quantified magic matters. Causal chain holds—because he strips gear and trusts mist walking, he reaches the terrace; because he chooses a child-simple pattern, the luminance answers. Cost is visible: he forfeits the keystone and any guild recognition. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image’s cadence shift deepens the dominant stake without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Icebound spire, river fog, frost-roses—each sensory layer is filtered through Davin’s need for unprogrammed wonder. The folly bench warmed by reflected cloud-light is an exact, POV-colored detail that later constrains his ritual. Micro-setting (the keystone’s quartz thumbprint) literally charges the final image. Environment never stalls action; it guides the mist-walk exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—tightens when the automaton arrives to harvest the keystone, forcing a choice between theft and renunciation. Escalation is textural: each ascent beat strips another layer of tech (harness, then mist walking, then empty hands), reweighting cost. The final forfeiture forecloses quantified proof, paying the price on-page. No reversal, but the deepening pattern satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the keystone’s refusal to be data: sacredness = light that declines measurement. Subtext lives in gesture—three frost-petals replace a grand ward, implying reverence is small, handmade. The automaton’s polite arithmetic silenced by “brilliant dimness” reconfigures value without moralizing. Final image answers the thematic question obliquely: simplicity endured, automation baffled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Davin’s perceptual signature—“silver dark where lanterns became halos.” Syntax lengthens during mist-walk, then fractures as stairs argue with geometry, mirroring disorientation. No head-hopping; automaton’s voice is reported from his ears. Diction—“lingering luminance,” “absurdly, like laughter trapped in ice”—is consistent, lyrical, yet precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “a needle of blue ice thrust through sun” anchors size, color, danger in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last rather than repeats. Rhythm accelerates up the spiral, then breathes on the terrace. Only one filter-verb cluster (“he heard…he felt”) but it occurs pre-climax and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Automated creativity versus handmade ritual is familiar, yet the inversion—human climbs to save a stone from being data—feels non-obvious. Mist-walk as corporeal “blur where body can’t quite exist” freshens both teleport trope and pilgrimage. The folly keystone’s refusal to parse into guild metrics supplies a conceptual reprice that grows organically from prior beats. Specificity of frost-petals and quartz thumbprint prevents abstraction.</comment>
