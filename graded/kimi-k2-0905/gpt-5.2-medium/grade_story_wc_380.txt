<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s grief-driven trespass is visceral and embodied; the lantern-flame bowing to each dot of the chain shows micro-choice under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final re-recognition by her father lands as earned cost because the prior salt-jar theft and beach ritual have foreclosed the “mercy” path. Cap at 8.7 only because the council’s motive is asserted, not dramatized, slightly blunting the moral stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the whale sinks, gravity pockets snap shut, and the father’s returned memory carries undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Causal—each jar opened therefore collapses the forgetting. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), the salt-drain heist tightens options, and the final lantern-bow reprises the opening silence with reweighted sorrow. No plot amnesia; every beat pays forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The harbor’s “gleaming silence,” salt-crystal walls that swallow sound, and the lantern flame bending under invisible gravity constrain Lysa’s stealth and later ritual; environment actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting (coffee cup on salt ledge) doubles as divination tool, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lysa’s professional eye—light, weight, scent—never tourist catalog. One hairline slip: the “reversed sky” is evocative but not anchored in bodily perception, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: each jar opened narrows the council’s bargain, raises risk of discovery, and increases personal exposure. The midnight drain breach is the visible price that forecloses neutrality. Joy and skill are named as next targets, but the on-page cost is already legible in the father’s blank stare and Lysa’s rope-tied descent, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is not pathology but the salt that preserves identity. The whale-as-parasite-bait reconfigures sorrow from burden to currency, repriced when jars are opened. No final moralizing; the last image of “lived-in sorrow” lets the reader feel the reweighting. Ambiguity lingers: the town may hate her, but the story refuses to sermonize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is taut, coastal, and lamp-lit: “the silence shone so hard it felt like a blade in my throat.” Syntax mirrors tidal surge—long briny clauses, then abrupt chips of mortar. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays lantern-bright and salt-bitter. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction is outside Lysa’s lexicon in this evaluator’s notes only, not in the story text—so no deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—gravity pockets, glass cities, lantern moths—and never stacked in high-pressure beats. Rhythm modulates from hush to blade-bright to final cadenced release. Proof-clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten memories stored in salt crystals beneath a beached-whale parasite is a synthesis that feels inevitable once revealed. The coffee-ground divination and lantern-flame compass are fresh instruments of plot, not quirky ornament. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the closing bow of flame. Transformation test fails if relocated: the saltworks, whale, and tide-flat gravity are irreplaceable.</comment>
