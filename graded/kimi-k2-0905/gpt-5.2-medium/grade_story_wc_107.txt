<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-riven return and the micro-choice to embed the cracked bookmark into every glass panel embody contradictory impulses (shame vs. reparative making) under rising pressure; the final quiet renunciation of narration shows earned change with visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interiority stays concrete, tied to kiln heat and glass viscosity; no diagnostic self-talk. The only bar to 9.0: we never see her interact with a second present character, so status crucible and voice distinction bullets are N/A rather than executed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the control-room-turned-observatory glass walls crystallize her bid to reopen inquiry, bookmark centered, cost paid in relinquished secrecy and assumed surveillance risk; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thaw and glass build-up reweights stakes. Causality holds: because she abandoned colleagues, therefore she returns alone; because she fuses the bookmark into each pane, the room becomes a transparent confession. Orientation clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor non-closure slip: the “first stranger” future beat is projected, not dramatized, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Permafrost drip, sighing tiles, and antenna meltwater anchor time and deterioration; the kiln’s blue flame and thin glass sheets act as micro-setting that directly constrain her tactical choices (fuel limits, panel fragility). Bookmark reappears as tactile object pressed into cooling glass, charging the final image. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Falls just short of 9 because environment does not force a last-beat tactical adaptation—she finishes the room before any external pressure tests it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can inquiry be made safe—signalled early; pressure escalates through each glass panel that makes eavesdropping harder but self-exposure certain. Mid-story micro-turn: she stops narrating, accepting silence as cost—this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc. Price is legible: former colleagues’ absence and her solitary vigil. Could reach 8.8+ if a live antagonist or material setback had forced a final trade-off; as is, tension is atmospheric rather than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge needs its scars visible—emerges through fused bookmark seams and glass transparency, never sermonized. Subtext in her theatrical monologues masking guilt, silence finally replacing them. Final image reframes prior abandonment as ongoing exposure, offering conceptual repricing without moral. Docked a tenth for a near-echo of the prompt’s exact “safe to ask” line on the bookmark; still organic within POV.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice carries glassblower precision: “molten silica into panels as thin as pages.” Rhythm modulates—declamatory cadence during narration, short reflective fragments when guilt surfaces. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s artisan lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; internal monologue performs the same action function. Meets 9+ quick test for perceptual signature and controlled elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density: each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is selective—ice “exhaled,” consoles “like ribs”—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” idea risks abstraction, but it is earned by concrete glass/bookmark fusion. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains luminous and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-thaw SF with artisanal glass-making feels novel; bookmark-as-flaw device literalizes “knowledge breaks.” Risk-taking in structure—single-character, no antagonist—pays off via accumulative image pattern. Not quite 9 because core redemption arc tropes are familiar; specificity of glass craft and frozen station transforms them enough for 8+ band.</comment>
