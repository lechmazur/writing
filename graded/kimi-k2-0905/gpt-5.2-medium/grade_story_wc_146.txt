<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sava’s “cryptic” label is asserted, not dramatized; his riddles stay ornamental. The interior contradiction promised by the fork’s warning note is never embodied in a visible choice—he simply keeps walking. Mara’s arc is cleaner: her decision to join re-balances the town, but the cost (bled soles, exile risk) is told, not felt. Still, the pair’s braided rhythm gives enough micro-choice to keep the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carrier folds the decree, the town hums alive, the fork is pocketed—cost is the unspoken future vigilance. Causality holds: each footfall → fork resonance → object answer → social proof. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift. The single tightening beat (mass walk under the arch) is sufficient for 700-word scope. Only the off-stage governor threat keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt arch as town-ear, cobbles as throat—setting is literally the instrument being tuned. Micro-setting (fork against stone, dust spirals) constrains tactics: Sava must strike exact spots to elicit response. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Sava hears first, sees second, smells cold ovens last. Fountain’s wet note at the end re-images the place as re-tuned body—meets 9+ gate for charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the town be heard as alive?”—is signaled early and tested once: the decree carrier’s arrival. Escalation is accumulative: each new walker thickens the resonance rather than raising causal threat. The tightening is the final mass step; price is the unspoken obligation to keep walking. No visible personal loss beyond sore feet keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: collective rhythm as civic existence. Subtext lives in gesture—folded paper, unpocketed fork—never sermonized. Final image reweights “balance” from acoustic to social contract without stating it. The refusal to name the collapse keeps ambiguity fertile; slight deduction for the abstract “shared balance” phrase uttered aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Sava’s perceptual filter: sound first, light second. Syntax lengthens and shortens with footfall cadence; no filter-verb clutter. “Wild hush” is established early and modulated—dog pads, kiln ping, fountain gurgle—without voice drift. One clause of elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is avoided; prose earns high band.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do double duty: “dust rose in spirals” shows both acoustic energy and visual payoff. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the instrument conceit. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric stride sentences vs. single-strike fragments. Only a single mixed image—“warning bird” note too high—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Tuning a ghost town through pedestrian acoustics is fresh; the fork-as-compass and arch-as-ear feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk—quiet climax without violence—pays off via sonic resurrection. Slight echo of Bradbury’s “April Witch” cadence, but transformed through material acoustics.</comment>
