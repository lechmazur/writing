<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go—are dramatized in the copper-lattice scene where she agrees to seal the memory; the final micro-choice to request future access under her own authority shows earned change with visible cost (the shell’s silence). Interiority is concrete (“shell’s silence in her pocket like a completed sentence”), not label-heavy. Brother’s off-stage decision motivates her but never eclipses her on-page agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shell → unregistered memory → must archive → lattice translation → sealed jar → Mira gains future access. Closure is a Decisive Change: she relinquishes immediate possession but secures autonomous return, cost shown in “completed sentence” image. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velvet garden, black-rose pergola, and humming glasshouse are filtered through Mira’s skeptical gaze; sensory selection narrows to the shell’s weight and the ward’s tuning hum under pressure. The lattice-tool and dew timing constrain the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep brother’s voice vs. city safety—tightens when the shell’s illegal status forces the archive-or-lose dilemma. One meaningful turn: agreeing to seal the pattern in exchange for future access, price = immediate loss of whisper. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “isolation forged into choice” emerges through the shell’s journey from private whisper to sealed public record; final image of workshop beyond gates reweights absence as creative hinge. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance carried by the hinge metaphor. Ambiguity remains: city still fears echoes, Mira still mourns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mira’s perceptions; no head-hops. Distinct syntactic rhythm—long lyrical sentences that breathe under twilight, then shorten at the lattice strike. Diction stays within her lexicon; “tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve” feel like her ironic phrasing, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings. Occasional stacked modifiers (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and pays off in final image. No paraphrase loops; information density high. One mixed metaphor stretch—“light quarantined from the day”—but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-contagion + resonance-archive feels fresh, not standard dystopia trope. Shell-splitting as promise-token transforms familiar grief object into reversible key. Final workshop plan grows organically from archive tech rather than tacked-on twist. Risky lyric density mostly succeeds; small residue of ornamental diction keeps it from 9+.</comment>
