<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rowan’s interior contradiction—scientific skeptic vs. reluctant caretaker of folklore—drives every micro-choice; the moment he sets the changeling’s jaw, the trait and the cost fuse. The “forgiving skeptic” label is shown, not told, through his refusal to shame grief and his tactile diagnosis of the girl. One minor slip: the phrase “yearning steadied into work” edges toward abstraction, blunting the embodied beat that otherwise crystallizes his arc.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rowan steps through the living door, tooth and star map tied together—cost is the irreversible surrender of certainty. Causal chain holds: substitute body → notebook → tooth → recognition → setting the jaw → crossing threshold, each because/therefore link tightening options. No orientation debt; geography and timeline stay legible from first reed to final hedge slit.</comment>

<comment>The garden’s micro-setting—sundials beside hybrid roses, silent pump in the old fountain—actively constrains Rowan’s discovery of the notebook and later the tin box; space is mapped without clutter. The reed-bank returns with precise sensory difference on second visit, re-weighted by new knowledge. One hairline gap: we never feel the temperature of dusk, a missed chance to body the cost of staying after dark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Rowan accept responsibility for a truth that bruises the town—tightens when he recognizes his own splint technique on the substitute corpse. The final choice to cross the hedge door forecloses the safe path of signed death certificates; price is the surrender of professional certainty. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each artifact (notebook, tooth, star map) raises the cost of remaining a skeptic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: mistakes can be navigational stars if one bears their weight. The constellation motif moves from Lina’s child map to Rowan’s final act of tying the tooth to it—conceptual repricing that reweights every prior error. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is carried by the image of a man stitching a baby tooth into a sky of his own failures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Rowan’s medical gaze; perceptual signature is bone-setter literal—he “feels a misaligned hinge” instead of guessing at magic. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short diagnostic beats during the jaw-setting, mirroring his regained clinical calm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the single line of dialogue is spare and child-strange, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the wrong kind of familiar, like seeing his own handwriting in a threat” does double duty—metaphor and stakes in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. The final clause “determined to chart whatever came next” could be trimmed to avoid a touch of editorial summary, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Folklore of changelings is inverted: the mimic is not monster but apprentice, and the healer’s craft becomes the emotional key—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once the splint marks are noticed. Risk is high—quiet magical realism inside medical realism—yet the story commits fully, never winking at the reader. The star-map of errors is a device that could feel twee but here reconfigures the entire moral universe without a single explanatory paragraph.</comment>
