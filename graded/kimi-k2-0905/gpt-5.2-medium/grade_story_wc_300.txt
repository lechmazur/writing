<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from bureaucratic certifier to carrier-of-light is legible through embodied micro-choices (taking the pearl, fixing it above the door). The widower’s tremor and pearl-fondling externalize guilt without diagnostic labels. Both characters abandon a path—sealing the hatch, hiding the pearl—at visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s public crowning re-weights the bunker from exclusion to confession-site. Causal chain—pearl drinks regret → Mara re-uses it as beacon—holds. Cost is felt in the widower’s exposed shame and the shelter’s permanent unsealing. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maintenance shaft, fossil shell, and lantern-fractured crystals are tactile waypoints that guide the descent and later ascent. Pearl-as-micro-setting constrains the final action: only its glow fits the entrance crown. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and refracted light, mirroring internal softening. Environment directly shapes the culminating gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seal or open the bunker—tightens when confession becomes the price of light. One meaningful deepening: pearl’s shift from private relic to communal beacon narrows options to “leave open.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each spoken regret intensifies radiance, reweighting social cost. Protagonist agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: survival architecture becomes useless unless hearts open first. No moralizing; the unsealed door and glowing pearl reconfigure the meaning of “shelter.” Final image answers the implicit question—what deserves preservation?—without statement. Subtext of pearl as guilt-battery charges every beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays latched to Mara’s perceptual filter: “tapping steel doors,” “lantern light broke into silent rainbows.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens during inspection tasks. No head-hopping; widower’s interior accessed only through gesture and reported confession. Distinct texture sustained to final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: clipped inspection verbs yield to liquid consonants in caves. No loops; each sentence adds image or stakes. Figurative language peaks in the crystal reveal yet remains coherent. Strong verbs (“flared,” “spilled,” “loosening”) propel without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Doomsday inspector + guilt-activated pearl + confession-etched fossil synthesizes into fresh moral tech. Risk of magical object is earned by grounding in widower’s lived guilt and Mara’s occupational pivot. Transformation test fails if swapped: only a bunker inspector could credibly unseal a shelter. Specificity makes trope new.</comment>
