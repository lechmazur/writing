<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass ritual give a tactile, idiosyncratic core; the “awkwardly confident” trait shows in micro-choices (laughing at shaking hands, stepping onto stones). Interiority stays concrete—teeth singing, bones aligning—without diagnostic labels. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits stealth, stands exposed on the stones, letting thunder speak for her—Earned Stasis under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the console’s answering pulse and printed “keep” reconfigure the rebellion’s silence into coordinated motion; Ilya’s barefoot stillness on the humming circle makes the cost bodily and immediate. Causality holds—every beat from hum-mapping to transmission grows from prior tactile discovery. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (dead docks, oily gusts) pays off when the circle’s hum anchors spatial and temporal logic at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s cold plating, unpowered shuttle, and cracked skylight filter through Ilya’s barefoot sensitivity, constraining her pacing and seating choice on the stones. The opera glasses and stone circle function as micro-setting objects that literally tune the transmission; their material states (brass scars, rivets quivering) charge the final image. Weather and rotation are tracked precisely, tightening the dawn-deadline clock. No caps triggered; environment shapes tactics and final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“break the lull or surrender meaning”—is signaled by the silent bay and Sael’s notebook. Escalation is one deepening: hum → coordinates → transmission; the tightening narrows options from passive listening to active beacon. Cost is visible: exposure on the stones, possible Directorate triangulation. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word scope; one meaningful tightening meets the bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: meaning is not found but transmitted—rebellion as resonance across broken things. The stones’ answer reframes prior wreckage into circuitry; “reignite” is instruction, not slogan. Final image of barefoot Ilya on live stone reweights barefoot vulnerability into antenna-strength—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in opera glasses (once judgment, now navigation) quietly underscores the shift from observation to participation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, mirroring Ilya’s stargazer remove while granting sensorial immediacy (“teeth gently singing”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with hum cadence; diction stays within her lexicon without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature—barefoot cold, brass scars, interval counting—held consistently under pressure. Patterned elision (“the bay remained serene”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose carries high density: “thunder rolled over the dead docks” fuses weather, sound, and mortality in six words. Metaphors stay coherent—thunder as drummer, stones as circuitry—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“the prayers were over, the leaders jailed or fled”) but it serves as caesura, not clutter. No artifacts touch the final beat; rhythm modulates toward the closing single-sentence paragraph that crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of stone-circle megalithic tech with decrepit spaceport feels fresh; rebel network routed through acoustic resonance rather than encrypted data is a non-obvious tactical twist. Opera glasses repurposed as sextant and barefoot grounding as antenna are specific, irreplaceable inflections. Transformation test fails if swapped: the hum’s tactile bone-conduction wouldn’t translate to generic communicator. Risk in lyric stillness heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
