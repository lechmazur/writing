<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer trait is embodied through the refusal of torchlight and the fingertip compass balancing—micro-choices that cost time and risk exposure. Interiority stays concrete (“lungs tighten,” “kept the sky in mind”) and the final act of planting the point is a credibly cautious rebellion. The mentor’s transparent presence is accepted without explanatory padding, letting the protagonist’s steady-handed fear drive every beat. No label-speak intrudes at peak pressure, so the arc earns its renunciation with visible tremor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: driving the compass point into the seam permanently rewrites the nexus’s spatial rule-set and frees the mentor, cost paid in the widening night that now “keeps the stars from touching the earth.” Causal linkage holds—each organ note triggers a floor slide, the compass rotates to force exits, and the final spin of the lock is contingent on the protagonist’s quiet refusal. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when shelves realign with breathing. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the snapped-off blueprint point is the same tool that drafts the new path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nexus is rendered through tactile navigation—“step only on notes that rang clean,” “ring of compressed corridors that clenched like ribs”—so environment literally squeezes tactics. The suspended shelves-over-void image is re-anchored to bodily stakes when aisles widen or narrow with inhalation, charging the final image of a stable path back under starlight. No exposition dumps; world rules are learned by action and the compass’s tremor. Spatial choreography remains coherent across hinge-walls and spiral stairs that sometimes ladder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lost key or remain complicit in spatial tyranny—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when corridors vote to fold the protagonist into an airless closet. The decisive turn narrows options: plant the compass and risk permanent lung-seal, or retreat; the chosen path forecloses the nexus’s mutiny and costs the mentor’s corporeal form. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens—each organ interval raises floor-shift stakes—culminating in the single trembling chord that snaps the prison ribs. Price is visible in the transparent dust the mentor becomes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—maps must be redrawn by those who once feared them—emerges from the protagonist’s fingertip draft and the final image of “room for new maps drawn by those who dared, prudently, to change the shape of home.” No explicit thesis; the lock spinning without a door reweights consent as the true key. Subtext lives in the organ’s delayed echo arguing with the nexus, implying that even ruined systems can negotiate space. The ending’s wistful rebellion lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise perceptual signature—starlight as the only bearable roof, distances that “argue,” doorways that “vote”—and modulates from wary compression to quiet insurgency without ever slipping into head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“cathedral turned inside out”) then shortens under risk (“Space gave way with a grudging sigh”), mirroring breathing stakes. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the explorer’s plausible lexicon while still sounding wrought. The final line’s cadence releases the held chord without forced uplift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds next causal trigger (“Each chord marked an interval before the floor slid sideways”)—and rhythm varies from organ-held legato to staccato gasp. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop detected (“the vital key was not metal but consent” restated as “the key was the compass point itself”) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Pronouns, tense, and spatial tracking remain clean throughout hinge-walls and spiral shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The spatial-mutiny premise fuses cartography with sentient architecture in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen; the compass fragment drafting new exits literalizes the metaphor of drawing one’s own map. Risk is taken by letting the mentor reappear as dust-wisp without explanatory scaffolding, trusting the emotional reconfiguration to carry wonder. No stock frontier tropes survive intact—towns sleep “between harvests and wars,” the archive rearranges like a “brain forgetting and remembering.” The final image of frontier towns waking to re-shapeable space offers fresh cultural resonance rather than manifest destiny.</comment>
