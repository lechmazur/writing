<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motive is clear—map the vanishing paths—and the crater-glass micro-choices (tongue test, pulse test) embody the occupation. Interiority is lush yet consistent; the broken-promise twist gives Mira credible contradiction and cost. The narrator’s own flaw (smug “cheerful gloom”) is asserted more than dramatized, muting the final renunciation’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: missing path → seed trail → geode door → confession → ridge restored. Each beat tightens options under the Causal lens. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—the ridge re-appears, Mira’s shame is spoken, narrator’s tool is scratched forever. Orientation is taught by word 80; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode, crater glass, and foam pool are not backdrop; they supply the only means to test and repair emotional routes. Crystal doorway that refuses reflection physically forces self-confrontation. Sensory selection stays filtered through POV’s salt-stained patience. Final ridge “shimmering into being” recharges every prior visual motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will erased paths return?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates because each clue (seeds, glass, pool) narrows the solution to a single act: spoken apology. Cost is legible: Mira’s public confession, the spiral scar on the shard. No coincidence resolves; bird seeds complicate, then deliver the last push.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—emotional routes maintain geography—emerges through geode metaphysics rather than statement. Subtext of withheld apology vs. physical erasure is dramatized in the empty facet and the gap on the shard. Final image of ridge “shimmering into being” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity remains: some other paths stay lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct: salt-patience, “cheerful gloom,” synesthetic blues that “laugh in mourning clothes.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, tightens under dread; no head-hop. Crater-glass transliteration jargon is introduced through bodily act (tongue), keeping lexicon anchored. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext when Mira’s apology is spoken to foam, not to person.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances mystery or image. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“sea-foam recollectionist” lands). One scaffold loop: “paths disappear…paths disappear” within 30 words, but it occurs early and does not recur. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“coax,” “etch,” “shimmer”) drive motion. Final beat is clean of figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses magical realism with emotional geography; not a trope checklist. Crater glass as emotion-Ouija feels fresh yet inevitable once tongue-test is shown. Vanishing ridge as consequence of broken promise reverses expected erosion logic. Risky second-person address to reader (“you laughed”) is brief and earns its place by undercutting narrator’s smugness.</comment>
