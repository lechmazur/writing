<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lysa’s interiority is concrete—she “listens with her hands,” carves to match crack-patterns, smiles at bone-felt vibration—so her symphonic need drives every micro-choice. The only slack is the off-page plan to carry silence-music to neighbors; it’s told, not embodied, so the arc’s final cost is slightly blunted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each added wire tightens the grove’s silent chord until the porcelain moon image reweights the premise with felt cost—she leaves the insulator behind, foreclosing retrieval. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric accumulation rather than because/therefore, and the final Charged Poise lands clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Alder bend, wire tension, hedgehog pause, porcelain coolness—every tactile detail is filtered through Lysa’s haptic musicianship and constrains her next move. The grove’s micro-setting (body, tool, wire) literally supplies the only “instrument” possible; the final porcelain moon hanging in space crystallizes the reconfigured grove.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—tightens via each wire pluck that costs her carved alder block and bodily stillness. One meaningful deepening suffices: the widest crack becomes the opening note, narrowing options to physical empathy; price is visible in surrendered insulator and perpetual silence she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through touch: unheard grief can be shared haptically if someone keeps “moving toward” it. No moralizing—final porcelain moon silently reweights earlier telegraph longing into communal possibility, leaving resonant ambiguity about whether the settlement will ever listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lysa’s haptic synesthesia; diction (“sap rises,” “moving rests on a staff”) is musician-specific. Rhythm swells and subsides with wire tension; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; final image of porcelain moon is voiced with crystalline certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathy accumulations to single-word beats (“She plucks.”), propelling the silent crescendo. Only minor scaffold: two near-adjacent “crack-patterns / crack-patterns” could compress, but figurative control holds; no mixed metaphors dull the final vibration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic silence rendered as haptic symphony is fresh; stress-cracks read as musical intervals, porcelain insulator reborn as bridge—specific synthesis, not trope check-list. Risky quiet ending commits fully; transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
