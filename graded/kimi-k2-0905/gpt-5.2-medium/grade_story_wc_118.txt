<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa’s perceptual sensitivity is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—chipping mortar, pinning the tapestry—so her historian’s mission feels embodied. The final renunciation (“no one could set it back”) is earned by the concrete cataloguing ritual and carries visible cost in the bronze-quiet pinning. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. She is the only on-page agent, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; her flaw—accepting irreparability—drives the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lysa’s pinning of the tapestry re-orients the library’s meaning under a new north; cost is the irrevocable loss of the dream-axis, felt in the final wind-pressed metal skin. Causality is accumulative/textural: each diary/tapestry beat thickens the pattern until the axis-shift becomes undeniable. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“reclaimed silo library at the edge…”). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The silo’s concrete skin, hearth mouth, and window slit constrain every move—mortar must be chipped, sun must angle through the slit to cast dragon shadows that crawl toward the hearth, charging the final image. Smoke-scent and bronze dust are selective, POV-filtered, and guide Lysa’s attention. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating objects. The tapestry fragment as micro-setting directly shapes the closure pin, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve witness of the axis-shift—tightens when each diary entry forecloses denial; the final pinning is the irrevocable trade-off. Pressure is textural: curled black edges, cedar-panic smell, dragon shadows crawling toward the hearth escalate density. No coincidence; escalation is driven by Lysa’s probing agency. Cost is legible: she abandons restoration for memorialization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of burnt pages and dragon threads: memory becomes compass once dreams die. Subtext lives in gesture—pinning the fragment is a quiet declaration that maps now hang on loss, not recovery. No moralizing; the wind-pressed metal skin offers ambiguous resonance. The displaced axis reweights every prior artifact without abstract sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lens stays tight to Lysa’s perceptual syntax: “felt vibrations as if they were sentences,” “bronze dust,” “concrete remembered the loom’s rhythm.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for slow listening, clipped fragments at the pin. No head-hopping; diction stays within her antiquarian lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; voice sustains singularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“silence settled like bronze dust,” “shadows… like searching animals”—and paid off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, character, and theme work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-dream axis-shift is fresh; using a half-burnt tapestry fragment as compass needle is specific and non-obvious. The library-in-a-silo repurposes familiar post-apocalypse tropes into a quiet archival ritual. Risk: lyrical stillness instead of action climax, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if dragons or silo are swapped—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
