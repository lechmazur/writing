<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nara’s insurgent past and refusal to repeat implanted destiny give her a sharp, evolving motive; her decision to speak her story into the steam is a micro-choice that costs her the certainty of control. The salamander’s transformation validates her intent, showing earned change. Interiority stays concrete (“laughed once, surprised”) and avoids label-speak. One beat short of 9: we don’t feel the bodily cost of her final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the embryo becomes a salamander gardener, rewriting destiny as chosen service. Causal chain—kite script → decoded heat-silence steps → salamander imprint—lands with Nara’s visible price: she surrenders omniscience for uncertain co-creation. Drive lens is Causal; every beat tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic springs constrain every ritual move (burned palms, sulfur bubbles) and charge the final image: salamander crawls toward garden beds, literalizing “reconstruction.” Steam curtains, tamarisk relief, and lichen warnings are filtered through the narrator’s plant-telepathy, keeping detail character-bound. Micro-setting (black rock slope) doubles as altar. One hairline slip: “abandoned kite” appears late yet pays off instantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the embryo re-implant destiny?—tightens when the kite script warns of first-will imprint. Nara’s agency escalates via decoding, staging the unsealing, and speaking intent, each step raising the cost of failure. Salamander’s choice to tend gardens is the irreversible narrowing. Felt price: Nara trades prophetic power for humble ecology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: tradition is a tool, not a script; destiny must be chosen and life must serve repair. Subtext lives in gestures—tight braid, burned palms, salamander heading for vegetables. Final image reweights the opening “stone roads over ash” as living repair, not erasure. No moralizing; resonance is organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a calm, insurgent texture (“gray hair braided tight, as if every strand still carried coded orders”) distinct from Nara’s terse authority. Plant-telepathy diction stays vegetal—thirst, sunlight, punctuation of reeds—without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for steam, staccato for decoding. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “amber clouded, unsealed along a seam like a mouth opening” does image + action + stakes in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors are coherent (mouth, drum, curtain). Final line cadence mirrors kite-flight release, giving sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing insurgent eco-fantasy with biopunk destiny crystals feels fresh; the salamander-gardener oracle is an inversion that grows logically from prior rules. Risk—replacing prophetic baby with humble amphibian—pays off thematically and emotionally. Specificity of moss memory and reed punctuation prevents generic substitution. Transformation is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
