<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—hush the prophecy before factions weaponize it—stays legible, and her final choice to filter rather than erase carries cost. Interiority is evocative (“private current inside her”) yet drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“understood why the factions wanted it”) that blurs contradiction in-scene. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices (drawing silence intervals, pressing wing to water) are concrete and value-laden. The endurance of carrying the warning alone is credible, but the absence of embodied fear or second-guess in the decisive beat keeps the arc just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is neutralized into “blank petals,” the city still ignorant, Liora left with sole custody of the warning—cost is the burden of knowledge and future risk. Causal chain holds: lure of prophecy → mapping silence → filter choice → wing absorbs code → snowfall erasure. Orientation is swift: “nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook” anchors who/where inside 30 words. One minor elasticity: the instant mental appearance of the “missing half” is un-set-up, but it does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Brook, alder shadows, and reed-paper wing are tactile and filtered through Liora’s ritual attention; mist beading on the origami is micro-setting at its best. The “terrestrially cosmic stones” phrase risks overwriting but is grounded when the stones literally ground the dissolved crane-snowfall, tying environment to closure. Spatial clarity is maintained in a single location; weather (mist, dawn) evolves with action. The circle of wet lines finally read as “children’s play” reweights the setting after stakes pass, meeting the 9+ gate for environmental charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent weaponized prophecy—tightens when Liora discovers the wells are already cracking, forcing a filter-not-erase tactic. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each mapping of silence physically encircles the threat, narrowing options toward one irreversible act. The final cost is conceptual—she alone must speak plainly to a city that may not listen—but the on-page price (loss of anonymity, psychic burden) is only lightly felt in the moment, keeping the beat just outside the 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethics of selective silence—whether truth is kinder when muted. Subtext lives in gesture (wing darkens as code drains) and in the brook’s final refusal to repeat itself. No character moralizes; the snowfall of blank petals is an open image that invites reflection on mercy versus complicity. The thematic question lingers unresolved, satisfying the complexity criterion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Liora’s perceptual filter: she notices intervals between cricket calls, reads ripples with fingertips—idiosyncratic, not touristic. Syntax lengthens during ritual, then compresses at dawn (“they found only a brook…”), mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) is borderline but consistent with the character’s arcane vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: one sentence often does two jobs (“She pressed the crane’s origami wing to the water, and it drank the remaining code”). Metaphors are mostly coherent; only “tranquil blaze” risks oxymoron but is justified by gauze-hearth image. No loops or scaffold detected; rhythm modulates without algorithmic repetition. A single filter-verb cluster (“seemed to lean closer to hear nothing”) is minor enough to leave 9+ bands open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Ritualized silence-as-magic, prophecy encoded in bird-names, and origami as data-storage synthesize into a fresh conceptual cocktail. The premise could slide into abstraction, but concrete handling (ash-sealed fold, interval mapping) keeps it grounded. Final snowfall of blank petals reweights earlier cosmic hint into quiet apotheosis—an image unlikely to be mistaken for another story. Risk is present but controlled, meriting upper-band originality.</comment>
