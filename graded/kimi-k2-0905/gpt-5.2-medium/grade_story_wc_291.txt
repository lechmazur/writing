<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The face-blind artist’s methodical nature is dramatized through calipers, ledger, and the act of drawing contradictions into a composite face; interior contradiction surfaces when empathy is claimed yet complicity in “looking away” is admitted. Micro-choices—spreading tools, stepping forward with the pencil—show agency under pressure. The final offer to paint the lost dancers crystallizes a moral stance with visible social cost, satisfying earned change. Minor slip: Maren’s twitch is read with implausible certainty by a face-blind narrator, a POV stretch that nicks credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ribbon → sketch → quarry visit → confrontation → confession, each step narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change: Maren’s admission rewrites town memory and the narrator’s offer forecloses silence with public grief. Cost is legible—“shoulders sag” and the impending civic mural—under a single Causal lens. One causality bump: the courthouse trash timing and shredder identity are elided, a convenience that keeps evidence from police but not from artist, slightly softening motive force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Wine-red ribbon, pond-water scent, and double-knot detail anchor early; quarry mist and tin-roof shed constrain movement and hide bodies. The ribbon’s stagehand knot later enables the narrator to infer quick-release costume, directly shaping the accusation. Spatial choreography stays clean across the shed: lance on wall, matching ribbon strip, Maren’s throat-touch tracked without drift. Micro-setting (ribbon, lance) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though broader town geography remains sketch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening town empathy by naming the lost—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when procedural silence is threatened. Mid-story pivot: sketch of the masked figure forces Maren’s twitch, turning abstract guilt into imminent exposure. Final offer of a public mural forecloses anonymity for both Maren and town, exacting social cost. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under Causal lens; no reversal or deepening beyond the single turn, capping short-form excellence at 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from unifying opposites—cruelty/care, blindness/insight—until guilt and grief must co-exist publicly. Subtext lives in gesture: Maren’s practiced kindness shatters into broken-glass laugh, revealing rehearsed innocence. Final image of a civic portrait reweights the premise: art becomes communal mirror rather than private avoidance. No moralizing statement; resonance is earned through the narrator’s offer and Maren’s sagging shoulders, leaving ambiguous whether empathy or mere shame will follow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a methodical cadence—ledger, calipers, column/row—that mirrors the narrator’s perceptual limits. Selective noticing (scent of pond water, double knot) stays inside face-blind bias. Compression in lines like “lance the air with my pencil tip” fuses action and metaphor without breaking idiom. One minor wobble: the simile “laugh like broken glass” is repeated by both Sato and narrator, blurring perceptual ownership, but the pattern is taught early enough to read as thematic echo rather than slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; high information density—each clause adds tool, scent, or contradiction. No synonym loops or scaffold; “ribbon” reappears with accruing meaning rather than repetition fatigue. Metaphors (broken glass, mason’s plumb) stay consistent with narrator’s mechanical mindset. One mixed vehicle: “furrowed hush” is tactile + auditory, but the compression is brief and voice-motivated, not muddling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind portraitist solving cold case by drawing contradictions—is fresh, fully committed, and specific to this voice. Ribbon-as-clue and stage-knot mechanics transform familiar “missing dancers” trope into procedural-poetic hybrid. Risk of experimental empathy-artist is balanced by concrete ledger method, avoiding gimmick. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
