<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The scribe’s contradictory hunger for sound and self-punishing silence is embodied in micro-choices—tearing the ledger, wrapping the paw—each a tactile refusal of his former vow. The final renunciation (“I could bear the longing honestly”) is earned by these prior acts and carries visible cost: the bell dream is relinquished on the page. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; even the epiphany is delivered as physical warmth soaking through wool. The bear functions as pressure, not symbol, forcing the hierarchy of values to shift in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forecourt’s mute pulses become a score the protagonist will keep composing, reconfiguring silence from wound to instrument. Causality holds—every beat (quartz murmur, paw wound, ledger strip) tightens options until the sunrise line crystallizes the new stance. Cost is legible in the torn margin and the explicit forfeiture of bells. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stone, cedar, lichen, and quartz are filtered through an ex-clockmaker’s eye—gear-care motion describes the bear-bandaging, not generic tenderness. The wet forecourt constrains the final choice: its mineral pulse supplies the “score” that replaces bells. Weather is not backdrop; the pre-dawn hush enables the illicit outing and the auditory hallucination. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from desk to forecourt to ridge line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into music without bells?—is signaled in paragraph one. The bear’s wound forces a single decisive tightening: the ledger page is sacrificed, making future chart-copying impossible and committing the scribe to raw listening. Escalation is accumulative: each stone-felt vibration deepens the cost of clinging to muteness. The final stance crystallizes under undeniable pressure: the glacier still looms, but the forecourt now demands a new, bell-less composition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the impossibility of holding time still is accepted, yet the need to honor its passage remains. Subtext lives in gesture—tearing blank paper is a louder break with monastic obedience than any spoken vow. The quartz “song” reweights earlier nostalgia without moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity: the sunrise colors silence, but does not dissolve it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>First-person syntax mimics escapement ticks—long sentences coil, then release in short beats (“I tore a strip”). Perceptual signature is gear-maker precise: “split by a shard of glassy ice” diagnoses like a loupe inspection. No filter-verb clutter; physical sensations arrive direct. Compression (“the glacier pressed down on the valley”) teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off in the final fire-line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during the bear approach, then lengthens for the shared stillness, mirroring respiratory fear. Metaphors stay mechanical—stone murmurs, clocks refuse to ring—keeping the POV’s diction coherent. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Only hairline slip: “petrichor nostalgia” edges toward label, but is immediately embodied by throat-tightening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines cloister quietism with wildlife surgery and lithic music—an unlikely triad made inevitable by the clockmaker’s tactile logic. The bear is not magical helper but random glacier casualty, preserving situational realism. Fresh inflection: silence becomes compositional notation without a single bell rung. Risk is high—lyric stillness could flatten—but pressure stays acute through the bleeding paw and torn ledger.</comment>
