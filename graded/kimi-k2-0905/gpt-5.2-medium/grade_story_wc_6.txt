<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—inheritance of fire-setting blood vs. life-saving vocation—are dramatized in the shack rescue where she sees her father in the boy yet re-enters anyway. Micro-choices (coin swing for breath-timing, field graft) embody “unyielding compassion” under literal fire. The final coin-swap shows earned change: she externalizes the talisman into a message, accepting public scrutiny rather than private talismanic protection—cost is the surrender of anonymity. Voice stays concrete; only minor over-articulation (“prove that scars can sing”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: father’s arson → daughter’s firefighter identity → copycat uses coin → narrator reframes legacy by leaving coin as communal message. Each beat tightens options: accelerant fuse forces entry, beam pins girl, graft buys time, coin evidence threatens reputation, final gesture forecloses secrecy. Closure is Earned Stasis: she sacrifices the private charm to public trust, cost legible in the tied coin now exposed. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Black sand, obsidian lagoon, kelp ribbons, rescue post—each tactile detail doubles as decision tool or emotional mirror. Sand judges wind, lagoon offers false calm after blaze, coin on post re-weights setting into moral arena. Environment constrains graft timing and later frames the ethical reconfiguration. Micro-setting (burned beam, drilled coin) functions as embodied geography; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she outrun her father’s shadow while living the opposite vocation. Escalation: brush call → accelerant evidence → trapped sister → graft under fire → coin framing → public vulnerability. Each step raises personal cost: bodily risk, moral compromise, reputational peril. Final choice narrows future: open identification as “compassion answer,” foreclosing anonymity—price paid on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt vs. chosen grace emerges through fire imagery and coin circulation; no explicit thesis. Subtext: the copycat’s mimicry implies her father’s myth still burns, yet her graft literalizes “healing fire.” Final image—coin left for the arsonist—re-prices legacy from shame to invitation, resonance achieved without moralizing. Only withheld 0.1 for near-echo of “scars can sing” phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice fuses firefighter jargon with lyrical compression: “sky smelled wrong, sharp as kerosene and grief.” Sensory selectivity mirrors professional triage—smoke scent, beam weight, skin texture under graft. Rhythm accelerates during crawl-under-beam sequence, then exhales at lagoon calm, matching pulse of scene. No head-hop; diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, metaphor, emotional calculus—without scaffold. Figurative control consistent: “clouds migration,” “kelp-drift peace,” “black sand shining as if it could absorb every story.” No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor filter verb in “I watched the girl stare” but immediately compensated by embodied detail. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “sins of the father” trope through firefighter procedural detail and forensic coin twist. Field graft under burning beam feels fresh, grounded in wilderness-medicine realism. Coin duplication as framing device offers non-obvious escalation; legacy reframed as public message rather than private curse. Specificity of volcanic coast, drilled foreign coin, and kelp imagery renders template unrecognizable.</comment>
