<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s quietly deliberate pace and ink-stained fingers are concrete; her need to “relearn” by closing loops turns every micro-choice into a test of inherited discipline. The moment she dips her finger into the white pool, the embodied cost of rejoining her own shadow is legible and irreversible. Interior contradiction is present—curiosity against inherited dread—yet the mentor’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage, capping the crucible at 8.9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each rune-circle she completes tightens the next option until the final loop re-stitches noon to its shadows. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“floating isle of Vey”), stakes are signaled by word 60 (“where shadows go at noon”), and the closure beat—her shadow re-attached—carries a felt conceptual cost under the glass pool. No teleporting props; the automaton’s double role as key and traveler is set up by the “sealed awakenings” rule. Closure is a Decisive Change with persistent constraint: the world’s sun-beam is now circular, a price that shapes future noon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory’s star-maps, iron-and-tea corridor, and suspended mirrors function as micro-settings that force her to see herself minus different shadows, directly shaping the final choice. The chalk ring, brass automaton, and glass pool are tools that constrain tactics; removing any would break the loop logic. Sensory hierarchy obeys her scholar priorities: ink, chalk dust, cold tea, the click of clockwork. Spatial choreography is clean—she climbs, kneels, traces, dips—every motion causally linked to the next beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and escalates through each closed loop that forecloses a linear path. The midpoint tightening occurs when the mural peels open, revealing the reservoir; options narrow from inquiry to responsibility. Cost is visible: she permanently re-couples her own shadow to the world’s broken sun-cycle. One causal reversal: the automaton becomes traveler instead of tool, forcing her to trust the loop rather than force it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges: knowledge is not accumulated but returned, cycles not lines. The spoon-bent world literalizes this; shadows stored under glass re-weight the moral calculus of daylight itself. No moralizing—final image is her climbing out while the reservoir sighs, leaving the reader to feel the cost of restored noon. Subtext in the automaton’s “sealed awakening” quietly asks who is being awakened—world, mentor, or scholar—without declaring an answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Liora’s perceptual filter: she notices ink, chalk click, iron scent, missing shadows. Syntax mirrors her quietly deliberate trait—measured clauses, no frantic fragments until the final dip. No head-hopping; the mentor is memory only. Diction remains within rune-scholar lexicon without sliding into faux-archaic; “hinge rune backward” is precise, plausible jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative control is disciplined—“noon fell like water… like stone” sets the physics break early, never repeated. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ascent, staccato clicks for the automaton, quiet final clause as reservoir sighs. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; information density stays high without purple compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent sun that circularizes shadows into a glass reservoir is a conceptual leap that feels inevitable once the loop rule is taught. Rune-circles as epistemic method fuses magic and scholarship in a way that generic portal fantasy avoids. Risk is high—entire cosmology altered in 700 words—yet every beat grows from the premise without late rule patches. Specificity of the brass child-key and the iron-tea smell anchors abstraction in tactile memory.</comment>
