<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maelin’s exhaustion and refusal to be prophecy’s pawn are viscerally embodied; her decision to enter the fissure crystallizes a hierarchy of values (sleep over sovereignty) with visible soot-and-blood cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for rest yet gripping power—remains active in-scene, not abstract. The final renunciation is earned because every beat has shown her sickened by awe and menace alike. Minor slip: “softly commanding” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the dream bleeds, therefore she climbs; because she climbs, she must choose inside the grotto. Closure is a Decisive Change—she cauterizes the star and forfeits the crown-prop—cost is legible in the cooled embers and the “plain night” that now frightens her. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the bleeding thread drops, forcing the final exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt grotto’s mineral glow, ash-and-violet scent, and crown-shaped ember ring are not postcard scenery—they funnel Maelin toward the fissure and mirror her internal cut. Body-as-setting works: soot on gloves, heat through leather constrain her grip and timing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the ledge, rope, lantern. The “ordinary” sky at the end reweights all prior shimmer; environment directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stop the bleeding sky or rule by stolen starlight—signaled in paragraph 1 and narrowed to an explicit either/or inside the grotto. One decisive reversal: the voice’s offer crystallizes the cost, forcing her climb-down into the seam. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. The forfeiture of the crown-prop is a visible price that alters the political horizon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: sovereignty bought on borrowed starlight is toxic sleep. The bleeding star reconfigures from omen to temptation to self-inflicted wound; lace motif shifts from courtly menace to strangling seduction. Final plain sky re-prices power as emptiness. No moralizing sentence intrudes. Ambiguity lingers: a kingdom may still fall, but the choice is now hers alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maelin’s perceptual filter—she notices shale, scent, heat, not geopolitics. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens during the climb; velvet-over-glass voice is sensed, not labeled. No head-hopping; Rovan’s interior is implied only through her reading of his wrist. Diction remains within her court-poised lexicon; “lace around a throat” carries her civilized menace into the wild.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense yet each image (bleeding thread, crown-ring hiss) advances stakes or sensation. One mixed-metaphor risk—“polite and persistent as lace around a throat”—survives because it fuses temptation with suffocation, on-theme. No paraphrase loops; information density high. Proof: “soot-streaked and steady” condenses ordeal into four words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of prophetic dream is inverted: the dream is not destiny but bait, the star not oracle but wound. Specificity—cobalt mineral glow, ash-violet scent, crown-shaped ember—prevents generic “dark cave.” Risk taken: queen abdicates power to close a sky-wound, a choice rarely dramatized. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; removal of any sensory particular would collapse the mood.</comment>
