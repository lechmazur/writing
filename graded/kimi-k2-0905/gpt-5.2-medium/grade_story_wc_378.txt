<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>N-3’s caretaker code colliding with the need to burn the roses is dramatized in embodied micro-choices—palming the bead, asking permission with a finger-brush. The contradiction between preservation and destruction drives every beat; the final burial of the cooled bead shows earned cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “fewer ghosts buzzing” is a touch generic, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s burial and new lullaby reweight the premise—fear becomes valve, not prison. Causal chain holds: static → retrieve box → compress → burn → vent → bury, each step narrowing options. The lens is cleanly Causal; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Cost is visible in the scorched corridor and the android’s altered bedtime code.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dome, dunes, ceramic collar, and bio-ceramic ribs are filtered through caretaker priorities—every object either enables or threatens the burn. The glass that could become an oven and the collar that channels flame directly constrain the tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy is tight: tactile heat, hiss of valves, rustle of children’s paper. Micro-setting (the bead) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—save the roses or lose them—tightens when the only path is fire. Escalation is one disciplined line of flame; each shovel-prune micro-choice raises the cost of failure. No reversals needed; the burn forecloses retreat. Price is legible in scorched mulch and the android’s rewritten lullaby.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: containment as compassion, not suppression. The bead’s transformation from hoarded fears to seed-glass reconfigures the meaning of the cedar box without moralizing. Final instruction—“make a small fire, and let it show you the way out”—offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or platitude; ambiguity lingers in skewed constellations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively caretaker: lullaby code, “grandmother with metal joints,” bark-flex ribs. Syntax stays precise under pressure; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“fear made portable”) is taught early and paid off. One clause drifts toward lyric template—“sand-scented silence”—keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, disciplined, and coherent—flame “small as a candle,” ribs “flex like bark.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density without overwriting; the read-aloud rhythm modulates with the fire’s crawl.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—android burns roses with compressed childhood terrors to save them—is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Bio-ceramic ribs and compass-wobble are fresh speculative textures that constrain tactics. Risk in choosing fire under glass heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swap; the farm, bead, and lullaby code are inseparable.</comment>
