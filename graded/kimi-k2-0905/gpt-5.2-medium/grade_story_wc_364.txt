<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s quiet determination is embodied in every micro-choice (trading memory for silk, hammering rods underground); the amnesia-cost sequence credibly thins his identity while sharpening resolve. The final refusal to keep the silk shows earned renunciation, though the mother-name blank is named once rather than felt in scene, slightly blunting emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: falling arches → silk bargain → memory-for-knowledge trades → forge anchors → arch steadied → silk buried. Each beat tightens options under a visible price; closure lands as Earned Stasis—Lio forecloses further barter, empty-eyed yet unbowed—cost legible in the buried silk and hollowed memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, bruised-fruit soil, and lantern-lit mine ribs are filtered through Lio’s tactile blacksmith gaze; every descriptor doubles as resource or threat. The silk’s blue glow against stone “like a sleeping eye” reappears at closure when the arch underside “glowed like dawn through leaves,” recharging the image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save orchards before arches collapse—escalates through each memory-payment, narrowing Lio’s toolkit as he forgets songs, faces, his mother’s name. Protagonist agency drives every turn: he chooses the trade, chooses the forge, chooses to bury the silk; coincidence merely enables the magician’s arrival without solving the problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resilience-as-craft emerges organically: the story refrains from moralizing, letting the image of a hollowed man steadying stone with self-forged ribs carry the thematic weight. The final quiet—“new names he would someday deserve”—reweights the premise: memory loss is the price of planetary repair, an ambiguous victory that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays locked to Lio’s perceptual filter—iron scent, lantern flicker, stone warmth—syntax tightening as memory erodes. No head-hopping; magician’s dialogue is sparse, indirection-rich (“awakenings on Pomaria were never free”), distinct from Lio’s hushed interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is compressed and rhythmic, almost every sentence advancing stakes or texture: “he shaped it into azure defiance, a calm blue flame.” One paraphrase loop (“memory loosen, slipping into confusion…like a fruit you taste only after it is gone”)轻度重复 but does not stall momentum or touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The memory-for-stone barter reframes standard “hero fixes world” arcs into a quiet artisan horror; floating-arch orchard + mine-root mechanics feel specific rather than checklist-fantasy. Risk lies in the lyric ellipsis of memory loss, paid off by the hollowed yet steadying final image.</comment>
