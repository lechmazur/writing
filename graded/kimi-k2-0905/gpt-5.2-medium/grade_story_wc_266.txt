<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s shame-to-courage shift is embodied in trembling hands and the loosened leash; the contradictory impulses (run/stay) coexist in scene. The dog as mirror works, yet the guides remain symbolic furniture—no interior contradiction or status friction is granted to them, so relationship-as-crucible is nil. Closure is earned: she holds the leash loosely, a visible cost paid for the earlier choke. Still, the guides’ instant benevolence softens the flaw-compounding that high-band entries require.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: shoreline lullaby, star punches, and swallowed footprints accrete until the final loosened leash reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—shingle, fog, tide line by line 4. The vigil beat deepens pattern rather than tightens causal chain, but the final image of the lighter, star-perforated fare delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. One minor scaffold: “keeps breathing…keeps humming…keeps singing” creates template cadence, yet it never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Sea-fog, scree, bracken thicket—each micro-setting constrains movement and supplies the wire that traps the dog. The ticket punch’s star-shaped bite literally alters the physical world (cuts wire) and symbolically reconfigures courage, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices lantern swing before she notices map-like eyes. No geography drift; spatial choreography from tide line to ridge to hollow is trackable step for step.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the dog, confront her own fear—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each star punch lightens the fare and deepens her obligation to act; the vigil delays action to let fear ripen. The wire entanglement is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Cost is visible—frayed paper, bleeding time, trembling hands—but the guides’ magic cushion prevents the full 8.8+ price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “courage found in corners, not straight roads” emerges from the indirect sheep tracks and the star-punched fare, never sermonized. The shoreline lullaby reprises as an internal metronome, reweighted when she trusts her own steps rather than the leash. Final image—loose leash, dog leaning in—offers Charged Poise without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: the guides’ maps still unread, the channel still secret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: “eyes hold maps that do not look like maps” is exactly what a frightened non-seafarer would think. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, shortens during descent, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the lyric cadence is earned and pattern-taught early. One micro-template: “keeps breathing…keeps humming” is the only drumbeat, but it does not contaminate the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does setting + metaphor + interiority (“the sea keeps breathing a shoreline lullaby, and in that sound she hears the quiet part of herself that always waits”). Metaphors stay coherent—star punch = constellation = wire cutter. Only loop is the triple “keeps —ing” anaphora; it stalls momentum for one beat but never recurs near closure. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp anchors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ferry guides who issue star-punched tickets across a fog-channel feels mythic yet grounded in coastal folklore; the punch-cutter repurposing is a fresh tactical turn. The “indirect routes” device converts a self-help bromide into lived topography. While the lost-dog quest is familiar, the accretive star pattern and the vigil-in-twilight concept reconfigure it. Risk is present—lyric delay could have flattened tension—but the closure justifies the gamble.</comment>
