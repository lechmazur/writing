<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ira’s interior contradiction—paycheck vs. childhood—surfaces early and drives every beat; the final offer to Vell crystallizes it with visible cost (her exhaustion, the city’s drift). Embodied emotion is lean but present: “hope rise and panic chase it” anchors the chip moment. Dual allegiance is dramatized, not declared, through midnight tagging and daytime smiles. Competence is balanced by real jeopardy; no amnesia or label-speak. Still, the beat-to-beat micro-choices are summarized rather than rendered in scene, keeping her from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chip → graffiti → drifting blocks → moratorium. Orientation is clean within 50 words; raft-city rules stay consistent. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the city is physically reconfigured and Ira’s dual role is exposed, her exhaustion the price. The lens never wavers; no teleporting props or retro patches. One minor loop: “sell a map / protect a people” restates the stake already shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Ira’s occupational eye—she notices hand signs, mooring lines, camera blind spots—so detail never feels touristic. The carnival’s physicality (lantern flash on quartz, swing-bridge confrontation) constrains tactics: graffiti can hide under bunting, decks can be unbolted. Micro-setting (the chip, the bridge) doubles as tool and symbol. One slip: “anchor pier” vs. “foundation stone” momentarily blurs which came first, but spatial choreography stays trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—living city vs. fixed grid—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the security launch arrives. The graffiti campaign is the reversible that narrows options: each tag increases exposure risk while loosening the physical grid. Cost is visible: Ira’s fatigue, the blocks adrift at dawn, Vell’s signed moratorium under threat of chaos. No coincidence resolves; the final standoff is earned by accumulated micro-sabotage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fluidity as resistance to commodification. The closing image—stone heart cracking into many boats—reweights the opening “perpetual carnival” without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: Vell stares at “old women steering barge-homes like swans,” a silent realization that curation kills vitality. No thematic echo or final thesis line. Some abstraction in “accounts clean” weakens the conceptual bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Ira’s perceptual filter—she reads crowds, lantern reflections, rope tension. Syntax is supple, shifting from long carnival sentences to staccato night beats: “She flashed the chip… walked the decks.” No head-hopping; Vell’s realization is rendered only through observable action. One register drift: “heritage upgrades” sounds like Council brochure, not Ira’s idiom, but it appears in exposition, not interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (“translating customs so fights did not start over a wrong hand sign or song”). Occasional scaffold: “she owed… yet she owed” is deliberate parallelism, not churn. One metaphor mix: “tightrope above the music” is vivid, but “hope rise and panic chase it” borders cliché. No loops or filter stacks in the closure beat; the final mural line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The raft-city-as-organism premise feels inevitable yet fresh; the hidden quartz map turns urban planning into tactile rebellion. Graffiti as nautical code fuses art and infrastructure in a way generic resistance stories don’t. The moratorium twist—winning by making the city un-surveyable—grows from established rules rather than late gimmick. Risk taken with fluid structure pays off: the city literally reconfigures, mirroring Ira’s split loyalties.</comment>
