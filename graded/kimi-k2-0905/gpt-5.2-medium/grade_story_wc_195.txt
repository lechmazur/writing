<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calven’s guarded interiority is rendered through precise, embodied micro-choices—tracing ciphered loops, unsnapping armor in mimicry—that externalize his need to “capture possibility.” The final renunciation of his sworn silence is earned by the marionette’s heartbeat-compass and costs him his old identity; contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-belonging) play out in scene, not summary. Only the captain-voice citation flirts with label-speak, but it is immediately re-voiced as Calven’s own whisper, keeping the beat intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass needle points toward a path that “had never existed until he dared to speak it,” reweighting the entire greenhouse rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—program → cipher → marionette → seed-compass—each because/therefore linkage narrowing options until the final clasp snaps shut on a new allegiance. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse, shrouded in endless night”) and the pattern of midnight bells; no teleporting props or retro patches appear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s brass roots, leaded-glass door, and chemical rain actively constrain movement and supply the only route to the stage room; the tin-plated marionette functions as micro-setting that literally houses the compass-heart. Sensory hierarchy obeys Calven’s knight-trained attention: solvent scent, metallic warmth, spring/graves amalgam—each filtered through his tactical gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the bench, vines, stage, and sapling rows track cleanly across the single continuous scene and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—possibility itself—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when each armor clasp forecloses the old oath. The unsnapping sequence is the visible price: every loosened knot shrinks retreat until the compass seed exacts a final allegiance shift. Escalation is causal under the Accumulative lens: density of cipher echoes, chemical smells, and mirrored actions reweights cost until the greenhouse reassembles into his rewritten life-scenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the price of belonging to a living, mutable world versus a dead code of silence. Subtext lives in gesture—armor closed “not to hide, but to carry the night safely”—a quiet inversion of knightly concealment into protective stewardship. No moral is stated; the final image of saplings applauding in chemical rain reconfigures meaning without exposition, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains Calven’s perceptual signature: alchemical diction (“equations prayed,” “chemical reagent”) and compressed syntax under pressure (“shivering bliss ran over his skin”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from observational to visceral as the compass unfolds. Rhythm modulates—longer cadence for reflection, staccato for clasp releases—without template drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “a factually mystical certainty rose in him, like counting that also sings” compresses epistemology and euphoria in one image. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances setting, character, or causality. Mixed metaphors are absent; vehicles stay coherent (knots → patterns → armor → compass). One hairline slip—“spring and graves together” edges toward oxymoron—but the context justifies the alchemical fusion, so deduction is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The coin-bearing orchard, ciphered puppet theatre, and heartbeat-compass synthesize into a fresh metaphysical knight-quest that could not survive substitution. Risk-taking—lyric ellipsis, reality shifts, non-linear stage within greenhouse—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseeable, meeting the transformation test.</comment>
