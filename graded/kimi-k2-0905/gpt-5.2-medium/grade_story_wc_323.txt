<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity and pedagogical mission are clear, but her interior contradictions stay summary-level; the single dive ascent is the only beat where her body and value hierarchy collide on-page. The grief-wonder braid is asserted, not embodied. Because the decisive cost (rewriting the curriculum) happens off-page, the arc feels foreshortened. Still, her stance crystallizes and the cost is implied in the final image, satisfying the 600-word bandwidth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: probe lattice → edge geometry → surface test → curriculum rewrite, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: star-navigation becomes a civic responsibility, cost felt in “room again” grief. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (descent) is anchored. The rewrite beat is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the story just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Biolamps, basalt towers, pressure doors, and the rusted chain link create tactile micro-setting that constrains choices (no compass, only edge geometry). The surface horizon appears as a literal reconfiguration of perception, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless across the ascent. One minor slip: “citys dim halls” drops the apostrophe, but clarity survives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn star-navigation before the next alien signal—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when council grants only one tide window; failure risks civic safety. The ascent itself is the decisive test, but the actual cost (grief-wonder braid) is more lyrical than visceral, so the tightening lands at high-mid band rather than 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of expanded responsibility emerges through the chain-link-to-star-sight progression; no character moralizes. The final image—“prepare our children for unfolded horizons”—reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: curiosity as civic duty or threat. The probe’s petal-stitched starfields supply quiet cosmic awe, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: angles of rust, chord of lamp-light, triangle of stars against metal. Syntax lengthens during surface awe, then compresses on descent, mirroring pressure shift. No head-hopping; Jae remains a silent companion. Voice is distinctive yet unobtrusive, with controlled lyric elevation at the horizon reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“broken pearl,” “petals.” The single typo (“citys”) is the only artifact. Sentence variety propels the ascent without drumbeat monotony. High information density lets every line serve atmosphere or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Edge-geometry celestial navigation via a rusted chain link is a fresh, specific synthesis of hard-SF and lyric wonder. The benthic-city horizon inversion feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Tropes (alien probe, drowned world) are transformed through tactile pedagogy rather than warfare. Risk-taking is coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
