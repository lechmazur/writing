<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—survival instinct vs hunger for the ephemeral—collide in two visible micro-choices (cut/not-cut the wire, inhale the hush) that cost her last air and foreclose surface escape; embodied panic and filial memory feel specific, not diagnostic. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with a felt price.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mirror pulse releases the crew-tethered memory yet leaves Mara still thirty fathoms down with empty tank—undeniable cost on the page. Causal chain (snagged tether → unsnarling → vial release → memory bridge) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; escalation comes through density/texture, not because/therefore reversals, and is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Underwater temple, failing rebreather, and crystal vial form a micro-setting trio that constrain every move; vial warmth and thinning air charge the final inhalation beat. Sensory economy privileges touch/taste of memory over visual catalog; “furred pillars” and “silver beads” anchor POV within professional salvage bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve ephemeral memory before air runs out—tightens once when unsnarling the tether costs precious seconds and again when inhaling the hush spends final breath; both trade-offs narrow options and are legible on-page. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (wire snagged by kelp) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—humans squander ephemera and need reservoirs of shared remembrance—emerges through the hush-to-scent transfusion and mirrored pulse, never sermonized. Final image of temple settling back into lonesome splendor reweights prior mosaics of family/craft/loss without tidy moral, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature blends perfumer heritage (“molecules carrying memory”) with salvage-tech precision (“gauge hit its last trembling bars”). Rhythmic compression under asphyxiation stress feels intentional, no head-hop or filter-verb drift; diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to fragment gasps; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“harvested stillness”) is pattern-taught early and thematically motivated, never obscures causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Merging scent-memory tech with drowned temple-as-hard-drive feels fresh yet inevitable; trope of lost Atlantis is retooled into elegiac archive. Specific perfumer detail and salvage logistics prevent abstract swap-out, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
