<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s pacifist ethic is embodied in micro-choices—sheathe the rifle, kneel the father, train roses to open only for empty hands—so her values actively constrain the climax. Tarek’s softening is credibly forced by the dome’s atmosphere and the tactile talisman, not sudden benevolence. Interiority stays concrete: “roses…burned orange and white in the filtered sun” rather than abstract mercy labels. The only limit: we get no contradictory impulse from Maris in the final beat; her certainty costs nothing new, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Tarek’s rifle stays sleeved, militia withdraw, continuity is planted—cost is the bounty foregone and the father’s redefined identity, both legible on-page. Causal chain holds: because Maris engineered roses & talisman, therefore Tarek’s stance shifts; militia retreat follows that visible change. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“After the tower falls…glass dome over Maris’s rose farm”). No lens ambiguity; pattern is causal-turned-earned-stasis. Meets 9- gate except a hairline slack in militia’s off-stage compliance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dome’s heat, copper gutters, soot on glass, roses that open conditionally—every sensory note later constrains choice (rifle surrender, militia unease). The sandbag scrap recurs as talisman and window-repair canvas, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: father kneels at central bed, trucks outside, Lio emerges from water tanks—no drift. Environment literally filters violence into calm, satisfying 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the dome’s continuity survive armed retrieval?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Maris sheathes the rifle, foreclosing violent defense. One meaningful escalation: roses refuse to bloom for armed hands, forcing Tarek’s public renunciation; militia departure is consequence, not luck. Cost is the lost bounty and Tarek’s professional identity, paid on-page. Pressure stays causal; no reversal after the kneel, so just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—“quiet as living bridge against collapse”—emerges through rose-training, talisman engraving, and final planting scene; never sermonized. Subtext in bloom mechanics (community rings, thorn-mercy) reweights “pacifism” from passive to engineered resistance. Final image of planting seeds at dusk reprises continuity without moral tag. Ambiguity remains: tower still gone, council still hunting, but dome offers fragile covenant—complex yet coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Maris’s perceptual signature: “senselessly perceptive attention that seems to hear thirst before the leaves curl.” Syntax lengthens in calm, shortens under truck engines; no head-hop. Diction stays desert-earthy: “gritty boots,” “salt-stiff canvas,” avoiding lyric inflation. Father’s scoff vs. daughter’s hush creates audible contrast; dialogue sparse but subtext-loaded. Voice modulation survives peak tension, meriting 9- band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “she watched his shoulders soften as the air cooled” advances both body and atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (roses like tranquil blaze) stay consistent with dome optics. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—“she sheathed it,” “militia backed away”—propel. One mixed moment: “quiet in his palm pulled his thoughts inward the way gravity pulls sand” risks physics stretch, but pattern holds. Line-level control survives closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pacifist botanist daughter of bounty hunter is fresh angle; engineered roses that moralize through bloom mechanics transforms familiar “garden as refuge.” Sandbag-turned-talisman-turned-window-patch reuses salvage in escalating symbolic roles. Stakes stay intimate—one dome, one father—avoiding generic dystopia sprawl. Not quite 9 because core trope (post-collapse sanctuary) remains recognizable, albeit sharply particularized.</comment>
