<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her fear of her mother’s silence, her tactile use of chalk as anchor—and every micro-choice (pressing record, speaking the name) is embodied and stakes-laden. Orrin’s precognitive forgetfulness is dramatized through the looping dialogue and chalk circles, not merely labeled. The final shared breath recorded is a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses the option of ever retrieving these exact voices again. Only the mother remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is not fully tested on the page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—echoes, driftwood arrows, unwatched tapes—and holds to the last image. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira copies the layered voices onto blank videotape, turning future forgetting into a future echo; the cost is the irreversible entropic fade already audible in Orrin’s rasp. Orientation is anchored by line 30; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props. One meaningful tightening occurs when the capsule tape reveals prior strangers’ voices, reweighting the stake from private rescue to communal preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is rendered through selective synesthesia—wet halos, soundless gulls, rebar woman whose rust tastes like morning rasp—each detail filtering Mira’s attention under the project’s urgency. The shed of salt-furred videotapes and the shadow-less fog bell function as micro-settings that constrain choices (where to record, where to hide). Spatial choreography is clean: four driftwood arrows, chalk circles, puddle mirror all track without drift. The garden never throws a literal shadow, so the final image of unwatched tapes becoming future echoes is grounded in prior physical rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it vanishes”—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates when Mira realizes the archive must include Orrin’s vanishing breath. One decisive deepening: the capsule tape proves others have already lost their voices, turning private fear into communal obligation. Agency remains Mira’s: she chooses to add her mother’s name and Orrin’s breathing, paying the irreversible cost of recording over prior voices. No coincidence resolves; the tide’s turn merely externalizes the pressure already internalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of recorded ghosts: listening as the only hedge against erasure. The final image—unwatched videotapes now seeded with living breath—reweights the premise: preservation is also a slow form of loss. No character moralizes; the ethic is enacted through the tactile transfer of magnetic hush. Ambiguity lingers: the copied tapes will also be forgotten, but the act itself is the earned resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual quirks—she imagines gulls soundless, tastes rust as morning rasp. Orrin’s dialogue loops are syntactically distinct, clipped, prophetic without caricature. Compression (“precognitively forgetful, cursed to glimpse tomorrow…”) is taught early and paid off in every repeated “what are we doing?” No head-hopping; even Orrin’s rasp is filtered through Mira’s recognition. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences for tide-turn, staccato for disorientation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world rule—without overcrowding: “the magnetic hush thick as fog” conflates medium, weather, and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each driftwood arrow adds new orientation or memory slip. Metaphors stay coherent within salt-electronics domain; no mixed vehicles. Minor register elevation (“tidal longing”) is earned by prior concrete tide imagery. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the transitive verb “copy” carry the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—recording aging inside a landfill sculpture garden—synthesizes eco-entropy with personal grief without gimmick. The driftwood-map-for-memory device is fresh, yet inevitable once forgetting is made spatial. Risky structural choice to loop Orrin’s amnesia pays off as lived texture rather than gimmick. Final reconfiguration (blank tapes becoming future ghosts) feels both surprising and foreordained.</comment>
