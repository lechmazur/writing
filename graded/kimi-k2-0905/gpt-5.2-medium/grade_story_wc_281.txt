<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and warmth are embodied in micro-choices—hugging the lawyer, squeezing Jory’s hand—so motivation stays legible. The shift from doubt to “it does not matter” lands as earned stasis because the prior photo-protocol and tunnel walk dramatize the cost of listening. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, heat in ribs or cold in wrists tags belief. One minor slip: “affectionate skeptic” is never internally contradicted in a single beat, so the trait edges toward label, not lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final line “they had learned to listen for paths” crystallizes options without forcing belief, cost felt in the withheld negatives and recall threats. Causal chain holds—pill recall → somatic map → violet protocol → tunnel rescue → public exhibit—each beat narrows agency. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Harbor Street”) and never breaks. One hairline slip: the recall company’s legal leverage is asserted, not shown, so the external stakes momentarily thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ozone, clicking grid, and mica fractures are selective, tactile, and filter through Mara’s photographer gaze. The studio’s darkroom, violet wand, and muscovite lens constrain every tactical choice; the tunnel’s melted cables mirror the lattice photo, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—warehouse walk, camera sensor, hospital generator—no floating bodies. One micro-gap: the “sealed service tunnel” appears without prior environmental seed, so entrance feels slightly teleporting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy convert body-tingle “noise” into civic utility?—tightens when recall agents threaten erasure, forcing Mara to publish the protocol. The somatic square-walk is the visible reversal that forecloses pure skepticism; tunnel rescue pays the price in risk and burned cables. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each recalled user session adds data, narrowing Mara’s options toward public exposure. Cost is legible—loss of anonymity, legal exposure—but the company’s countermove stays off-page, muting the final pinch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: shared cognition is less about mind-reading than about civic attention—paths between panic and care. The muscovite’s fractal forks evolve from curiosity to civic map, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image of “willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken” offers conceptual repricing: fragility becomes infrastructural. No thematic echo is spoken; insight stays in the lattice of light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lingers in Mara’s perceptual syntax—“fractures that looked fractally precise,” “human heat”—a photographer’s metrical eye. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative clauses build studio calm, then shorter beats under violet exposure. No head-hopping; Jory’s tingles arrive only as Mara reads them. One clause drifts toward omniscient—“the recall company tried to buy”—but snaps back to her offer of protocol, so POV violation is contained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “brewed tea, listened closely, and let their fear fill her darkroom” advances action, atmosphere, and stakes in one sweep. Figurative layer is dense yet patterned—ozone, clicking grid, willowglass—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “she asked him to move, to walk a simple square” could compress to “she had him walk a square,” but the repetition mirrors the protocol’s rigor, so artifact is minor. Closure line is uncluttered, letting final image resonate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-as-civic-infrastructure is fresh; recall-contaminated pills becoming urban-planning data is non-obvious synthesis. Muscovite lens turning body-tingles into fractal rescue routes transforms a geology prop into plot engine. Risk: premise flirts with sci-fi exposition, but grounding in somatic markers and light-printing keeps it specific. Final reconfiguration—“listen for paths”—feels inevitable yet not pre-fabricated.</comment>
