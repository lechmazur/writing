<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—rage at betrayal versus duty to real animals—play out in embodied micro-choices (chalk lists, phone call, crate signing). The final renunciation of vengeance is earned by the prior beat of hearing Tessa’s panic and seeing her own mirrored fragility. Cost is visible: public admission of naïveté, loss of sleep, legal exposure. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: each beat (discovery → chalk lists → call → sanctuary hand-off) tightens options because Mara’s self-respect forbids covering the fraud. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she files the report, keeps the animals, pins the tail—permanent social cost legible in the final image. No teleporting props; the shed tail’s return is set up and paid off. Orientation anchored by word 80; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The misty workshop micro-setting constrains every choice: heat-lamp glow dictates nocturnal labor, cedar smell anchors memory, fog at the door externalizes the blurred moral line. The chameleon terrarium functions as setting-in-miniature, its color shift timing the phone-call beat. Spatial choreography clean—crates, chalkboard, phone, tail towel all tracked. Weather (fog, stars) mirrors but never overwrites internal state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrity versus compassion—tightens when Mara realizes reporting will shame her yet save the animals. One meaningful turn: the phone call converts Tessa from abstract villain to mirror image, foreclosing pure retaliation. Price is on-page: public confession, sleepless night, permanent record. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; coincidence only complicates (van lease left the number).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the tail motif: regeneration possible only after shedding false certainty. No explicit thesis; the chalkboard lists and final pinning reweight “mercy” as active boundary-setting, not naïveté. Ambiguity remains—Tessa’s future still precarious, Mara’s reputation scarred. Emotional after-effect lingers in the quiet hiss of mist after the fog enters, resonating beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “heat lamps glowed like small moons” is her simile, not authorial flourish. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during crate lifting, mirroring fatigue. No head-hopping; Tessa’s voice arrives only through phone distortion. Distinctive diction—“quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness”—feels organic to Mara’s gentle yet precise handler mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long reflective sentences breathe, then staccato actions (“She wrote two lists…”) propel. No loops or synonym churn; “tail tip” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition. Figurative language sparse and accurate—tail as “curled fragment” is precise. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances character, image, or causality. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: wildlife-rescue scam as crucible for moral regeneration, not crime thriller. Tail-shedding metaphor is literal animal fact transformed into ethical lesson without forcing symbolism. Specificity of herpetological detail (humidity, feeder prep) anchors voice. Risk taken in quiet, restorative ending rather than courtroom drama; payoff lands via charged poise. Could edge higher if Tessa’s voice carried equal particularity.</comment>
