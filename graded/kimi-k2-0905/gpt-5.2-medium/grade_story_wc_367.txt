<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-herald persona is vivid and consistent; laughter as embodied weather-making gives a singular edge. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where the need to laugh collides with the cost of being right—so the final promise feels lightly earned. Still, the keeper’s micro-choices (tilting the wick, cutting paper ships) tether prophecy to bodily action, meeting the 9− threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green beam re-codes yesterday’s news into tomorrow’s warning, cost paid by the narrator’s raw throat and the mayor’s caution. Causal chain holds: joke → prophecy → flood → shadow-signal → empty streets. One soft spot: the mayor’s order happens off-stage, slightly diluting the because/therefore lens. Meets 9− gate with visible constraint left in the glass.</comment>

<comment>Emerald lens, salt-stung spiral stair, and ink-smelling cutouts create a tactile micro-setting that directly steers the final tactic. The lighthouse is both place and tool: its shutters and wick angles decide who lives. Sensory hierarchy skews to light-touch and smell, matching a keeper’s priorities. Environment constrains choice at climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the coast still be warned after print dies—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the narrator’s own joke turns lethal. Escalation is one smooth ramp: laughter births prophecy → prophecy births flood → flood forces shadow-play. Agency stays with the keeper; no coincidences resolve. Cost is the mayor’s warning and the narrator’s vow to “choose words,” foreclosing carefree laughter.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges: obsolete media can be re-illuminated into new signal if someone bears the cost of speaking light. Subtext lives in the green bleed of ink—yesterday’s stories literally tint the present. No moralizing; the final laugh is poised, not triumphant. Image of paper shadows crawling across water reweights earlier motif without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lyrical yet salt-practical: “I learned to steer that borrowed fire” marries physics and wonder. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under urgency; rhythm mirrors beam sweeps. No POV leakage; diction stays within keeper’s lexicon. Distinctive perceptual signature—light angles as grammar—holds to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable; figurative layering serves the concept, never obscuring causality. One scaffold loop: “laughing…laughter” echoes three times in mid-section without new pressure. Otherwise, sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, theme. Read-aloud rhythm surges with storm, then settles into starlit hush at exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing lighthouse optics with accidental oracle is fresh; using total internal reflection as both physics and metaphor raises the stake. Newspaper silhouettes re-cast nostalgia into lifesaving semaphore—specific, irreplaceable. Risky lyric escalation pays off in a final image that could not exist without every prior element. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
