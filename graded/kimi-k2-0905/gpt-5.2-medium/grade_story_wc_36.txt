<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s guilt-driven return and her trembling hand before un casing the flute embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the pilgrim’s quiet accusation crystallizes her flaw and the final shared breath on the reed shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry” avoids label-speak. One hairline slip: “she had feared the flute, and feared herself with it” edges toward self-diagnosis, but the next clause recovers with sensory consequence. Sufficient for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the driftwood arrows still wait, the hush is reweighted from menace to answer, and the cost—she must carry the pilgrim’s lesson forever—is legible in the final image. Causal lens holds: because she refused the pilgrim, she returns; because she plays while listening, not commanding, the boundary re-opens and reconfigures her stance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one taught shard transition into the frozen world. Persistent constraint—the flute’s danger—shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is not postcard backdrop: the stone throat of the split boulder literally opens only when the flute’s frequency is received, turning geology into gatekeeper. Driftwood markers, lacquered case, and iron-rain air taste are handled under goal-directed action, constraining her path and later charging the final image when the same arrows greet her return. Micro-setting qualifies: the reed’s delicate gold is the tactile environment that threatens to snap under breath. One hairline slip—“clouds frozen like ash” is visual shorthand only—but the range’s muteness alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she atone for the lost pilgrim—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when the corridor opens and she must choose between commanding or listening. One meaningful deepening: she shifts from seeking forgiveness to seeking understanding, foreclosing the old guardianship rule-set. Cost is visible: the pilgrim ages in the frozen world, proving time was stolen, and she exits carrying the hush as permanent burden. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—guardianship is wayfinding, not prohibition—emerges through the pilgrim’s spiral of outward-pointing wood and her inward-pointing correction; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of the waiting arrows reweights the opening failure into quiet responsibility, a Conceptual Repricing that costs her certainty. Subtext in the shared hand on the flute says collaboration replaces control. Complexity preserved: rules were not wrong, but her deafness to need was.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited voice carries a hush-inflected syntax—long breathy clauses that mimic flute phrases, then short plosive beats (“She stepped through”). Perceptual signature is acoustic: sound sinks, thunder is held like a held breath; no other character would notice this way. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s dialogue is spare, flint-eyed, distinct from her denser interior. Compression taught early—“sound did not travel so much as sink”—pays off in the frozen world’s ash-cloud silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary from 5 to 35 words, accelerating into the corridor, then settling into quiet cadence at exit. Figurative layer is disciplined: every metaphor (stone throat, iron rain) maps to physical logic of the world. One near-loop: “avalanchingly quiet and heavy” is echoed later as “avalanchingly quiet hush”; because the echo is purposeful reprise that recharges the ending, it reads as pattern, not scaffold. Zero grammar or pronoun errors; strong verbs carry motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy trope of music-opening-portal is retooled into acoustic archaeology: the player must listen, not command, turning cliché into moral instrument. Driftwood geometry as apology-in-wood is fresh world logic; pilgrim’s mirrored failure shows the idea has internal rules. Risk taken: no villain, only flawed protocol, yet stakes feel mythic. Specificity of “lacquered case strapped like a child” makes relic-keeping lived rather than ornamental.</comment>
