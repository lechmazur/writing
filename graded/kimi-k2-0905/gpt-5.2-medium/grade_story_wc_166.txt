<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s dancer-trained attention to rhythm and gap anchors every micro-choice; the anchored-bench ordeal externalizes her refusal to surrender memory, body, and art. Interiority stays concrete—“warmth crawled,” “ink turned silver and cold”—never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation (fledge onward, not back) is earned by the night-long ordeal and costs her the safety of stillness. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden slackens its grip only after the poem is cut into her skin, making exile irreversible and portable. Causal chain—speck → anchoring → seated dance → inscription → release—holds without ellipsis or convenience. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the final image of the linen-wrapped arm and the garden “keeping time behind her,” a persistent constraint she now carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The twilight garden’s blackleaf spirals and brine-whispering fountains are not backdrop; they dictate how the poem must be written (seated, tide-timed, silver ink). The bench-as-mooring functions as micro-setting that literally pins the protagonist, forcing tactical innovation. Sensory selection mirrors dancer perception: currents, spray, star-gaps. Final constraint—the cooled silver ink under linen—carries the garden’s physical law with her, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the poem survive censorship?—is signaled in the opening paragraph and sharpened by the garden’s bargain: keep the speck and stay anchored, or surrender and forget. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each prick of the needle narrows her future options until the tattooed arm makes return impossible. The cost is visible blood-ink and the permanent exile she chooses. Under causal lens, every beat is because/therefore; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—art as embodied memory that tyrants cannot erase—emerges through the act of tattooing star-measures on skin rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: the seated dance is both submission to the garden’s law and defiance of the city’s. The heron fledging parallels her own without a single explanatory line. Final image of bodies inscribed with “star-measures” reweights nostalgia from contraband mineral to collective light—resonant, unsentimental, morally complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight inside Mira’s dancer sensorium—currents, gaps, tide tables—without head-hopping. Prose rhythm mimics surf: long clauses that break at commas, then short crests (“She wrapped her tattooed arm in linen”). Diction remains within her lexicon: no academic or corporate register slips. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“she became spontaneously anchored”) they mark the unnatural force, not padding. Voice is distinct, consistent, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, world-rule—without scaffold: “The warmth crawled up her arm and, without warning, she became spontaneously anchored…” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (tide, star-chart, ink as cooled starlight) and physically grounded. Rhythm accelerates under needle, breathes during star-gazing, mirroring pulse. One mixed image only—“glittered like a trapped tide”—but clarity intact. Closure line is clean, propulsive, echo-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines memory-police dystopia, dancer kinesiology, and cosmic tattooing in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet unseen. The moonstone speck as condensed nostalgia is a conceptual risk that pays off narratively and thematically. Anchored choreography turns constraint into compositional method—risk that heightens rather than obscures stakes. Final network of inscribed bodies offers a non-literal, luminous answer to censorship—fresh, specific, irreplicable with names or places swapped.</comment>
