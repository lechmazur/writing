<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gardener’s “blithe” label is asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Interiority drifts into generic lament (“joy is easier to carry”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. The final planting of the ash reads as symbolic duty, not a choice that costs him anything personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sovereign case → tapestry cipher → salt ledger → widowed relief. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gardener re-weights the silo from crime scene to shrine, cost felt in the shifted night “less like a shroud.” One soft spot: the cipher’s chess-move code is revealed in summary, not tested on the page, slightly deflating the pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through the gardener’s professional eye—tools “laid out tenderly,” dirt under nails—so every object doubles as character texture. The silo’s “velveteen gloom” and star-cut roof constrain sound and sight, guiding the lantern-led search and the final planting. Micro-setting (folded sackcloth, broken clock flag) anchors each beat without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes hinge on whether Tomas’s silence was betrayal or sacrifice; the tapestry decode supplies the single tightening that reframes the widow’s grief. Escalation is linear—one revelation—yet sufficient for 700 words. Cost is borne by Alvera (tears, revised memory) rather than the protagonist, keeping pressure external.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “listening to the dead” emerges through tactile decoding rather than thesis: threads, salt ledger, ash sapling form a quiet argument that memorials are unfinished conversations. Final image re-weights “quiet” from eerie to consolatory without moralizing. Avoids sentimental uplift by leaving Tomas’s fate opaque.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a gardener’s patience—counting stitches like graves—syntax slow, cadence horticultural. Figurative layer (“statue rubbed warm”) stays within narrator’s sensory reach. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; interior monologue remains consistent, modulating from wary to solemn without sermon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo”) risks purple but remains anchored to POV’s heightened night perception. One mixed metaphor drift: “night feels less like a shroud and more like velvet” edges close to tactile cliché, yet the reweighting justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusion of wartime refugee cipher, chess-clock dead-drop, and cemetery lore feels idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight. The tapestry-as-map device refreshes the over-used “hidden ledger” trope by threading it through gardener’s professional gaze. Risky compression succeeds: 700 words deliver complete arc without explanatory bloat.</comment>
