<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. rescue compulsion—surfaces in the diary key moment, but Orren’s childhood offer is summary, not embodied choice. The final renegotiation shows earned cost: she trades correction for lives, foreclosing the curator’s hoarding. Yet the “carefully resourceful” trait is asserted more than tested; twine and lamp vanish after first mention, muting micro-struggle. Still, her grammar-as-spell agency feels individual, not archetype, and the silence-equals-omission flaw drives the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Lysa hears silence → she maps omissions → she inserts blank pages → corridor opens → readers breathe. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80 (“mountain shook… new door in the snow”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the store’s rule-set is rewritten so rescue missions arrive *before* loss becomes law; the cost is the curator’s remembered humanity and Lysa’s forfeited monopoly on correction. One minor causality fuzz: the diary’s “missing note” hum is not shown to us, only reported, but it does not break the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The staircase-steps-as-alphabet and receipt-clerk made of stitched paper constrain literal movement and payment, integrating setting into tactics. The living fern that matches the pressed specimen is a micro-setting hinge: touching it collapses the corridor, proving environment alters choice. Spatial choreography stays clean—twine marks, vault of blank spines—without white-room drift. The unheard symphony is atmosphere that finally resolves, recharging the opening image at exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rescue before loss becomes law”—tightens when Lysa realizes silence *is* the wall; inserting blank pages is the single decisive escalation that forecloses failure. Cost is legible: the curator’s dust-cloak thins, implying vulnerability, and Lysa relinquishes sole authorship of correction. No reversal overload; one meaningful turn suffices for 700-word span. Pressure stays causal under the rescue clock, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge kept unfinished *is* violence; completing the blank rewrites history. Subtext lives in gesture—naming a fern unlocks bodies—avoiding thematic statement until the final chord. The diary’s skipped pages reappear as key, reweighting omission from flaw to tool. No moralizing coda; the dawn light on readers finishing stories elsewhere is resonance enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lysa’s perceptual bias: grammar as spell, silence as score. Syntax flexes—“shelves breathing in chords of paper and ink”—without purple overload. No head-hopping; Orren’s warnings filter through her attention. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Lysa’s contractual syntax vs. the curator’s dust-voice. Rhythm accelerates during corridor collapse, then exhales at dawn, matching emotional cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the act of naming loosened a spell that had pinched the corridor shut” advances plot, image, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the musical-bookstore logic. Minor filter verb (“she realized”) appears once at climax but does not stall momentum. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic imagery, creating purposeful envelope.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore that keeps *unfinished* books as hiding places for historical error is a fresh synthesis of library-heist and time-rescue tropes. Using blank pages as literal key turns absence into agency, a non-obvious mechanic that feels inevitable after setup. Risk: dense conceptual compression could alienate, but payoff lands cleanly. The unheard symphony as both tone and plot device elevates premise beyond gimmick.</comment>
