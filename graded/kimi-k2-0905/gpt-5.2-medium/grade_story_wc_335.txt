<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory impulses—mentoring while retreating—are dramatized in the backwards-walk tic; Mara’s shift from defiant thief to naming herself is embodied in the trembling pen stroke. The cost of reopening the city’s memory is felt when the exile tag falls, proving resilience can be mentored yet still paid for by the child alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-tea-glass alignment flips the tribunal’s balcony into a door that only opens when Mara’s lines stop shaking—an earned image that reweights exile from sentence to choice. Causal lens holds: every beat (shadow trapped, leaf geometry, tag falling) is a because/therefore linkage anchored to the shard-archive rules taught on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library-as-lung, cracked teacup, and swing-time hush form a micro-setting that constrains the ritual: dust smell limits how fast Mara can breathe, the creaking swing marks the minutes the door stays open. These objects are handled, not catalogued, so the final mirror press is spatially grounded and irreversible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the city let her back in?”—tightens when the shadow-door’s hinge demands unshaking annotation; failure means permanent exile. One meaningful escalation: her first steady pen stroke narrows options from defiance to self-authorship, price visible in the brass tag dropping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not mercy but geometry you practice until the angle cuts you free. The reprise of the swing’s hush reframes silence from abandonment to witness, charging the final image with the cost of keeping the city’s past alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lio’s perceptual signature—walking backwards, cataloguing angles no witness admits—creates a compressed, ritual cadence that modulates into combative tenderness under Mara’s glare. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays anchored to his lexicon of shards, ledgers, and hinges.</comment>

<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “the forgotten library listens like a lung holding breath” fuses metaphor, stakes, and setting in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into the mirror press, then exhales with the tag’s fall, mirroring the swing’s cadence outside.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as a bureaucratic spell that can be unwritten by re-annotating your own shadow is a fresh synthesis of memory-work and penal policy; the shard-mirror archive makes the concept tactile. Risk—mentoring inside the very institution that erases children—pays off in the final image of Mara holding the pen that once condemned her.</comment>
