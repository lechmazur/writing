<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt-driven return and the foam-to-insight beat feel earned; her interior contradiction (“leave a form behind and still fly” vs “abandonment”) is dramatized through the chrysalis handling and patent release. The micro-choice to volunteer the patent rights carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the brother relationship is off-stage, so the emotional stakes lean on summary rather than live relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new bridge stands, patent is open-licensed, and the chrysalis burial makes the cost undeniable. Causal chain (foam insight → reformulation → public admission → safer bridge) holds without gaps. Lens is Causal throughout; no orientation debt. One hairline slip: the corporation’s capitulation is compressed into a single sentence, slightly thinning the final constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The braided ravine is not backdrop; its shear lines literally generate the scientific insight that re-configures the adhesive and the ethical stance. Foam patterns, warm rock, scalloped rafts—each tactile detail is filtered through polymer-chemist perception and steers the climactic choice. Environment constrains the final image: the last plank settles above the same foam that taught her. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens when the open-license decision forecloses corporate secrecy and personal anonymity. The foam-insight beat is the single meaningful escalation that narrows options: she must either hide or share the force-dissipating chemistry. Cost is legible: loss of patent income and public exposure. No reversal overload; one decisive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the foam-to-polymer translation: fractures can be braided, not erased. The chrysalis reprise beneath the cairn reweights “leaving a form” from betrayal to continuity without moralizing. Final image—“the rhythm felt like a duet, not a dirge”—offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo penalty; no final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s synesthetic chemist ear—“naming catalysts like instruments”—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in ravine, staccato lab list at station, matching emotional cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. One clause drifts toward authorial certainty (“she understood that leaving and joining were the same motion”), but it is anchored in immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “foam gathered in scalloped rafts” shows image and foreshadows shear domains. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. High-pressure beat (insight on rock) keeps figurative language sparse and precise. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hike uphill and the hammer-blow finale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: using fluid shear patterns to inspire a toughened adhesive is both scientifically plausible and emotionally coherent with grief-braiding. The open-license atonement reframes corporate-liability tropes without moral caricature. Risk taken—lyric science metaphor—pays off in closure. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, because the foam-insight is site-specific and profession-specific.</comment>
