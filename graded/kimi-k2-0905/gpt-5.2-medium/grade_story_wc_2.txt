<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—trading certainty for doubt—drives every beat; the midnight-chime obsession and gear-in-pocket habit embody it. Her bargain with Corin crystallizes the flaw into a costly choice: surrender the compass rose to build a probabilistic clock, renouncing the admiral’s rage-driven certainty. The stance shift is earned, visible, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: harbor fire → admiral’s need → feather lure → tunnel descent → compass recovery → bargain. The midnight-minute motif and ash-gray feather pattern teach the lens early; closure reweights it when the chiming minute becomes chosen, not fixed. Cost is legible in the final line: “the town could begin again without pretending it knew the route.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass-roof conservatory breathing smoke, gear-teeth footholds on slick rock, and the brass star’s warmth anchor every move. The subterranean waterfall’s reflection-less pool constrains access and charges the final image. Each object—feather, cracked clock faces, compass hub—returns with altered weight, integrating setting into stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: replace certainty with navigable doubt. Pressure tightens when Mara must decide: return the compass rose or repurpose it into a clock of probabilities. The choice forecloses the admiral’s rage-path and costs Mara her own habitual reliance on fixed midnight. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—embracing uncertainty as civic survival—emerges through burnt maps, bent compass points, and a clock that measures chance. No character states the thesis; the final image of a town “without pretending it knew the route” reweights all prior imagery. Ambiguity lingers, charged and costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s skeptical, gear-counting mind. Syntax mirrors her tactile precision: “she set a handful of broken gears in her pocket.” No head-hop; Corin’s dialogue is spare, distinct, and goal-driven. Voice modulates under spray-roar pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “roots hung like dark hair.” Information density high—each clause advances image or stakes. No artifacts obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing clock-repair, naval navigation, and post-fire botanic ruins into a probabilistic compass-clock feels inevitable yet fresh. The ash-gray feather as breadcrumb, the midnight-minute as lure, and the waterfall as map-table transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking—subterranean hydro-engineer, time-as-doubt—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
