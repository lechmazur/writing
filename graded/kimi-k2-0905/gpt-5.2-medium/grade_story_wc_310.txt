<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s quiet enthusiasm and coin-casting are vividly particular; the contradiction between her calm and the apocalypse outside is embodied in the click of coins and the micro-choice to split the dish. Interiority stays concrete—she “laughs once, small in her helmet”—never sliding into label-speak. The final looped sacrifice is earned: she burns the last fuel to become the signal she was told to send, so the cost is on-page and scaled to the length. Only the engineers remain generic voices, but they function as pressure, not people, so the crucible holds.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain is clean: prophecy → coin pattern → split dish → fuel burn → signal loop. Orientation is immediate—who/where/when locked in the first 60 words—and the experimental backwards-prophecy rule is taught early and paid off in the final tremor. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the edgewise coin lands blank, proving the prophecy was never certainty but the permission to act anyway; the cost is the station’s last energy, felt in the deck tremble. No teleporting props or retro-patching; every beat obeys the taught temporal inversion.</comment>

<comment>The ambered deck, bruised sky, and coins as “stubborn little planets” are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. Environment constrains the climax: the dome’s amber panels glow only when the final capacitor burn occurs, marrying setting to choice. Spatial choreography is tight—coins spin on the console, dish bearings strain, bodies feel the tremor—no floating rooms. One micro-gap: we never learn how the split dish physically fits the station, but the image’s charge overrides the quibble at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can purpose survive a contracting universe?—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the prophecy forces a binary (core/rim) then removes it via the edgewise coin. Agency sits with Mara at every turn: she casts, reads, distills, and chooses the split that costs the last fuel. The price is legible on-page—fuel gone, station trembling, blank coin—and forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal under the time-loop lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “purpose is not a monument but a loop,” crystallized when Mara realizes the signal she sends is the reason she exists to send it. No character states the thesis aloud; the insight is earned through the fuel burn and the blank coin. The backwards prophecy reweights every prior beat: hope becomes doubt, doubt becomes permission. Final image—amber glow remembered rather than received—offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual signature: coins click like planets, static arrives “as if the void is stuttering.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“she locks the transmitter… a sacrament made of chemistry and fear”—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; engineers’ dialogue is sparse, utilitarian, distinct from the lyric interior. Elision of technical jargon is purposeful and taught early, so the final chord lands legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are few, sharp, and coherent—“bruise lit from within,” “broken chord”—never stacked to clutter. Information density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, world-rule, and emotional tilt. A single paraphrase hiccup—“the prophecy was never about certainty, but about becoming aligned enough to act anyway”—could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The backwards-prophecy loop, coin-cast decision ritual, and contracting-universe frame synthesize into a singular stance rather than a gimmick. Risk is high—time-loop stories invite cliché—yet the piece escapes via tactile specificity (museum coins, capacitor tremor) and the blank final coin that refuses triumph. Removing any core element collapses the loop, proving irreplaceability. The concept commits fully, no safety middle.</comment>
