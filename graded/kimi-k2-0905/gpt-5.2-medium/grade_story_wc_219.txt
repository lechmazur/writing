<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” identity is embodied through self-experimentation and refusal to kneel; the final theft of Pilgrim Salt crystallizes her academic rebellion with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak, and the contradiction between institutional duty and private curiosity plays out in the moment she cuts the shard. The only bar to 9.0 is that the pilgrims remain anonymous; no second character applies pressure, so the crucible is purely internal. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s theft reweights the entire pilgrimage from managed ritual to personal catalyst, with the warm fly amber and shard in pocket as felt constraint. Causality holds: every beat accumulates sensory data that feeds the final crystallization; no information appears without prior seed. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“rainwashed tower… I arrived”). The lens stays Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies until the seam opens—and the final image of “different chemistry” is legible cost. A hairline slip: the council’s motive is asserted, not dramatized, keeping the score just sub-9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The tower, sculpture path, and bronze door constrain every movement; microcrystals literally grow under humidity, forcing the narrator’s scalpel decision. Fly amber functions as micro-setting whose volatile terpenes catalyze the door—irreplaceable object-as-setting. Rain and ivy are not backdrop but reactants, feeding Pilgrim Salt. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: biochemist notices resin volatiles, not tourist gargoyles. Final image of pocketed shard charges the earlier “cooled bronze” with stolen warmth—environment reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control over the meaning of homecoming—tightens when the signal translates into footprint crystals, foreclosing the council’s scripted narrative. Narrator’s agency drives escalation: pocketing the unfiltered receiver, scraping crystals, cracking the vial, cutting the shard—each act narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits institutional protection and carries contraband that will chemically betray her. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the deepening is sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff 775 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “home is a volatile compound, not a memory”—never stated, only enacted through terpene reactions and stolen crystal. The final reconfiguration reframes nostalgia as intellectual property the narrator now smuggles, not feels. Subtext in the archivist’s silent gift and the pilgrims’ synchronized halt implies institutional complicity without exposition. No moralizing line intrudes; the shard’s glint is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a scientist’s perceptual signature: tracer dyes, reaction clocks, terpene readouts—never generic lyricism. Syntax tightens under pressure—“I cracked the vial”—then widens for reflective calibration. No head-hopping; unreliability is limited to what chemistry can measure, keeping distance modest and consistent. The final quiet after “bronze quiet” is cadence control, not monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short scalpel cuts to longer accumulative clauses that mirror crystal growth; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor chemically grounded—“stones like cooled bronze” sets temperature and alloy for later door. No paraphrase loops; “microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders” is first and only comparison. One near-slip: “pattern pulsed with the regularity of a reaction clock” borders on textbook simile, but POV licenses it. Closure line is clean, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of biochemistry and pilgrimage ritual is non-obvious; the tower is not alien but a tuning chamber for human volatiles—fresh inversion of first-contact trope. Risk is taken by making the MacGuffin a scent-activated salt that grows on humidity, yet science stays accurate. Without the fly-amber catalyst the door never opens; without the shard theft the theme collapses—irreplaceable parts. The final image of “different chemistry” re-prices the entire premise, feeling inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
