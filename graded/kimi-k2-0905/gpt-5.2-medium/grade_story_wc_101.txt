<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amira’s gently-persistent bell-ringing and anonymous-fund tactics are shown through embodied micro-choices (hiding routes, counting coins by touch), but the interior contradiction between fear and hope stays summary-level; no moment lets us feel both impulses collide inside her body. The final daylight ring is earned, yet the cost is collective, not personally internalized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: each bell-ring tightens risk → route change → daylight defiance. Closure is a Charged Poise: the arbor bell at noon reconfigures the stakes—public defiance now possible—while the felt cost (future midnight raids) is legible in the officer’s earlier warning. One clean transition (midnight→dawn) keeps the two-shard default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta arbor’s clay smell and wind-pocket constrain hiding tactics and return in the final daylight ring, charging the image. Ridge/port geography stays coherent; chalk-star doorways and decoy alleys are tactile lived-in detail. Weather is skipped but not missed; micro-setting (bell, satchel, tin box) does the constraining work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep people fed without exposing donors—tightens when the officer threatens midnight inspection; Amira’s decoy-route decision visibly raises collective risk. Pressure is causal, single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is the now-public bell-ring that forecloses secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: anonymity as communal solidarity rather than absence. The final daylight bell reweights earlier hiding, offering a non-literal answer—gratitude can go public while givers stay hidden—without moralizing. No echoing of “thesis” lines keeps subtext intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Amira; perceptual signature is tactile (coins counted “by touch,” clay smell). Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during the raid; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic (“Whoever Helped”) and carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“soft as a spoon on glass”). Information density high: one line often does scene-work and metaphor simultaneously. Clean grammar; pronouns track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: humanitarian smuggling reframed through an antique bell that anonymizes gratitude. The midnight-lettered arbor wall feels specific to this exile ridge; removing the bell or the chalk-star system would collapse the plot. Risk—public daylight ring—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
