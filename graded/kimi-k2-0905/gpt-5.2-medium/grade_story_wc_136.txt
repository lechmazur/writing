<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s compulsive cartography and the flask-shaped admission are embodied in micro-choices (kneeling to the seam, pocket placement of the punch). Interior contradiction—precision vs. self-deception—drives every beat; the final renunciation costs her the safety of silence and is causally seeded by the phantom punch’s earlier clicks. No head-count or relationship pressure on page, so bullets 6–8 N/A. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses act in scene and the final stance is earned with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the punched card and star-dust first step crystallize a before/after in the fortress of unspoken truths with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—cracks → seam → phantom punch → admission → train—tightens once yet forecloses return. Orientation anchored by word 90 (“riverfront mist”). Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. 9+ quick test satisfied: cost is legible in the crescent hole and the door of stacked letters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Starlit vault, mist lanes, and tile-counting embed the body in tactile navigation; the phantom punch serves as micro-setting that constrains the honesty test. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual angles, smell of ink—mirrors Mara’s cartographic gaze without tourist excess. Environment actively guides the choice to kneel and descend; the final platform of silent stone is charged by prior arrow imagery. Meets 9+ gate: the punch-as-tool shapes the final tactic and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—voice the unspoken or remain erased—signals early via the flask-shaped silence. One meaningful tightening: the admission narrows options to “no returns.” Pressure escalates causally under Causal lens; each crack, seam, and punch click raises the cost of continued silence. Price is visible in the punched card and the irrevocable door of letters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the geometry of silence: maps can chart what we refuse to say. Subtext operates in the punch’s silent click and the blank card; no thematic statement is spoon-fed. Final image of unspoken letters waiting to be spoken reweights earlier cartographic motifs without moralizing. Complexity preserved: honesty is necessary yet terrifying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly filtered through Mara’s cartographic perceptual signature—angles, calipers, star-dust. Syntax lengthens during discovery, compresses at the admission: “I kept drinking because silence felt safer than change.” No dialogue to evaluate; interior diction stays within her professional lexicon. Patterned elision (phantom punch without metal body) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering (“constellations pinned like route markers”) is sparse and purposeful, never muddling causality. High information density: one sentence often maps motion, sensory data, and emotional charge. Zero artifacts in final third; prose propels toward the punched crescent and star-dust step.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses urban-explorer folklore with personal sobriety quest; the erased Midnight Line feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if Mara isn’t a route mapper—her tools literally punch the ticket to truth. Risky lyric compression (mist lanes, star-colored lamp) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of cartographic cracks as divining arrows is non-portable novelty.</comment>
