<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s cryptic patience is shown through embodied ritual, but he never faces a contradictory impulse or visible cost; Elske’s grief is sketched but not tested in a way that alters the tuner’s path. Interiority is atmospheric rather than crucible-level, so the final exit feels predetermined, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s sonic resurrection lands with conceptual cost—the tuner’s departure leaves the townspeople to sustain the fragile rhythm themselves. Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens: nightly footfall pattern → subsidence reversal, signaled early by the archway echo. Orientation anchored by Roman stones within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archway and cobblestone instrument are vivid, selective, and constrain the tuner’s method; density of Roman stone, keystone tremor, and spiral pitches are filtered through auditory bias. Micro-setting succeeds, but broader town geography remains schematic; still, the cobblestone pattern is inseparable from the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subsidence-as-stake is signaled early and tightens through each dusk walk; reversal is legible under Accumulative lens. However, the town’s agency is passive—Elske observes, never risking a choice that could fail—so price is conceptual, not personal. One meaningful cadence shift satisfies length, but lacks a visible trade-off on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-survival emerges through sonic imagery without sermon; final “tentative song” reweights earlier silence. Ambiguity survives—tuner’s motives remain opaque—allowing counter-readings. Avoids thesis statement; resonance is felt in sternum vibration image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature is auditory—echo, resonance, sub-aural tones—creating distinct texture. Compression (“fermented echoes”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; syntax modulates with climb-descent rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty—sound and stakes—without scaffold; “density as compressed silence” is precise. Occasional poetic uplift (“gaps between stars”) stays within tuner’s mythic register. Zero loops, clear propulsion to final bell strike.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Takes the hackneyed “mysterious stranger saves town” and recodes salvation as acoustic engineering; footfall-as-tuning is fresh. Risk taken with low-explainer mythic mode pays off. Could not swap tuner for any other archetype without breaking sonic logic.</comment>
