<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically sustained, her affliction/gift shown through sensory embodiment (“colors returned so violently she gasped”). The causal line from muteness to surrender is clear, but the moment of rupture—“the word for creation itself”—leans abstract, slightly muting felt cost. A single micro-choice (kneel, press palms) carries the beat; more bodily friction would sharpen stakes. Still, the arc from paralysis to receptive “rest” is character-specific and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor site deposits a micro-revelation that layers density until the archway catalyzes release. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance flips from striving to surrender, cost legible in the final image of auroras painting her lids. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. The grandmother instruction is the only causal leap off-page, but the astrolabe calibrates memory on-stage, keeping causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through synesthetic POV—“auroras draped like funeral silks,” stone “older than any recorded calendar”—details are selective, never catalogic. The archway functions as micro-setting that literally channels cosmic dust into Elara’s body, constraining the final release. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, press palms, lie back. Weather (aurora) affects physiology (colors flood veins), charging closure. One proper-noun economy lapse: “northern ridge” never re-anchors, but the ridge is not reused, so clarity holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creative suffocation—is signaled early and deepened through each meteor stop. The final tightening occurs when the astrolabe points downward, forcing surrender rather than pursuit; cost is the vertigo ofColors returning “violently.” Escalation is accumulative: humming fingertips → fragment of dream → full auroral flood. No off-stage rescue; coincidence merely decorates. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the external antagonist (glass cage) is metaphoric, slightly softening visceral risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—creation through surrender—emerges via the inversion of agency: stop searching, allow stardust to re-enter. The motif of “unwritten calendar” reweights at closure, becoming a limitless future. No moralizing; the final whispered exchange is image, not thesis. Subtextual tension between hearing others’ silences and reclaiming her own speech enriches the central question without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“moonstruck,” “rete whispered”) stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with physiological intensity—long sentences for twilight blur, fragments at climax (“Rest.”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful (“she heard it”). The speculative register is sustained without committee voice; the only elevated phrase—“cosmic dust had come to rest”—is justified by the transcendent moment.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned (falling stars / whispered names) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; “funeral silks” is apt for auroral drapery. One scaffold near-opening: “Not metaphor. Literal instruction.”—the second sentence could collapse into the first. Otherwise, sentences propel: information rides sensory image. Copy-clean apart from one missing space after em-dash, not enough to obscure closure.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses meteoric residue with creative block—a fresh angle on the “artist unblocked” trope. The astrolabe forged from “copper and bone” is specific, not token steampunk. Surrender as the active method subverts the usual striving arc. Some phrasing edges toward familiar lyricism (“infinite,” “ancient pull”), but the synthesis of auroral physics and mystic craft feels particular to this narrator. Risk is moderate; payoff clean.</comment>
