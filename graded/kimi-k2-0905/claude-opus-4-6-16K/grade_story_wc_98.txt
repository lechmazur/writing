<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—empirical skepticism vs. wonder—is dramatized in the seed-mending beat; the tears and pulsing palms embody cost. Micro-choice to lie beside the leaking seed is specific and irreversible. Final stance of holding “doubt and her wonder in equal measure” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible residue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: forgetting → traced to seed → dream transfer → closure. Orientation anchored by word 80; monsoon clock keeps tightening. Closure is Charged Poise: seed whole, village story restored, but Maren’s empirical journal still records “I could not explain it”—conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fireflower light and amber sap are selective, sensory, and tied to memory drain; ridge flowers dim in exact cadence with amnesia, integrating setting into causality. Micro-setting—the cracked seed beneath her palms—literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains stable across ridge, village, and dream.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loss of collective memory—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates with each vanished craft. Tightening beat: four-day monsoon clock makes inaction costly. Agency is renunciation of pure empiricism; price is unexplained miracle entered into permanent record. Escalation is linear, no reversals, sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the necessary coexistence of myth and empirical truth; final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in “luminous doubt” pulses through every observation; journal sketch of inexplicable fracture lines carries irony. No thematic echo sentences; complexity held in silence on ridge at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual filter—viscosity measurements, sketches, skepticism—without leakage. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for wonder, abrupt fragments under dream saturation. No dialogue, so voice carries entire texture; “reality checker” idiom remains consistent and un-showy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pressure; density high—“petals casting golden light upward into the pre-monsoon haze” does three jobs. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (sap = memory). Final sentence varies cadence, lands on charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy amnesia trope is refreshed via empirical protagonist who records her own failure to explain the fix. Dream-transfer repair is seeded by ancestral journal, avoiding deus ex machina. Specific island rules—tides obey emotions, non-spectral colors—give irreplaceable texture. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent closure; pays off.</comment>
