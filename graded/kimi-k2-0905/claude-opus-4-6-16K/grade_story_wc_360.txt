<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—the borrowed personalities give concrete, character-specific texture—but the final “understanding” arrives as an asserted epiphany (“She understood then”) rather than a choice that costs her anything on the page. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in the closing beat; she simply keeps composing. The halo fragment re-weights perception but never forces a micro-decision that forecloses an option, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cold fragment against her sternum crystallizes the sky’s grief-equation and reconfigures her stance toward the remaining stars; the cost is the undeniable ache of shared erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each star-loss thickens the pattern—but the causal linkage between “star vanishes → equation shifts → Maren must act” is asserted rather than shown tightening her options. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<comment>The topaz floor that lenses starlight into prismatic equations is not backdrop; it actively supplies the data she is losing and charges the final image when the fragment goes cold. Spatial choreography is clean—press bed, composing stone, drying line—each object handled in motion. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (widow’s grief “sat behind her eyes like a second pair of hands”). The workshop’s absence of a roof is never exploited as a tactical constraint, only as cosmic viewport, keeping the setting just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—decode the mathematics of emotion before the dataset disappears—is signaled early and tightens as each subtraction rewrites the wall equations. The halo fragment offers a new sensor but does not force a trade-off or visible price; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the sky is “solving for grief,” but the beat is delivered as interior summary rather than a decision that narrows her options. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens yet never forces a renunciation or resource loss that alters next moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as a calculable waveform—emerges through the shifting star-equations and the fragment’s transposed ache, never stated as thesis. The final image of “counting the spaces between” reweights prior material by turning absence itself into data. Ambiguity is architected, not decorative; the broadsheet’s unreadability enacts the theme that empathy survives only in uncertainty. A trace of pseudo-profundity in “the precise, turbulent, unbearable clarity…” is the only overt nudge, but it is anchored to embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a distinct lyric-ruminative texture—compressed metaphors, patterned parallelism (“not numbers. Not symbols.”)—that remains legible and teaches its cadence early. Perceptual signature is sharp: Maren notices “borrowed lens of someone else’s attention” and “frequency just below hearing,” details only this POV would register. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to her sensorium. Minor register drift—“transposed empathy,” “conceptual repricing” diction—surfaces once but is absorbed by the technical frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully—long accumulative clauses build density, then snap to fragments under pressure. Figurative language is dense but patterned, not ornamental; mixed metaphors are avoided. One scaffold slip: “she experienced something she’d never managed…” tells what the next sentence shows. Information density is high; every paragraph advances either the star-loss tally or the fragment’s effect. No loops or synonym churn in the final third, allowing the cold-fragment image to land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of celestial erasure + emotional cryptography + letterpress ambiguity feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight; no recent analogue comes to mind. The risk of a roofless workshop and disappearing stars could tilt into whimsy, but the piece commits to its internal logic and follows the waveform premise to the last line. Specificity anchors the concept: the widow’s grief as “second pair of hands,” the halo fragment’s sub-audible hum. Transformation test passed—this plot collapses if the topaz floor or fragment is swapped for generic equivalents.</comment>
