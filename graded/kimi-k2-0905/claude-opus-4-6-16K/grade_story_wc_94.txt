<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction is vivid: the censored poet who redacted herself. The embodied emotion—“raw syllable of a sob”—lands without label-speak. The final micro-choice to write on the timetable is earned by the photograph’s causal shock. Minor loss of edge: “genuinely flawed” is asserted rather than shown in mid-scene action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean CR: the photograph reweights the entire premise—her complicity in erasure—at the tolling of the timer. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift at “four minutes and eleven seconds into the rest of her life” reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. No orientation drift; storm, altitude, and object states track. Cost is legible in the single line where she presses the photo to her chest and writes—no further exposition needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Observatory-as-micro-setting constrains every move: frost under boots, violet storm-light through the slit, the timer’s frozen hand. The copper dome’s patina mirrors her own stained erosion. Bodies and objects stay spatially coherent; telescope, cot, charts anchor the single room. Storm and altitude are not backdrop but tactical pressure—thinned air makes pretense impossible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she breathe her own grief without redaction—tightens once: the timer’s bell forces the envelope choice. Escalation is textural: each ticking second rarefies the air and her options. Photograph reveal is the visible price; it forecloses continued self-censorship. Agency is crystallized attention—she does not flee the dome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: maps of scars, self-redacted pages, father’s damaged landscapes. Final image—“atlas of what she had survived”—reweights prior motifs without sermon. Subtext in the timer’s frozen four-eleven: time can be arrested but truth cannot. No thematic echo; the sob is the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is relentless lyric compression: “wound in the sky,” “second ocean,” “cartography of scars.” Rhythm accelerates with ticking syntax, then opens into the final long breath. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent. Voice sustains under peak pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job: “storm-light that poured through the observation slit in sheets of violet and silver” does setting, atmosphere, and metaphoric charge simultaneously. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers Charged Poise. No mixed metaphors; “raw syllable of a sob” is precise. Read-aloud ear test passes—cadence modulates with emotional crest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: self-censorship as altitude sickness, timer as metronome for both photograph development and poetic rebirth. Observatory above cloudline becomes literal rarefaction chamber for truth. Risk in lyric density pays off—closure remains legible. Not derivative; father’s toaster-to-film mistake is singular detail.</comment>
