<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—meticulous pattern-making vs. surrender to tide—play out in embodied micro-choices (bead placement, ankle immersion). The altitude gauge as inherited talisman links grandmother/mother grief to present action, giving visible cost when she accepts water’s revision of her design. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; “soil warms before anything green” shows pre-joy physically. Final ascent carries credible renunciation: she leaves the decorations to dissolve, carrying only the gauge and wordless equation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (beads, wire, sea-glass primes) increases until tide’s edit reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—needle points upward, equation unwritten in body—cost is the half-ruined pattern she abandons. Orientation anchored by word 90 (“tide-polished grotto”). No causality breaks; water’s revision is external force that complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto walls, brass gauge, and tide are not backdrop but active editors: tide erases/reorders beads, gauge’s swing redirects attention twice. Sensory triangulation (mineral sheen, warm water, brass heartbeat) filters through Maren’s engineer-dreamer bias. Spatial choreography clean: beads tracked as they drift; her body moves from cross-legged to standing, water level logged inch by inch. Final image—clouds like someone else’s trial balloons—reuses sky metaphor seeded by grandmother’s flight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: regain usable hope after maternal loss. Escalation is textural—each prime-numbered glass piece raises personal investment until tide’s incursion forces relinquishment. No antagonist; pressure is entropic water and internal demand for new syntax. Final option narrowed: she accepts collaboration with chaos, abandons the completed spiral, and exits with unwritten equation—visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: hope as dynamic system, not static value. Tide’s rearrangement reprises grandmother’s 11-second city—both glimpses of order that dissolve yet endure conceptually. Subtext in silence: no direct mention of “grief recovery,” only material negotiations. Final image of clouds releases theme outward without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited retains Maren’s perceptual signature—mathematical yet tactile (“prime numbers, though she did not realize this until the seventh piece”). Rhythm modulates: long cadences for reflection, staccato for bead placement. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Free indirect slips are clean and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences twin image and concept (“water was editing her work”). Metaphors mineral/sky keep consistent field. No filter-verb stacks or loops. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by Maren’s analytical tilt and appears outside peak physical beats. Final line lands with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Grief-work via tidal combinatorics feels fresh; trial-balloon trope literalized in beads then re-inflated as clouds. Grandmother’s ballooning ghost and mother’s quilting scraps synthesize personal myth without nostalgia overdose. Risk in serene/chaos pairing pays off: closure keeps both calm and unsettled in suspension.</comment>
