<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and charged: the “priestess of oblivion” self-label, the bodily memory of pressing every surface for uplink cracks, the exhale after transmit—all embody contradiction without diagnostic speak. One micro-choice chain (read→map→transmit) scales to irrevocable cost; her bravely-conflicted flaw drives each beat. Voice stays singular; no motivation leak. 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she finds the letter, therefore she uses the mapped uplink—choice forecloses safety, felt in the “stone-in-water” chime. Closure is Earned Stasis with cost: the original stays frozen, the ghost escapes, silence re-weights her lungs—cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored by line 3, no telegraphing. Persistent constraint (monitored channel) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library breathes as character: frost creep, 8-meter shelves, snow lung-groan constrain stealth and echo transmit chime. Body-as-micro-setting surfaces in breath-cloud, ear-pool silence, fingers on brittle envelope—each guides micro-choices. Final image re-uses the groan to re-weight her exhalation; environment charges closure. Specific, tactile, never catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose vs. preserve—signaled in para 2; pressure tightens when intimate penmanship makes victims real. One decisive tightening: transmit click forecloses retrieval, stakes pivot from personal guilt to global conversation. Legible causal cost under Causal lens; no off-stage rescue. Could edge 9+ if page showed immediate external consequence cue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—complicity visible through affectionate evil—emerges from handwriting tenderness describing mass murder, never sermonized. Final silence re-weighted: before= oppressive, after= breathable because truth now airborne. Letter’s “contradiction is the sharpest contraband” becomes resonant reconfiguration. No tidy moral, only cost transferred to reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight internal, diction calibrated to Maren’s archival precision: “nitrogen-cooled vaults,” “classification tier,” “dormant networks.” Rhythm mimics breath—long accumulative sentences building pressure, then staccato transmit sequence. No filter-stack, no head-hop. Voice as character succeeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control: “library existed inside the lung of something sleeping” sustains without mixed metaphor. High density—“ghost climbing through the atmosphere” compresses data-transfer and moral release. Opening line stakes, final line image cadence perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Antarctic contraband archive beneath snow is fresh angle; pairing with obsolete uplinks found by touch turns cold-war trope into tactile heist. Intimate letter about genocide delivered in steady penmanship flips villain trope into human-without-excuse. Risk: transmitting truth from impregnable ice-library—stakes invert storage logic. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
