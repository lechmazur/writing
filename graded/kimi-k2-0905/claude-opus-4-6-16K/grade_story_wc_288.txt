<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to isolation yet mourning extinct kin—are embodied in micro-choices: moving books, then choosing not to. The final renunciation (letting mist claim pages) crystallizes her shift to “stationed” with visible cost, cleanly earned. Interiority is concrete, character-bound, and avoids diagnostic labels. Capped at 8.7 because the single-POV default holds, but no second character means relationship crucible bullets are NA and the arc is interior-only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren stands in rising vapor, foreclosing the old protective reflex; cost is legible in the mirrored, undistorted face and the endangered pages she now allows to drown. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal return, memory surges, and object reprise tightens to final cadence shift. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no disorientation claimed. No causality breaks; tidal rule and hum mechanics stay consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal library, brass sundial, and stone-circle hum are not backdrop—they constrain every choice: shelf height, text survival, Maren’s immortality. Micro-setting (sundial’s atomically reflective face) returns in final image to charge her self-recognition. Spatial choreography is clean; vapor ingress is tracked beat-by-beat. Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry extinct life forward vs. surrender to erosion—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: she abandons the rescue ritual; tide’s cost now felt on-page. Escalation is textural—pattern of memory surges and tidal cycles intensifies until she elects to endure rather than resist. Agency is renunciation under coherent pressure; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tidal cycle, mirrored reflection, and relinquished rescue: bearing witness is itself a form of survival. No explicit thesis; final image reweights “isolation” into “independent archive.” Subtext lives in gesture—hand on sundial, mist curling around ankles—never exposition. Complexity preserved: no moral that extinction is “okay,” only that erasure must be lived with.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, elevated register is consistent with centuries-old archivist POV; patterned diction (“atomically reflective,” “velvet neck of the last vaelkross”) teaches its texture early and pays off in final mirror. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory surges, shorter beats for present action. No dialogue, so voice-distinction bullets NA. Psychic distance stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—sensory, emotional, world rule—without scaffold. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop spotted (“she had learned… she had learned”) but outside closure beat and minor. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with tidal rise/fall. No filter-verb stacks or register drift under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Reincarnated archivist tending a cloud-borne library above extinct species is non-obvious synthesis; execution commits fully. Tidal cycle as memory engine and the sundial’s perfect reflection repurposed for self-confrontation feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet lyric ending without external showdown—heightens rather than softens stakes. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing arc.</comment>
