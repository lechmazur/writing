<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s ache for release is embodied in the locust shell and in the burn of her bowing fingers; the waltz she plays is a micro-choice that visibly costs her. The shift from compliant performer to revolutionary orchestrator is legible and earned. One minor slip: “envied it with an ache that surprised her” edges toward label-speak under peak pressure. Otherwise interior contradiction and embodied cost hold cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s rule-set is rewired by Elara’s frequency-waltz, cost paid in dawn grief and the bridge’s warped sway. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density mounts via root-heave, statue-crack, palette return—until the final image reweights beauty as wildness. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. A hairline slack: “she had begun to wonder” is reportage just before the decisive note; tighten to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sky-bridge, granite patrol furrows, and crystal heart-rhythms are tactile constraints that shape Elara’s stealth and final assault. The loosed root that shifts the bridge three feet crystallizes the reconfiguration. One micro-gap: we never feel the bridge planks under her soles during the actual playing, muting full embodiment. Otherwise environment and tool charge every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-awaken beauty vs. mechanical order—tightens when Elara weaponizes the statues’ own pulse; each synched beat narrows her escape options and risks convergence. Cost is visible in scorched fingertips and the grief-edged wonder of dawn. Escalation is single-crescendo under Accumulative lens, sufficient for length. Could edge higher if an earlier beat showed concrete penalty for softer playing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through action: pruned rows explode into unpredictable tangle, reframing beauty as asymmetrical insurgence. The locust shell’s dissolution enacts the moral without pronouncement. Final line—“grief and wonder… grew from the same root”—earns its universality via lived damage. No authorial thesis intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays latched to Elara’s selective attention—mathematical orchard grids, crystal hum, locust husk perfection—creating a perceptual signature that fuses precision and yearning. Syntax modulates from controlled observation to shorter, breath-stacked clauses as roots rupture. No head-hop or register drift. One near-flaw: “second spine” metaphor is vivid but isolated; weave forward for full 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long winding sentences during stealth, fractured fragments as trees wrench free. Figurative language is sparing and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Information density remains high: sky-bridge, violin case, shell, crystal pulse all multitask. A single paraphrase loop—“years in its beautiful cage… years she had spent playing softly”—dulls momentum; trim for 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing bio-acoustic hacking with arboreal revolution feels fresh yet inevitable; the violinist-as-rootkit twist reconfigures familiar “music tames magic” lore. Specificity of crystal heart-rhythms and orchard grid discipline prevents trope recycling. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic city; orchard logic is integral. Risk distinction +0.3 for weaponized waltz that rewrites biome law.</comment>
