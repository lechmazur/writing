<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her synesthetic perception saturates every beat, showing contradictory awe and duty beneath calm ritual. The final strike feels earned because the cavern has already tested her calibrated restraint; the cost is the lifelong tightness she finally exhales. Only a hairline gap: the “proving beauty matters” thesis is named once in reflection rather than left to the image alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white tone fuses sky and glacier, registering undeniable conceptual cost—her private burden is now planetary fact. Accumulative lens holds throughout; each chromatic bloom adds density until the blank measure forces a pattern break. Causality remains intact: every resonance flows from her mallet strike, no late rule adds convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice columns, fossilized amber sheet, and lantern angle track cleanly; spatial choreography never drifts. Environment constrains the climax: only this exact resonant ice geometry could complete the missing note. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s chromatic ear—smell of cedar, violet breath rings—so setting doubles as body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certify wonder—tightens once: the blank measure turns abstract duty into perform-or-fail. Escalation is accretive; each luminous overtone raises the ante until silence itself seems on trial. Cost is visible in the final white fusion that appropriates her private synesthetic gift into the public sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the structural necessity of awe, proved when sound becomes sky. Particulars return reweighted—amber sheet now carries the slept-blue note, redefining “responsibility” as shared atmospheric fact. No moralizing; the image alone reconfigures value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s chromatic perception; diction mirrors her crystalline precision without ever drifting into academic register. Rhythm swells with each bell strike, then thins to breath-length clauses as colors dim. No head-hop, no filter clutter; even the “sculpted hush” is heard-felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long braided coils of color to single-word impacts (“She struck.”). No scaffold, no mixed metaphors; each figure extends the ice-as-instrument conceit. High information density—one blow releases tone, hue, scent, and mythic time—yet clarity never buckles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synesthesia-as-action rather than novelty garnish; fossil-notation as prehistoric grant proposal—both angles feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk taken by staging climax inside pure auroral abstraction pays off because prior beats taught the physics of colored sound. Without these exact elements the story collapses, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
