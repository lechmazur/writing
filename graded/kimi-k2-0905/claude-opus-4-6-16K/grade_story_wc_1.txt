<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—grief over her father’s secret life, need for self-redefinition, fear of leaving the canyon—co-exist in every beat; the final choice to step onto the mountain path costs her the safety of anonymity. Interiority stays rooted in glass-maker perception: light, heat, fracture. One slip: “purpose did not arrive as a blaze” skirts diagnostic label-speak, blunting peak pressure. Otherwise, micro-choices (photographing burns, cataloguing frost, firing the kiln) visibly trace the arc from stunned survivor to deliberate messenger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost → ledger → pendant pattern accumulates until the final image reweights meaning with clear cost (she wears the evidence that can kill her). Orientation is cleanly anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. The single tightening beat—frost decodes coordinates—narrows options from “staying hidden” to “leaving with proof,” paying off under the same lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: options crystallized, price worn at her throat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon sandstone, kiln flame, and shifting frost constrain every move: the narrow sky limits escape, the kiln’s glow risks exposure, frost geometry literally dictates the next step. Sensory detail is filtered through glass-artist priorities: color that has no name, heat moving through silica. The pendant-as-micro-setting lands in the final image, charging closure. Minor over-description of “feathered patterns” stalls momentum for one sentence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she will re-enter the world her father died for—emerges on page 1 and tightens when frost deciphers the ledger; the pendant forges the cost into a single irreversible object. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internalized and coherent. One meaningful escalation: canyon safety vs. mountain risk, crystallized in the pendant she donns. Cost is legible on-page: “she would leave… did not know what she would find.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance-as-obligation emerges through scorch marks, frost grammar, and trapped light—never stated. The final image reframes “pauses” not as absence but as crucible, re-weighting every prior beat. Subtextual irony: the father who taught her to shape light literally burned his truth into darkness. No moralizing; resonance is left glowing around her neck.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—heat gradients, lens curvature, color beyond language. Syntax elongates under reflection, compresses during kiln work, mirroring glass viscosity. No head-hop; unreliability surfaces only through her mis-reading of father’s burns, later corrected. Distinct diction—“molten silica sang,” “stone remembering every sound”—without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive: each sentence doubles duty (world + interiority). One paraphrase loop: “pauses… pauses” in consecutive sentences near end; minor. Metaphors are glass-specific and coherent. Strong information density; no filter-verb stacks. Final line lands clean, rhythmic, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: smuggler’s ledger read through frost dendrites, translated into layered glass—three media braided as insurgent code. Father’s workshop burns reframed as intentional scorched testament flips police procedural cliché. Risk of quiet survivor story in 800 words is high, but pays off via accumulative pattern. Not a retread; specificity prevents swapability.</comment>
