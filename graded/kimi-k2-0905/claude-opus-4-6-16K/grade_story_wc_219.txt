<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—doubt as bright lantern—threads every beat; the amber placement is a micro-choice that crystallizes her shift from observer to participant, paying the cost of stolen permanence. The “luminous skeptic” label never slips into diagnostic talk because her body (coat pocket against ribs, slowed breath) keeps the abstraction felt. Only the final “felt home” line flirts with tidy epiphany; a hairline slip keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (rain-washed stone, pooled sky, amber sun) tightens the stake of manufactured meaning until the closing image reweights it. The 120-word orientation gate is met; tower, spring light, and stolen amber are anchored. Closure is a Charged Poise: the amber remains behind, a conceptual cost that forecloses her former detachment. One sentence of overt thesis (“Homecoming…was the moment suspension ended”) is the single visible seam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain-washed limestone, wild mint, bronze-quiet pool—each tactile detail is filtered through Sera’s skeptical prioritizing gaze. The amber micro-setting constrains the final gesture: its resin weight against her ribs dictates the slow placement on stone. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track footfalls up eroded saints, final basin rim. One extra weather cue could have pushed 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she surrender detachment?—tightens once: amber transferred from pocket to basin, narrowing options from theft to gift. No antagonist needed; the tower’s empty silence is coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, but undeniable: she forfeits the relic that justified her rebellion. A second tightening beat would have lifted it to 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via pattern: suspended flight (fly), suspended meaning (coordinates), suspended self (Sera). Final image releases all three without naming them. The refusal to declare the tower sacred keeps the thematic answer non-literal and resonant. No moralizing, only reconfiguration—exactly what Conceptual Repricing demands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Sera’s perceptual orbit: syntax lengthens under skepticism, shortens at the basin. “Bronze quiet,” “luminous skeptic” are coinages that feel native to her xenolinguist mind. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One clause—“she did not feel guilty”—could have carried more body, the micro-slip that keeps it from 9.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “spring light moved across its stones like something remembering how to speak” advances time, texture, theme. No loops, no mixed metaphors; even the riskiest line—“hydrogen and oxygen finding each other”—earns its place by paying off in the rain-pool image. A single filter verb “she thought about” is the lone scaffold, worth −0.2, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Alien coordinates that manufacture pilgrimage sites is fresh; coupling it with a stolen 40-million-year fly in amber deepens the conceit. The inversion of sacredness-as-projection feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. A hairline echo of Calvino’s “invisible cities” keeps it shy of 9.2.</comment>
