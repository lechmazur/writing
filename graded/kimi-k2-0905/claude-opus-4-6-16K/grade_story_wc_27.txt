<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s barefoot ritual, antique glasses, and climactic decision to transmit are specific and embodied; she never drifts into label-speak. The interior contradiction—resigned yet defiant—is dramatized in her choice to broadcast “whatever broken instruments your grandmothers left you.” Cost is visible: she stakes the last of her purpose on an untested frequency. A second character or status crucible is absent, so relationship pressure is N/A; solo arc alone justifies high-6 entry, execution lifts to 8.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (ritual, ozone, regret) and lands a Charged Poise: the final transmission reweights the lull from failure to compressed potential. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure carries undeniable cost—she may be shouting into vacuum. Persistent constraint (broken transmitter, blocked network) shapes tactics throughout. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment> Repair-bay plating, half-open roof, and lunar grit under bare feet constrain movement and symbolize stalled reach. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, focusing both starlight and plot. Environmental details evolve: hum travels through gantry metal, altering Maren’s stance. Final image of copper-to-violet sky charges the closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—re-ignite a stalled rebellion—is signaled in paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when the stone hum reframes the lull as potential, forcing the transmit choice. Cost is legible: she expends her last secrecy and power on a frequency that may expose her. Escalation is textural, not causal, but coherent under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern: barefoot contact with “truth of surfaces” versus imperial distance. The opera glasses’ generational lineage threads past into present; the hum reweights silence from despair to incubation. Final line refuses moral summary—meaning resides in the act of transmitting. No thematic echo appears; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent: “shoes were barriers” narrates thought without filter clutter. Diction stays within Maren’s plausible lexicon; syntax lengthens under hum-induced serenity, then shortens at the transmit beat. Perceptual signature—grease-blackened soles, braille of rivets—is sharp and sustained. No dialogue to judge; voice alone satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm mirrors emotional swell; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective (“breath made visible”) and does not overwrite the climax. Line density high—each sentence advances image or motive. Minor scaffolding in “ozone and regret” phrase is reused once; insufficient to trigger artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stalled-rebellion trope is refreshed through barefoot ritual and lithic sonics rather than battle plans. Opera glasses as generational tech feels idiosyncratic, not checklist. Risk-taking: climax stakes everything on an ancient hum—specific to this moon, not portable. Synthesis of xenoarchaeology and insurgent hope is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
