<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s exile-inscribed hunger and embodied “aesthetic drive” power every beat; her micro-choice to speak, not chant, rewrites the lattice and costs her outsider certainties. The tremor of recognition inside her sternum shows interior contradiction in scene (beautifully embodied, not diagnosed). No second character dilutes pressure, so the crucible is her against stone, exile, and memory. The earned cost is the moment she becomes the permeable membrane itself—no longer outside or inside, but vibrating with the price of exile’s end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ban lifts → Maren enters → paraphrase choice triggers quartz response → she becomes the membrane; each step narrows options and changes her knowledge of belonging. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Every frozen thing still holds the memory of motion” reweights the premise that sacredness is exclusive. Orientation anchored immediately; no prop drift; final image carries undeniable conceptual cost—her exile now internalized as the new resonance. Lens coherence and cost land cleanly; no causal breaks but a hairline slip in the middle-paragraph spatial tracking of the lake/colonnade boundary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The quartz colonnade itself functions as micro-setting: its vibration frequency literally constrains her voice and final act of boundary dissolution. Frost under boot, cobalt light bruise, cloud stanzas—each sensory detail is POV-filtered and stakes-relevant. Spatial choreography is flawless; distance from lake to atrium to column tracked clearly. The frozen lake’s “memory of motion” returns as charged closure image—environment actively reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove the sacred boundary is permeable while risking irrelevance if the quartz refuses her. Tightening occurs when paraphrase choice forces the stone to answer—either she is validated or exiled anew. Cost is legible: she forfeits the comfort of opposition and now vibrates as the membrane itself, unable to retreat into either camp. Agency is pure—no coincidence; her voice alone escalates resonance from sub-audible to song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of translation: “sacred text” versus “cloud-shadow tongue.” No moral is stated; instead the final image of the lake writing and rewriting its poem answers the thematic question about who owns resonance. Subtext operates in the lantern-moth hush—stillness as the cost of beauty reclaimed. Ambiguity is productive: the reader must decide whether restoration justifies erosion of former priesthood or whether beauty pursued in exile is the only true sanctity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s synesthetic perception; diction (“cloud-shadow tongue,” “whispered chord”) is character-specific and consistent. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for dreamlike entry, then clipped fragments under the tremor. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Voice teaches its elision early (“a sound she could not name but recognized…”) and pays it off in the final line, now fully named by the world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty—advance plot, layer sensory data, and echo metaphors without looping. Zero paraphrase loops; “vibration” recurs but each iteration gains frequency until it becomes the closure beat. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lake as parchment, clouds as stanzas) and never contradict physical logic. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends, sentence-level propulsion flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Few stories dare make prosody itself the MacGuffin; the inversion—unsanctioned poet restores ossified chant by refusing to chant—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The “cloud-shadow poet” trope is totally fresh, not a stock archetype. Synthesis of sound sculpture, exile politics, and aesthetic obsession creates a singular vision. Risk in lyric abstraction is fully rewarded: the ending crystallizes without any explanatory scaffolding.</comment>
