<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to externalize communal grief while guarding her own stillness—plays out in embodied, tool-specific micro-choices (unwinding ribbon, tapping mallet) that visibly cost her calm. The final stance of carrying the dead forward is earned through these pressured, concrete acts; however, the grandmother’s spectral agency occasionally overshadows Elara’s, muting the deepest flaw-compound and capping the score just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens is taught early (ribbon roll, generational poems) and tightens once through the memorial stone’s single carved image; the ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where grief’s weight is simultaneously shouldered and transformed. Causality holds: because each retraced motif compresses five generations into one wing, the butterfly stone becomes the inevitable crystallization; cost is legible in the “sediment settling” moment and the foreknowledge of next year’s return, foreclosing any fantasy of finished sorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s cracked glass and iron bones act as both crucible and sounding board, constraining Elara’s movements and focusing sound so the ribbon ritual can occur; monarchs double as living pigments that stain the light, charging the final butterfly wing image. Selective sensory hierarchy (smell of feral jasmine, patina grit under fingers) filters through a stone-carver’s eye for texture, keeping detail purposeful and thematically mirrored without spillage into tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering grief’s architecture—escalates through the single deepening beat: shifting from reading isolated names to merging fourteen deaths into one communal wing, narrowing options from individual epitaphs to a shared, irreversible design. The price (perpetual annual return of unfinished grief) is felt on the page, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: grief is not merely remembered but structurally inherited, its form rebuilt each generation. Subtext resides in unspoken ribbon names and the monarchs’ wordless tremble, avoiding final-statement moralizing; the ending reweights earlier motifs (wave crest, open book) into a single flight image, offering durable ambiguity about communal versus private memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature: stone-dust taste, color-as-texture syntax, meditative breath-pauses in clause rhythm. Verdigris/cataract metaphors stay within her lapidary lexicon; no head-hop, no filter-verb clog. Compression in the final sentence—“sediment settles”—mirrors her slowed pulse, proving rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and propulsion; high-density lines (“monarchs shifted...light turned amber, then violet”) advance both atmosphere and beat. Occasional stacked epithets (“thundering calm, that silence so full it roared”) flirt with overwriting but are pattern-taught and paid off in closure, so the artifact is minor. No loops, no scaffold, clean grammar; one paraphrase tangent (“community bends...shared mourning”) could be trimmed for final-third excellence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines generational craft lineage with butterfly migration as literal design template—fresh synthesis rather than trope check-list. Memorial-as-wing concept transforms familiar grief iconography into structural necessity; the risk of spectral instruction is balanced by tool-on-stone physicality, making the speculative feel lived-in. Specificity (indigo/copper ribbon, 1923 wave crest) anchors novelty to material culture.</comment>
