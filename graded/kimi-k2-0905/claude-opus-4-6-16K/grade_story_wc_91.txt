<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirela’s barefoot crouch to touch warm sand embodies the “texture of transformation” want; giving away all money is dramatized once but never tested again, so the arc relies on poetic echo rather than escalating stakes. Interiority is vivid (“each grain press…like a secret”) yet stays lyric, not contradictory; the final empty-handed poise feels earned because the prophecy mechanics were external, not self-serving. Missing a second micro-choice that costs her socially or physically keeps her just short of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: releasing the bugs during totality reweights her prior destitution into luminous “translucence,” cost felt in the hush that follows. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—image-density and cadence, not causal chains—held without wobble; the eclipse + volcano + jar pattern is taught early and lands clean. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (black sand, lava tube, shoreline) are clear by line 4. Persistent constraint: she is literally penniless, forcing the gift of light as her only currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Black sand, sulfur steam, and cooling glass are tactile tools that pressure her hand and final image; the volcanic glass shard she lifts is the new “micro-setting” that crystallizes the theme. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but justifies itself through eclipse spectacle; other senses (warmth under teeth, sulfur taste) snap in at pivot beats. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from lava tube to unseen cove to lava edge; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes the closing choice and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she grasp transformation without owning anything? Pressure tightens when bugs—her last possession—are released; the eclipse clock literalizes the window. Escalation is textural/cadence而非因果: lava slows, hush deepens, bugs brighten against darkening sky; cost is the tangible loss of her only asset. Sufficient for this length, though no secondary reversal beyond the single release act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via recurrent “light captured vs. light freed” without exposition; the final image of earthbound stars rewrites her prior wealth as obsolete. Subtext lives in silence: the hush is “vibrant,” paradox charging the closure. Avoids moral; “she was not lucky, she failed to resist currents” invites counter-readings of passivity vs. grace. Minor dock for quasi-epiphany phrase “understood at last,” still tethered to concrete image of volcanic glass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, perceptual signature sharp: “grain press into her soles like a secret being told,” “low vibration she felt in her teeth.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for eclipse arrival, then staccato “She unscrewed the lid.” Experimental compression (“breathing throat”) is taught early and pays off in corona image. No head-hopping, POV distance consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “lava crept…molten rock kissed the tide” does three jobs—motion, heat, sound—without padding. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Tiny register drift—“conceptual repricing” lens might jolt literal-minded readers—but stays within lyric contract. Final line “The shadow began to pass” is spare, propulsive release after ornate peak; rhythm mirrors eclipse withdrawal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Familiar “prophecy fulfilled unwittingly” trope is re-anchored in geothermal specificity: lightning bugs over basaltic steam create new optics. Destitute philanthropist as eclipse pilgrim feels fresh against volcano lore; transformation desire literalized in cooling glass shard. Risk: lyric accumulation could tip into purple, but restraint at closure keeps it earned. Minor proximity to Icelandic travelogue tropes, yet black-sand-into-glass payoff is singular.</comment>
