<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—numb yet questing for sensation—drives every micro-choice from rope-ladder grip to tear-streaked cheek. The spar literalizes the split: Kael-2’s wild strikes embody emotion Kael can no longer feel, while Kael’s exact counters gift structure Kael-2 lacks. The mutual reconstitution is earned: each blow imports voltage, each parry exports scaffolding until both women refuse the original claim. Cost is visible: Kael bleeds sensation back; Kael-2 relinquishes sole motherhood—an irrevocable reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: surgery → numbness → dojo challenge → spar → mutual completion → dual motherhood. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: Kael cries, Kael-2 renounces exclusivity, Shen buries the “proof” brain. Orientation anchored by rope-ladder arrival; historical strata montage stays coherent as externalized pressure. No late rule changes; the custody question is foreclosed by joint refusal rather than adjudication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating basalt dojo weeping mineral water is no postcard: its edges force close-quarters combat, its drift through eroding eras externalizes the women’s mutable identity. The rack-mounted brain-cylinder functions as micro-setting/tool, physically handled twice—first displayed, then interred—charging the final ritual. Wind temperature shifts from indifferent to “cold, alive, beautiful,” mirroring Kael’s returning sensate skin. Spatial choreography across the platform remains clean even during emotional voltage exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who gets to be the “real” mother—tightens when Kael-2’s claim is filed before Kael can feel again. The spar escalates under causal logic: each landed blow narrows options by transferring affective code, forcing both to confront incompleteness. Final renunciation forecloses sole custody without external deus; the price is shared motherhood and burial of genetic proof. Pressure stays coherent; history-rewriting backdrop complicates but does not resolve the fight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as process, not property; motherhood as divisible affective labor rather than biological title. Subtext operates through embodied combat: emotion and structure literally trade fists. Closure’s image—two mothers descending one ladder—reweights the opening question “who is real?” into “what if real is plural?” No moralizing sentence spells the insight; the buried brain is silent testament to obsolescence of singular selfhood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Kael’s perceptual vacuum: “hands that felt like they belonged to someone else,” wind finally “cold, alive, indifferent.” Diction is tectonic—“basalt,” “mineral water,” “strata”—consistent with a mind reassembling from bedrock. Shen’s dialogue slices pretense with Zen economy; Kael-2’s speech burns with recovered feeling, distinct idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under strike-speed without breaking syntax.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet lyric: “the earth’s crust forgot itself and reformed” packs cosmological scale into eleven syllables. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; each figure extends the tectonic motif. Sentence rhythm accelerates during spar—short clauses mimic heartbeat—then lengthens at dawn calm. Information density high: rope-ladder arrival embeds tumor history, wind temperature, and emotional deficit in three lines without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines near-death ego death, cloning ethics, and martial-arts mind-meld into one inevorable arc; none feel grafted. The custody question is inverted: not who keeps the child, but how motherhood multiplies—fresh ethical angle. Historical strata montage externalizes neural stratification, synthesizing world and psyche without overt allegory. Risk-taking in premise pays off: dual-alive mothers refuse binary resolution, reconfiguring identity politics beyond sci-fi trope.</comment>
