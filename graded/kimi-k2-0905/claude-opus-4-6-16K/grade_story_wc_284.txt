<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s scarred hands, pillbox micro-choices, and final decision to scatter the coins all embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the renunciation of literal evidence for remembered truth costs her certainty and safety, earned by prior causal beats. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Kaplan remains off-page, so no relationship crucible tested; still, the solo arc satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s scattering of the coins and turn toward Kaplan crystallize options with visible cost—she relinquishes physical proof and embraces mortal risk. Causal lattice holds: burned escape → pillbox coordinates → snow-grid decryption → renunciation → delegated trust. Lens is cleanly Causal; no orientation debt; cost is legible in the final image (“She walked through”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-slick pines, river-stone taste, and spring-thaw snow-grid directly constrain navigation and decryption; the compass-rose pillbox recharges the final decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate; weather shifts sync with beat tempo. Environment is not merely vivid but tactical, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmit the names without being erased—tightens when Maren chooses to scatter the physical code, trading certainty for delegated courage. One meaningful turn suffices; cost is visible (loss of tangible proof). Agency drives every step; coincidence is absent. Slight reserve: price could be sharper if an on-page threat materialized in the clearing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of entrusted truth emerges solely through image and action—snow as archive, pillbox as sacrament, scattering as consecration. No moralizing; resonance reweights when “unused courage” is handed to Kaplan. Ambiguity lingers: will he act? Complexity embraced. Final image offers non-literal answer to “Who still believes?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical, spy-weary perceptual signature: “coffee tasted of cardamom and endings.” Rhythm modulates from long fugue sentences in ascent to clipped fragments at decryption. No head-hop; elision (“she understood”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct voice persists under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and scaffold-free; figuratives are sparse, precise (“snow’s slow confession”). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory cue, and tactical choice. Minor tic: two adjective-plus-noun pairs (“silver-quiet mist,” “mineral and cold”) border on template, but neither touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cold-war tropes—burned spy, dead drop, mole list—are reanimated through snow-cipher and the sacramental act of vouchsafing. Risk lies in lyric stillness within espionage frame; it pays off. Synthesis feels inevitable: espionage as liturgy, snow as archive. Not radically novel, but angle and execution are fresh.</comment>
