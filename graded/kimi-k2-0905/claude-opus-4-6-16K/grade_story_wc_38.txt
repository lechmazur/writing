<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is lyrically specific—her body reads walls “furred with salt crystal” as Braille—and her calm-defiance motive stays consistent to the final deletion dance. The filial revelation is felt, not told, but the emotional cost is slightly under-cooked: we see her “calm defiance” yet don’t feel the stab of orphan-loss that would make the final liberating pirouette hurt as much as it matters. Still, her micro-choices (roll, decode, delete) map cleanly onto a hierarchy of values: mother’s secret > state secrecy > her own safety. The absence of any second on-page character means relationship/status bullets are N/A; the solo crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: each pirouette is a literal because/therefore key-turn; the dice roll causally triggers which journal scaffold she decodes, culminating in the decisive file deletion that forecloses her own extraction route. Orientation is swift: “sunken laboratory… forty years” anchors where/when in the first dozen words; no penalty. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“the ocean parted” final image reweights her prior entries as irreversible good-bye; the lab’s lights dimming are the visible price. No loops or scaffold; lyric compression is pattern-taught early (“hymn holds a congregation”) and paid off at exit dance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab is not wallpaper; its bioluminescent algae power the console that must be deleted, and the salt-crystal Braille literally guides Maren’s fingers to the journal. Spatial choreography is immaculate—door thresholds, dice roll on metal floor, algae tubes overhead tracked across beats. Micro-setting bonus: her own body becomes a tool/setting when “she danced the second chamber open as a spider spins its web,” fusing body, architecture, and code. Final image of ocean parting recharges the opening “did not see air” with new, breathable meaning—environment charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the named operatives—is signaled the instant she sees the drives. Escalation tightens once: six-scaffold dice roll → final journal entry → irreversible deletion; that single turn narrows her future from spy-heir to fugitive with no data to trade. Cost is legible: drives “hiss and go dark,” algae lights pulse a dying breath—visible price on page. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Calm defiance keeps risk present but slightly blunts visceral fear; still, the conceptual cost of erasing her mother’s life-work is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: encoded love as unbreakable fortress reverses into decoded love as weapon against the state. The hangman dice re-price from random cipher to filial heartbeat; vulnerability-as-weapon idea is conceptual repricing realized in the deletion hiss. Final image answers the thematic question—can inherited code be freedom?—by letting ocean literally open a path, a non-literal, resonant answer. No thematic echo sentence; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Maren’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction stays within her polymath poet-coder lexicon—“encrypted architectures,” “cadence of the cipher”—without academic drift. Rhythm mirrors content: long, web-spinning sentences for dance sequences, staccato “She executed the deletion” for terminal beat. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; voice distinction met via singular perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “fluorescent tubes overhead still flickered with bioluminescent algae that the original researchers had engineered before the flood took them and their secrets beneath the continental shelf” delivers setting, backstory, and stakes. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent (hymn/fortress/web). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph breaks coincide with micro-turns (finding journal / deleting files). Zero artifacts in final third—closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: filial spy thriller told as underwater dance-poem with gallows dice as randomizer. Vulnerability-as-encryption is a non-obvious moral calculus that flips standard strong-female trope into something subtler. Risk—lyric mode, solo POV, no antagonist—pays off by making deletion feel like final pirouette. Specific detail (salt-crystal Braille, geothermal algae) prevents abstract drift; removal would collapse both world and metaphor. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
