<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s silence and custodial ritual are vividly embodied; the prism-touch visions give concrete interiority and a credible paranormal limit. The final act of re-lighting is earned by her nightly charting and star-math, paying the cost of eleven days of wordless vigil. The only bar to 9+ is that the trader-child pivot is off-stage; Maren never reacts to the incoming footsteps, so the social consequence is inferred rather than felt by her in-scene.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the fracture becomes the very aperture that births a new spectrum, proving pattern out of collapse. The lens holds Accumulative/Textural: each nightly humming pane and star notation thickens texture until the chord ruptures into color. Cost is legible in the single line “holding the shard of hush like a seed against her chest”—the wound is kept, not healed. Orientation, transitions, and causality remain clean; no world-rule cheats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass panes, tower stairs, and cracked prism are handled, not catalogued; their acoustic and optical behavior directly shapes Maren’s choices. Temperature-shifted harmonics constrain when she climbs, and the prism’s fracture angle dictates the alignment moment. The micro-setting (the shard itself) charges the final image. A hairline slip: “dead highway” is the only visual that feels generic, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove cosmic intention—threads every beat: charting hum-hours, grinding star notes, risking oil she cannot replace. Pressure tightens when the prism crack forces a one-night alignment window; failure means permanent silence. No external antagonist is needed; the universe’s indifference is the pressure. Cost is visible—she keeps the broken shard, embracing imperfection—but the off-page child caravan slightly dilutes the immediacy of consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the rebuttal of entropy: fracture can be aperture, collapse can be grammar. Subtext lives in the unspoken chord between two women centuries apart, both refusing randomness. The final spectrum is a non-literal answer—no moral stated, only color that reweights every prior pattern. One minor echo risk: “sentence in a longer story” flirts with meta-commentary but is saved by its placement mid-text, not at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a hush-compressed cadence—long vowels, sibilants—that mirrors the glass hum. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as alignment nears, then bloom into the final polysyllabic “thistle-blown, stubborn, finding root in gravel.” No head-hop; every perception is Maren-bound. The single line of reported speech (“asked her father what it meant”) is cleanly outside her POV and justified by narrative distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances star-math, prism handling, or acoustic detail. Metaphors are coherent—light as grammar, fracture as aperture—and never layered to opacity. One scaffold risk: “still, she climbed… still, she lit” reads as deliberate anaphora; if accidental, it’s minor. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed vehicles, and the final chord sentence propels closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-keeper is familiar, but the fusion of retrocognitive lens-making with acoustic astronomy feels newly soldered. The broken prism refracting hope through its own wound is an image that retroactively reweights every prior detail. Risk is taken in choosing silence as protagonist, yet it pays off in thistle-blown hope. The synthesis is specific enough that swapping names would break the resonance.</comment>
