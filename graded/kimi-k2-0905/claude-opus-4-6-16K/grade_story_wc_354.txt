<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular—thumb-callus, worry-stone dent, chessboard silence—and her renunciation at the nexus is earned by prior causality. The only flaw is a trace of self-diagnostic summing-up (“she almost laughed… knowing mattered”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: exile → study of absence → recognition that attention itself renews → declarative act that costs her remaining mobility. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible price—she stays, foregoes return, and the warm dent in the stone certifies the cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is never static description; its humming, sky-curtains, and compass-spirals constrain her tactics (she must sit, listen, speak within the four-day tide). The worry stone functions as micro-setting, its evolving temperature and dent tracking the covenant’s re-activation and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“restore the covenant before dormancy”—is signaled early and tightens once when she realizes intention itself is the missing character. The price is legible (permanent exile crystallized into chosen vigil), though the external world offers no antagonistic pushback beyond environmental quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: absence as legible language, attention as covenant, exile as post. The final image reweights the whole without moralizing—difficult and beautiful collapse into the same magnetic breath. No redundancy, no echo-statements; the silence does the talking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter—compass spirals, chess architecture, stone-warmth—syntax lengthens with reflection, then tightens into the spoken three-sentence renewal. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice modulation tracks the magnetic cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often performs atmosphere, interiority, and causal nudge simultaneously. Only a single paraphrase loop (“difficult, lonely, beautiful work”) stalls for a beat; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene temperature and ends on the resonant noun “song.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise of mineral-attention covenant is made specific through chess pedagogy of reading absence; the inversion of exile into chosen office feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyrical structure holds without gimmick, and the worry-stone motif is transformed from comfort tool to covenant register.</comment>
