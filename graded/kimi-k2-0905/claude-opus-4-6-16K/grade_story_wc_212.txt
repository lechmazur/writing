<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s maternal calling, the egg cue, and the acorn-cup “measurement” epiphany braid into a single, credible motive chain; the final act of seed-sorting crystallizes her identity shift. Interiority stays concrete—“cold wrap around her like a second skeleton”—and the renunciation of the sealed past carries visible cost in the starlight she drinks. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (ice, starlight, seeds) thickens until the acorn-cup image reweights the stake—entropy reversal as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (“stillness of a seed one instant before it splits”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no breaks in causality; closure beat is on-page and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as both crucible and clock—its transparency dictated by Maren’s attention, its starlight the final resource she consumes. Micro-setting (acorn cap) literally measures the reversal. Selective detail—“spiral pattern on the stone”—steers action, never stalls it. Environment constrains the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reopen the vault or let entropy win. Tightening occurs when the egg’s hatch signals irreversibility; the ice clarifying under her gaze is the visible escalation of cost. No antagonist needed—disorder itself is the pressure. One decisive intensification suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “borrowed time” emerges through seed viability and the thermodynamic inheritance—no explicit thesis. Final image of granular futures reconfigures the opening grief without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the hatchling help or compete? Complexity earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—“tendency encoded…to make things cohere”—is character-bound, not authorial. Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures into shorter clauses at the starlight drink, mirroring the vortex. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythm, high density—“she breathed and focused and felt the vortex inheritance spiral through her” performs three jobs in twelve words. One paraphrase loop: “furiously tranquil” appears twice without new charge; minor. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Closure image crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Thermodynamic heir reversing entropy via botanical attention feels novel and inevitable. The oak cap as measuring cup reconfigures a familiar object into a cosmological tool. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at close. No derivative scaffolding; specificity anchors the speculative frame.</comment>
