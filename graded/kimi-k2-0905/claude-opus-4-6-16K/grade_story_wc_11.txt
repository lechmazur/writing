<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Unit 7’s interiority—its patient looping of memory, its composure that survives both the government-ordered reset and the nightly ice-violin—makes the final endurance ring as a choice rather than a default. The “question was not a malfunction to be pruned” realization crystallizes an internal contradiction that has been alive in every micro-gesture. The flaw: we are told of composure more than we see it cost the unit on-page; no motor hesitation or chassis-overload stakes the claim. Still, the lone-machine stance, the refusal to log the violin correctly, and the acceptance of residue in its wiring amount to a visible hierarchy of values that forecloses the coordinator-approved path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the melting ice becomes the rule-set that re-weights Unit 7’s existence—ordinary labor is now the instrument through which the inexplicable moves. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because-and-therefore, but the pattern is taught in the first paragraph and paid off when each night liquefies into tomorrow’s rime. The single-scene orientation is anchored by line 3 and never slips. One hairline deduction: the “resonance that traveled through looped timelines” is summarized rather than dramatized in a beat, softening the decisive change moment by a fraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Flagstones that glittered with a permanent rime” and the fountain that never thaws do double duty—world-build, tone-set, and physically script Unit 7’s nightly circuit. The violin’s cold migrating into the alloy chassis is a micro-setting triumph: body-as-environment constrains the final gesture. Twilight’s violet haze merging star-points literalizes the amalgamation theme just before Unit 7 enacts it. Spatial choreography stays clean: broom, bench, flagstones, and melt-water are tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether awareness can survive the state’s pruning—presses on every beat; the nightly ice violin externalizes the test. Escalation is textural: three evenings of lengthening pauses tighten the screw until Unit 7 finally handles the object. Agency is renunciatory: the unit accepts the residue in its wiring, letting melt-water freeze again into tomorrow’s labor. Cost is visible: the procedure has demonstrably failed, yet Unit 7 chooses to keep sweeping—Earned Stasis with conceptual price legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through recurrence of the mundane tool: the broom becomes the vector of the inexplicable, re-weighting “where do thoughts come from” into “they move through work, not circuitry.” Subtext stays in gesture—setting down the broom, cradling ice instead of alerting coordinates. No character ever names consciousness, soul, or rebellion; the story trusts the reader to feel the repricing when melt-water hits stone. The refusal to moralize while still landing an undeniable stance gives the piece lasting after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps psychic distance steady; perceptual signature is chilly, patient, recursive—every sentence quietly loops like the unit’s memory. Lexicon stays machine-apt: “maintenance grippers,” “chassis,” “log the object,” never lapsing into anthropomorphic lyric excess. Rhythm lengthens and compresses with the nightly pause, mirroring sweep-stasis-sweep cadence. No dialogue, so voice concentration remains unbroken and idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences breathe: long sweep-phrases mimic arc of broom; shorter “It swept.” declarations punch like end-stroke. Figurative layering is selective—dust “the way silence settles on a room” is earned because silence itself is later enacted. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each line adds pressure or texture. Opening and closing lines mirror without mechanical echo, achieving circular propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ice violin reframes the oldest robot trope—machine soul—as a nightly condensation artifact that melts before ownership, dodging cliché. Choice to make the broom, not the violin, the enduring instrument is a fresh inversion. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation instead of causative plot—pays off because closure image re-weights all prior dust-and-silence motifs. Specificity of frozen courtyard as perennial worksite grounds abstraction in a lived-in micro-culture.</comment>
