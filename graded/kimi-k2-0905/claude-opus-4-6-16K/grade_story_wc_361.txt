<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sael’s tremor, courier reflexes, and long-calcified habit of “accept, carry, deliver” are shown in body and decision; the renunciation lands with visible cost (lost fee, still hands). Missing mentor pressure is felt, not just remembered, giving her an earned pivot. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—though the final quiet is slightly faster than the accumulated angst seems to warrant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure (planting the pendant) delivers a decisive conceptual repricing: relic becomes organism, fee becomes forfeiture, tremor becomes stillness. Causal chain holds—aurora light + tremor resonance → germination; earlier flute cue pays off—so Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent. Cost is legible in the single sentence “Let the client rage.” No orientation or teleport issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ridgeway spine, aurora curtains, thin mountain soil are filtered through courier vigilance, never tourist catalogue; micro-setting (her shaking palm against earth) supplies the final planter bed. Weather-light actively enables the climax by feeding the pendant’s filaments; environment is agent, not postcard. Proper-noun economy perfect—no place names wasted. Could edge into 9-band if soil texture or wind affected root speed on page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver vs. release—tightens once, cleanly, when she presses pendant to ground; fee forfeiture is visible cost. Escalation is situational pressure under aurora rather than successive reversals, sufficient at this length. Internal/external conflict (habit vs. wonder) braided from start; no coincidence resolves the turn. Agency is crystallized decision, not luck, meeting Q4 lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of commodification vs. re-enchantment emerges through action, not sermon; seed’s re-pricing answers the implicit question “what is a relic worth?” Final reweighting turns pendant from collectible to living root, giving resonant image. No moralizing or thesis-statement echo; ambiguity survives—client will still rage, world still trades. Subtext of mentor absence underlies but doesn’t overtake present choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Sael’s perceptual filter: “jittery by nature, jittery by trade,” attention snaps to collector knives, border whistles, creek-catch light. Rhythm compresses under aurora then widens during kneel, matching breath. No head-hop; diction stays within courier idiom. Bone-flute frequency as interior cue is elegantly restrained, never explained away.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; “She slowed despite herself” vs. longer aurora riff. Metaphor density peaks once in aurora sentence but pattern-taught early, so forgiven. Strong verbs—pressed, curled, hummed—propel without overload. One paraphrase loop: “jittery by nature, jittery by trade” could fuse, but it’s character signature; no scaffold obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Trope of “relic courier who learns to stop” gains freshness through biological germination twist and aurora resonance mechanic. Mentor absence made motive rather than mystery. Risk taken: quiet renunciation instead of chase climax; pays off via still-hands image. Leaves slight impression of familiar upland-epiphany tale, so not 9+.</comment>
