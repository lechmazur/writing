<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s compulsive tapping embodies contradictory impulse: calming ritual vs. index of rising dread; the final silence is earned cost. Coral-memory interiority is concrete, not therapeutic. No second character, so relationship crucible waived. Backstory reflections (≤20%) anchor in present stimuli and tilt her stance—meets BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tapping + tide imagery tightens until atlas-page glow reweights stakes. Closure: Charged Poise; cost legible in “enormous” silence and looming decades of collapse. Orientation anchored by word 50; one clean scene. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (void collapse) shapes final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Steel console, torn atlas, and window-lit Atlantic are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. Atlas page micro-setting reappears at closure, charging the final image—meets 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clear; no prop drift. Weather and station tech affect Lena’s noticing but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why coasts vanish—signaled early; subsidence revelation tightens stakes under Accumulative lens. Agency: cross-referencing data → renunciation of false hope; cost visible in stopped tapping and ghost-island image. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “paths erased from below” emerges from void-collapse premise and atlas image, never moralized. Final translucency reprises dotted lines with conceptual cost—CR. Subtext in tapping silence vs. eternal tides. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual signature; diction fuses scientific precision with lyrical guilt. Tapping rhythm taught early, modulates under stress, pays off in final keystroke cadence. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect clean; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (sonar, tourniquet) mixed but coherent within physical logic. High info density—each line advances character, image, or causality. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise refreshes climate-fiction trope: sea-level rise driven by sub-sea void collapse—specific, non-obvious. Atlas page as palimpsest of erasure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring stakes. Could swap Pacific past for any reef work—minor universality slip keeps sub-9.</comment>
