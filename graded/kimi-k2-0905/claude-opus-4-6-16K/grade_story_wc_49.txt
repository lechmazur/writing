<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from “wrench” to “voice” is dramatized through embodied micro-choices: oil-stained fingers curl around a vine, her throat tightens on the first dead-word note, the tendril answering in real time. Interior contradiction is alive—she mocks her own singing even as desperation compels it—yet the story hedges the final cost: we don’t see what she must give up or relearn, only success. That softens the arc from “credible endurance with cost” to “competence re-skilled,” capping the score just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is renewed on-stage, fruit visible, villagers humming, meaning system reweighted from mechanical to sonic agriculture. Causal chain holds—journal discovery → trial song → tendril response → full harvest—each because/therefore link tight, no off-stage shortcuts. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal sacrifice, but the final image of communal bewilderment under the moon makes the price of cultural amnesia felt, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Arbor is handled as tactile machine: copper trellis, mirror rigs, sap and oil mixing under fingernails. Dawn light and vine tension constrain every move; when the tendril unfurls it reconfigures the physical stakes. Micro-setting (the vine in her palm) literally tightens the world to a single green muscle, charging the final image. One notch off 9 only because spatial anchors (gate, wall) are mentioned once and never used again.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the arbor—tightens through successive failures of hardware, then narrows to one option: sing or lose everything. Mid-story micro-turn: first tremor of the tendril forecloses purely mechanical solutions. Pressure is coherent but incremental rather than spiking; cost is collective forgetting, not personal loss, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band that demands a sharper, protagonist-specific price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as sonic agronomy versus industrial forgetting; no character ever names it. The harvest moon reweights from decorative sky-orb to contractual witness without exposition. Final image—baskets filling while elders half-remember lyrics—offers ambiguity: restoration or fragile reprieve? No moral spoken, only共振 reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter: gears taste like chalk in her mouth, music feels “wrong to modern ears.” Syntax lengthens and relaxes as her voice steadies, rhythmic mirror of vine response. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; even lyric passages remain tool-specific and oil-scented. Distinct texture sustained under pressure, earning the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: sentences lengthen from staccato tool-clicks to legato melody lines, matching stakes. No loops, no scaffold; “tendril… curled inward like a fist refusing to open” condenses three jobs (visual, kinesthetic, emotional) in one image. One mixed metaphor—“harvest moon was… a covenant”—is forgiven because the story literalizes it by closure. Peak beats stay lucid; figurative language never obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines biopunk tinkerer with forgotten phonobiology, a synthesis not seen in slush. Risk: singing to plants could slide into twee, but the piece grounds effect in generational engineering, averting sentimentality. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Slight deduction for familiar “dying ancestral orchard” scaffold; the sonic twist rescues but doesn’t fully transcend trope roots.</comment>
