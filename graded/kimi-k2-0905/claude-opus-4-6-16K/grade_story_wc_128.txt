<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and occupation-specific; the “stone” of gratitude and the micro-choice to hand-deliver the letter crystallize motive. Oren remains thinner—his guarded warmth is evoked but not tested under pressure—so the relational crucible never fully ignites. The final renunciation of named credit is credible and scaled to length, yet the emotional cost is asserted more than embodied. Still, contradictory impulses (shrewd broker vs. open listener) coexist cleanly in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: mis-delivery → curiosity → encounter → reciprocal programs → widened circle, each step a because/therefore. The single transition from pier memory to rooftop terrace is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “different calculus” reweights Maren’s world with undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits ego-billing forever. The lens stays causal throughout; no off-stage shortcuts or lucky rescues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt air, solar fairy lights, and tide table as poetry are selective and filtered through Maren’s professional eye. The rooftop canopy and turning sky function as micro-setting that literally hosts the new reading circle, so environment constrains final action. Spatial choreography is clean—envelope hand-off, photo drop, bodies seated—no ghost props. One minor over-label: “rare coastal institutions” reads guidebook, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—visibility for invisible labor—is signaled early and tightens when Maren chooses to fund an anonymous program; the option to keep billing her own name is foreclosed. A single meaningful escalation: the tally clerks’ unseen weight shifts to shared communal space on the terrace. No antagonist needed; internal/external pressures (guilt, professional identity) interlace cleanly. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: she surrenders reputational profit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassion-as-cycle emerges through器物: envelope, photo, reading circle—never stated as thesis. Final image of “different kind of music” reweights prior brokerage arithmetic without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence—Oren touching the photo edge, Maren listening “with focused attention she usually reserved for contracts.” Ambiguity remains: brokerage profits still flow, but ego currency is quietly devalued.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren; perceptual signature mercantile—she sizes handwriting like a jeweler. Syntax flexes with emotional lift: longer lyrical cadence on the terrace, clipped logistical diction in office recall. No dialogue required; when Oren speaks it is spare, fitting a tally clerk unaccustomed to being sought. Filter verbs minimal; “the photo asked her to” is an active, character-specific projection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propulsion high; information dual-loaded (“she had built her brokerage on the invisible labor of such people, and the knowledge sometimes sat in her chest like a stone”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One scaffold phrase—“she decided to initiate contact, not to correct the mail but to deliver it”—could compress, but it does not recur. Final image is clean, rhythmically satisfying.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “wrong-address friendship” trope is refreshed via maritime logistics and occupational guilt, not rom-com fate. Specificity of Busan dock, bill-of-lading vision, and anonymous funding move it far from generic feel-good territory. Risk is modest—structure is linear—but the synthesis of commerce and compassion feels inevitable in hindsight. Could push further into Oren’s interior for true dual arc, yet remains memorably particular.</comment>
