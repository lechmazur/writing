<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s want-to-learn stance stays believable; her micro-choice to accept the brass seal visibly costs her prior neutrality. Cassia’s “everything lies” creed is shown through gesture, not label, and her gift of the seal crystallizes their shifting power balance. The only flaw is a trace of convenience: Maren’s sudden “Teach me Sumerian” beats feel slightly unseeded in prior interiority, nudging motivation from 9.0 to 8.6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the kettle, herbs, and silent rooftop reweight the stake—renovation will erase nothing save their listening ritual. Cost is unmistakable: they keep meeting while walls are wrapped in plastic, choice foreclosed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tea, each cuneiform card thickens the pattern until the final image detonates meaning. No orientation lapses; the rooftop meteor-shower anchor is clear by word 108.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro and specific: the lavender housecoat, brass initials, rosemary scent among chimney caps. These objects constrain choice—Maren can’t learn without Cassia’s rooftop key—and charge the final meteor-lit image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track every terra-cotta pot and blanket. Weather (meteor shower) is not backdrop but the moment’s spotlight, reconfiguring value in real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the building’s voice—tightens when each cuneiform lesson costs complicity with inevitable loss. No antagonist beyond time/developers, yet each Tuesday forecloses another future Tuesday once renovation starts. visible price: the developers arrive in spring and the sugar cup gathers dust, signaling the ritual’s finite span. Escalation is accumulative: each layer of language learned deepens the impending silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of “preservation as shared lie” emerges organically: the seal, the sugar ruse, and renovation layers all rest on collective fictions. Final image—dusty cup beloved—reprises the opening lie with affection, reweighting it from means to meaning. No explicit moralizing; wisdom is earned through tactile particulars. The reader leaves feeling complicity itself is the only honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual filter: her noticing of “intertwined initials” and “owlish” glasses is character-specific. Syntax modulates: short clauses under meteor shower mimic held breath. No dialogue convergence; Cassia’s diction (“Sumerian lied beautifully”) remains distinct from Maren’s interior register. Occasional elevated phrase (“phosphorescent line”) nudges slightly above Maren’s plausible lexicon, keeping voice just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences do double duty: “Each movement precise yet unhurried” reveals Cassia and foreshadows cuneiform economy. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for tea steam, staccato for meteor bursts—without drumbeat pattern. Final line is a perfect inverse of opener, achieving circular density without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusing dead-language philology with architectural conservation is fresh; the rooftop-as-clay-tablet metaphor makes the synthesis feel inevitable. Brass seal and sugar ruse transform familiar mentor-student beats into something specific and risky. The agreement that lies can be beloved pushes moral complexity beyond easy irony. Transformation test: swap elements and the entire emotional calculus collapses—high originality.</comment>
