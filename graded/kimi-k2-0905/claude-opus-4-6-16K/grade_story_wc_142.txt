<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s “shock absorber” identity is shown through concrete actions—painting code, pocketing the stone—but interiority remains generic: “she loved… she understood.” No simultaneous contradictory impulse is staged in the present; the split allegiance is asserted, not dramatized. The final stance (“we only need forty”) is belief, not renunciation, so cost is prospective, not paid on the page. Secondary pressure from Olu arrives late and resolves off-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mural and forty-day promise reconfigure options with plausible social cost under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean by 120 words; the graffiti code pattern is taught early and paid off at the end. A single shard with one interior loop; stays within scope. The price (gentrification encroaching) is felt but not yet internalized by Maren, so cost is conceptual, not personal—keeps it from 8-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is vivid, selective: warm Pacific drift, espresso machines, copper lanterns—details filtered through Maren’s planner-eye. The raft city constrains movement and tactics (painting at midnight on a pontoon) and the stone chip acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating rooms. Just shy of 8.5 because environment does not physically impede the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community ownership vs privatization—signals early and tightens once: graffiti tally proves charter ready, narrowing options to maritime filing. Escalation is textural (density of coded murals) rather than causal reversal; coincidence is absent. Cost is social, not personal, visible in espresso/ordinance intrusions. Could reach 8.8 if Maren forfeited a private dream on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: cultural translation as living architecture. Motif of painted code shifts from decoration to ballot, reweighting meaning without moralizing. Final image of drums-not-stopping offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo or tidy thesis stated; ambiguity lingers. Lacks deeper irony or counter-reading to push above 8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s planner perception: “dense with symbolic weight.” Syntax is rhythmic, controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Voice distinctiveness is steady but not yet idiosyncratic enough for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete nouns/verbs. High information density: “drumlines rattled… streamers like synaptic threads.” One paraphrase loop: “always been in the process of becoming and now, perhaps, was finally deciding…” No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Clean grammar; only minor loop keeps it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Floating gentrification battle via coded graffiti is fresh synthesis; premise not a template echo. Specificity—stone chip as ballot seal, cooperative charter via indigo spiral—grounds novelty. Risk in carnival-as-civic-process pays off. Could ascend to 9 with sharper personal cost.</comment>
