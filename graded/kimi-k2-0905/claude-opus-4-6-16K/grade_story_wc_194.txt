<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s poised silence and instinctive “bridge of intuition” are vividly particular; the moment she pockets the crank and ledger crystallizes her costly shift. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract. Yet the dynasty’s collapse is declared, not dramatized, trimming the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causality is airtight: the crank fitted → standing waves → shelf opens → ledger read → dynasty doomed. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: “The Valderon dynasty would not survive.” Lens (Causal) holds without wobble; every beat tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia reading room is tactile and lived-in—patinated brass, dust-thickened light, resonant shelves—each detail bends choice (crank fit, shelf resonance). Micro-setting (false book spines) directly enables revelation. Minor surplus adjectives cap at 8.9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dynasty’s guilt versus Elara’s conscience—tightens once: ledger exposes irreversible corruption, foreclosing her silence. Agency is clear: she turns the crank, reads, decides. Cost (dynastic suicide) is legible. One escalation suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence versus resonant truth emerges concretely through acoustics and ledger; no thesis stated. Final image of golden shadows “closing like a book” reweights all prior sepia nostalgia into moral verdict. Complexity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s calibrated stillness; perceptual signature (“angle of her jaw”) recurs without repetition. Syntax modulates with pressure—long reflective coils vs. clipped “She closed the ledger.” Distinct, controlled, publish-level voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences layer sensory and causal work without scaffold. No mixed metaphors or filler loops. Only hairline surplus in adjectival sepia layering keeps from 9.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Acoustic‐resonance-as-family-exposure feels fresh; the gramophone crank engraved with “frequencies rendered as waves” is particular and irreversible. Risk lies in quiet renunciation rather than set-piece twist, coherent with voice. Not groundbreaking but memorably angled.</comment>
