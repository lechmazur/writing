<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—repulsion at her father’s fraud and recognition of its living utility—are kept active across the reflective beats; the final renunciation of exposé for salvage is fully motivated by the eleven-year quest and the canal-side micro-choice to set the sundial down, paying visible cost in abandoning the “purer truth” she once hunted. Interiority is particular and embodied (“serene upheaval,” boots over water), never drifting into label-speak. Only the absence of on-page opposition keeps this from 8-plus territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “lie-becomes-ground” is taught early, density grows through layered examples, and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—her decision to chronicle rather than demolish reweights every prior belief. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props. The single meaningful tightening—shifting from exposure to preservation—carries unmistakable cost (she forfeits moral high-ground and academic certainty), satisfying 9+ quick test requirements for closure with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Canal, houseboat prow, pocket sundial, and twilight sky are filtered through Maren’s selective fatigue; bruised-silver water and the breathing-lap of hull couple directly to her dawning acceptance, constraining her final stillness. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene. While environment mirrors mood, it never physically obstructs or resourcefully enables choice, keeping this just under the 9-band gate that demands setting alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“comprehend versus destroy fabricated legends”—is signaled in the third sentence and tightens once: the realization that communities have rooted identity in the false tales forces her salvage-or-expose fork. Agency is internal but decisive; the salvage choice forecloses the exposé path with felt reputational and moral cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. A visible price (abandonment of “purer truth” mission) is on the page, meeting high-band cost legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the architecture of lies becomes lived truth, so the only honest act is description, not demolition. Subtext resides in objects—sundial useless in darkness, radio silent between cycles—both quietly arguing that function depends on context. No explicit moralizing; final image of resumed broadcast and eventual daylight reweights everything without stating a thesis. Complexity is honored: Maren neither forgives her father nor spares herself complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Free-indirect style sustains a controlled, lyrical distance that matches the twilight mood; perceptual signature is sharp (“water the color of bruised silver,” “scaffolding around nothing”). Syntax lengthens in contemplative beats, compresses at the micro-turn (“she would write the book—not the exposé...”), mirroring cognitive shift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction stays within Maren’s reflective lexicon. Rhythm and metaphor remain coherent even at peak pressure, meriting high-band placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: information dual-loads without paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (architecture, gardening, radio silence). One mixed image—“sentence that refused to end”—is minor against overall clarity. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold repetition; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final beat maintains lucid figurative control, satisfying 9– gate minus a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the familiar “expose the fraud” arc into “document the fraud that has become heritage,” yielding fresh moral calculus. Father-as-legend-forger is specific enough to escape trope; canal-night epiphany is not a recycled image. Risk resides in eleven-year retrospective compression, but accumulative structure justifies the brevity. Synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
