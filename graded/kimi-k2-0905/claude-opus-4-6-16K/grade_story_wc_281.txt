<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s skeptical affection is shown, not told—she laughs at Jonah’s claim, then demands peer review. Her refusal to accept “unmapped” territory drives every micro-choice: darkening the studio, tracking galvanic skin response, holding his hand while he bleeds. The final line—“I’m always the data”— crystallizes her worldview and the relationship’s re-negotiated intimacy. Jonah’s post-shock fragility is embodied (flinching at proximity, white knuckles), but his interior contradiction is reported rather than staged in scene, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shutter clicks, light branches across the wall, and the couple inhabit a “navigable” but still-fragile boundary—cost felt in the conditional “something like a way home.” Accumulative lens holds: each long-exposure photograph layers a denser map of self/other, reweighting stakes without causal reversal. Orientation is clean (studio, March, after-recall) by line 4. The only drag is a single compressed block of backstory/explanation (“She read Damasio…”) that slightly dilutes present momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting: its spectral scatter literally calms Jonah’s synaptic storm and constrains Maren’s experimental tactic. Light wavelengths, blackout curtains, and camera shutter create a tactile, lived-in workspace that governs every action. Environmental detail is selective—spectral whispers, recursive pupils—never tourist-catalog. Final image of “branching, hopeful lines” recharges the studio’s optical palette, locking setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore Jonah’s violated self-boundary—declared in recall paragraph. Mid-story tightening: Maren pivots from reading papers to painting with refracted light, narrowing options from medical to somatic. Cost is legible—Jonah still flinches, grip leaves both sets of knuckles white—but the escalation is more accumulative (each photo adds boundary) than a single decisive reversal. Sufficient for length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through prismatic light: love as empirical method, intimacy as data-forged map. No moralizing; final “willow glass” image reweights earlier skepticism into tender empiricism. Subtext in gestures—hand-grip, angle of geode—carries the emotional dialectic. Complex ambiguity remains: the map is still fragile, the home only “something like” reachable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Maren’s perceptual bias: light fractions, heart-rate percentages, affectionate doubt. Syntax lengthens during exposures (“branching patterns—dendrites of refracted color…”), then compresses under stress (“He almost smiled”). No head-hopping; Jonah’s interior is inferred through body data, maintaining distance control. Distinct rhythmic signature sustains across scientific and tender registers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty: “pupils fractally precise—dilated in recursive geometric patterns” packs sight, metaphor, and medical stakes. No filler loops; each clause advances atmosphere or causality. Figurative language is patterned (storm, glass, cartography) yet internally coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with shutter speeds—long exposure prose vs. staccato diagnostics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Telepathy-side-effect and optic-somatic therapy feel fresh, not recycled sci-fi. Conceptual risk—using a mineral flake as neural stylus—pays off in closure image. Could veer into gimmick but stays grounded in relationship stakes. Specificity of “muscovite: a layered silicate” counters generic miracle cure, earning the extra tenth.</comment>
