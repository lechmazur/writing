<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yael’s interior contradiction—career navigator who must unlearn the sky—drives every beat; the weeping moment embodies cost without therapy-speak. Micro-choice of setting the chain on the gel table crystallizes her renunciation of surface certainties. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; head-count clarity perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the neutrino sky reweights her entire life with visible cost—“she wept.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “unfolded horizons” deepens until the final curriculum lines land. Orientation anchored by word 40; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint—oceanic pressure—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Benthic city constrains breathing, movement, and perception; the corroded chain link micro-setting reorients her understanding. Sensory hierarchy filtered through naval professionalism—pressure as compass, corrosion as map. Spatial choreography clean: habitat module → corridor → charting table. Final image of gel ripple reuses setting as closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn alien navigation or remain ignorant—tightens when she realizes human methods are “shadows.” One meaningful deepening: neutrino charts collapse her epistemic confidence. Cost legible in tears and new curriculum; no coincidence. Agency maintained throughout; no external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via edge-geometry metaphor: boundaries are negotiable, not fixed. Subtext in anchor chain—human wreckage re-encoded into alien star-map—renders universality without statement. Final curriculum lines offer resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity about what she forfeits lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Yael’s perceptual filter—naval metaphors, stellar vocabulary. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, fragments under pressure (“She wept.”). No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Prose mirrors her methodical mind yet lifts into lyric awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong; opening anaphora “Six weeks…” establishes cadence then yields to shorter propulsive units. Figurative language disciplined—mixed metaphors absent. One minor scaffold: “frozen lightning” and “frozen certainties” within 80 words; not repeated in closure zone. No filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutrino starlight as felt compass transforms familiar first-contact trope. Anchor-chain object repurposed as philosophical instrument feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky deep-sea cityscape executed without infodump. Specific naval expertise lends authenticity unavailable to generic templates. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
