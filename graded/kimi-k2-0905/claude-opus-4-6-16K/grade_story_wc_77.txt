<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—needing the advisor yet suspecting complicity—remains embodied and specific; the final renunciation (“You were the weakness”) is earned because her escalating descriptions physically shatter the mirrors and dim the clasp. The only restraint from 9-band is that her prior-life biodata (childhood doorway, flatline) is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, so the hierarchy of fears feels listed rather than lived-in under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the mirrors crack, luminance bleeds out, and advisor shrinks—cost is visible and irreversible. Causal chain is clean: because Maren speaks the paradoxical definitions, the archive collapses; the lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity. One hairline slip: “address written in backward script across a mirror that no longer existed” is slightly fuzzy causality—how did she remember it?—but the beat is not pivotal enough to fracture the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The funhouse mirrors act as both setting and constraint: their warping dictates what Maren can/cannot see and ultimately fractures under her speech, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail—“luminance that clung,” “paper stubs yellowed into brittle wafers”—roots us without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is cleanly tracked through the crooked entrance, corridor, distortion panel. Micro-setting qualifier met: the clasp and mirrors directly shape tactics and payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing weakness”—is signaled early and tightened when Maren realizes the advisor feeds the archive. One meaningful turn: her choice to speak the definitions collapses the gallery and forecloses retreat. Cost is legible (advisor diminished, mirrors dark, blank book remains), though the price to Maren herself is more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping entry to low-8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: fear’s definitions can be rewritten, but only at the price of becoming the archivist of one’s own terror. The blank book’s final image reweights earlier paradoxes into an open future. No moralizing, only resonant ambiguity—she is free yet carrying the instrument of future inscription. Subtext in advisor’s smile—“repulsive and radiant”—carries the dual seduction/cruelty throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-compressed voice: “voice like silk drawn across a wound,” “archive of her terrors.” Syntax lengthens then fragments under pressure, mirroring mirror-buckling. Perceptual signature stays locked to Maren—no head-hopping. Advisor’s diction is antique yet consistent; Maren’s interior diction remains modern-poetic without slippage. Punctuation and grammar obey the gothic-lyric contract taught from line 1.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (atmosphere, backstory cue, emotional tilt). No synonym loops or template cadences; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (light as liquid, breath as excess). One clause flirts with overwriting: “simultaneously repulsive and magnetic” is abstract, but the next concrete image (“threading through the warped corridors”) grounds it. Closure beat is clean and uncluttered, allowing 9-band flirtation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—post-resuscitation quest + paradoxical dream-dictionary weapon—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The funhouse-as-feeding-archive flips standard haunt tropes into conceptual horror. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specificity anchors novelty: moth-shaped clasp, backward-script address. Not quite 9+ only because the childhood-doorway image leans on a universal trope without further particularization.</comment>
