<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven precision and the embodied ritual with the snow globe give us a lived-in interior; the final micro-choice—setting the globe down—earns its cost because the prior beats have tied the object to both daughter and Earhart’s laugh. The “quietly analytic” trait is more than label: it determines how she moves through the wreck and how she metabolizes the intercept. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only recollected, keeping this just outside the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the four-second “Laughter. Then silence” re-weights every prior thread and lets the snow-globe image settle into a new physics of letting go. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dive adds density until the pattern breaks with the laugh—and the cost is legible in the final sentence: “transmission received.” Causality remains intact; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken library is not mere backdrop; its waterlogged bindings, kelp-fused twine, and creaking hull constrain how Elara can extract the log and therefore when the revelation arrives. Micro-setting (the snow globe) charges the final image. A hairline slip: the patrol-vessel receiver is introduced only at the payoff, so the spatial anchor to that secondary node is thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to let go of a voice—tightens when the intercept proves the voice ended in laughter, not distress, forcing a recalibration of grief. The escalation is textural: each dive adds fragments until the laugh breaks the pattern. A crisper external obstacle (time, air, rival salvor) would have raised pressure another notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the convergence of archival precision and maternal grief: silence can be a completed sentence rather than an interruption. The snow globe’s reconfigured snow mirrors the laugh-silence inversion, giving a non-literal answer to the physics of release. No moralizing—just re-weighted meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lyric third-person stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature: salt-married ink, frequency-by-frequency untangling, the static-like snow. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her patience, then shortens at the laugh reveal. No head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors the dive-and-surface motion; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“salt and time had married ink to pulp” does double descriptive and emotional work. The final paragraph’s controlled repetition of “snow fell” is earned, not algorithmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Earhart intercept as a portal to private grief is fresh, and the laugh-into-silence reversal reframes a famous mystery without gimmick. Risk is present—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot thriller—but the voice and object work keep it from feeling like a stitched prompt response.</comment>
