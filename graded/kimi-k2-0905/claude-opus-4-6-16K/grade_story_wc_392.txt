<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nora’s complicity and turn are rendered through concrete micro-choices—photographing corrosion, capping the pen—so the final refusal feels earned. Interiority stays specific to her professional gaze; no diagnostic self-labels intrude. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “fortified herself not against fear but around it,” which momentarily softens embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: denied requisitions → lethal tunnel → lantern discovery → report rewrite; each beat tightens Nora’s options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—she seals the report she knows will trigger Bosch’s reprisal. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel water, copper stink, and corroded wiring are filtered through Nora’s forensic gaze, guiding her choices. The lantern’s soot-black glass physically occupies the final image, recharging the historical layer. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she kneels, photographs, climbs; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—professional complicity vs. moral accountability—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each new document proves the city’s guilt. The lantern beat deepens rather than widens stakes, tying past endangerment to present choice. Cost is palpable: career, pension, peace of mind all forfeit when she caps the pen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—institutional murder versus individual witness—emerges through requisition denials and the lantern’s silent indictment; no final moralizing required. Subtext lives in the missing screws: tiny absences that kill. The closing image reweights the lantern from artifact to torch, letting resonance glimmer without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Nora’s perceptual grammar—“headlamp cutting a clean line,” “copper smell” read as her sensory filters. Syntax lengthens under pressure then snaps short at the cap-pen moment, mirroring decision. No head-hopping; diction stays within her professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances motive (“green powder” indicts the city). No scaffold loops; metaphors are spare and physical. Only a trace of template cadence in the triple “the city knew” anaphora, but it serves rhetorical pressure rather than clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment> grafting Underground Railroad resonance onto municipal negligence feels fresh, not grafted; the lantern’s reappearance reconfigures both timelines. Risk is taken with the historical echo, yet it pays off by reframing Nora’s complicity. Premise could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
