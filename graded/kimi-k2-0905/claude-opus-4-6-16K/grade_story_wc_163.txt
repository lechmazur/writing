<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and exile-drive are vivid; Jonah’s insomnia-as-belonging mirrors hers. Both carry contradictions on the page (she charts belonging yet keeps leaving; he hides in slow coral time yet speaks). Micro-choices—aligning the astrolabe, leaving the feather—embody stakes. Closure cost (renouncing the talisman) is legible but feels slightly under-dramatized; feather exit reads more symbolic gesture than wrenching relinquish.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star-to-feather patterning, then comb-jelly incursion, tighten toward a Charged Poise. Every beat adds density rather than causal reversals, ending with a resonant reconfiguration of “belonging” that costs Maren her compass. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean; no teleporting props or logic drift. The feather drop is the visible price; without it the final pulse would feel un-earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cracked dome breathing with tide, bioluminescent algae ribbons, and polymer-sealed fracture give tactile stakes to each adjustment of the astrolabe. Environment actively filters perception: refracted star-light, kelp tea steam, shared breath fogging—each re-emphasizes containment and permeability. The burnt feather on the platform becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting supplies both resources (refraction data) and constraints (pressure, darkness) that shape the belonging quest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a rhythm that allows belonging—faces a single meaningful deepening when the comb jellies arrive; their ephemeral light makes continuing solitude feel costlier under Accumulative lens. Agency manifests in calibration acts and final gift of the feather; no external antagonist needed. Pressure tightens not through reversals but density and beauty, forcing a crystallized stance rather than a new tactic. Cost is visible (loss of talisman) yet could feel sharper on the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inverse relation between mapping and staying: navigation tools accumulate while anchors are voluntarily stripped. Comb-jelly “fireflies” reframing exile as shared summer is an earned conceptual reprice, not moralizing. Subtext of parental burning lingers in carbon-scar constellations without explication. Final image of a heart “remembering how to belong” resonates because earlier particulars (charts, feather, coral time) reconfigure around it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Maren, filtering every perception through astro-cartographic diction—“gravitational whispers,” “shadowseam”—maintaining perceptual signature. Rhythm varies: long tidal sentences interrupted by quick calibrations mimic her turns of the ring. Dialogue minimal but distinct; Jonah’s first line compresses wonder and scientific precision. No head-hop, consistent psychic distance; stylisation is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense yet purposeful, each metaphor advancing atmosphere or thematic refraction; only one near-muddle (“shadowseam, stitched between dark hollows”) but image resolves. Sentence variety excellent; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information load high without scaffolding (“biodomes still pressurized… corridors still lit…”). Clarity never buckles; final feather image lands clean. No artifacts intrude on closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of underwater star-mapping for emotional belonging feels fresh; synthesizes astrology, marine biology, and submerged architecture without gimmick. Risk of lyrical overpour is held in check by concrete tool manipulation and embodied stakes. Comb-jellies-as-fireflies twist reframes familiar trope into new emotional logic. Transformation test passes: plot depends on exact pressures of seawater refraction and tidal dome; swap setting and whole arc collapses.</comment>
