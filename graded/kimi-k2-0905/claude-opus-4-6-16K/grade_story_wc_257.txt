<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in jeweler’s micro-gestures; the shift from “hands that stopped” to cutting copper and clasping her own brooch shows contradictory impulses in-scene. The final self-commission costs her the illusion that she can craft grief for others without entering it herself—an earned renunciation. No stock grief labels; every emotional beat is filtered through metal, light, or dusk. Interiority stays strictly character-bound, no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: she descends wearing the first brooch she can’t sell, refracting hybrid star/sunlight—an undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: each origami coordinate layers a pattern of “dying-yet-becoming” that reweights the stake until she turns the lens on herself. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“granite ridge”), transitions legible. No causality breaks; the stencil, origami, and brooch form a coherent chain of artifacts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory’s perpetual dusk functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: no clocks, no night, forcing her to measure time by light through metal and glass. Copper sheet, cracked filter, and refractor dials are tactile tools that charge the final image when the brooch throws a constellation across her skin. Spatial choreography is exact—eyepiece housing, lens cap, railing—no floating props. Weatherless sky mirrors her stasis while star/sun hybrid light enables the closing reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she resume making mourning jewelry after her own loss—tightens when each celestial object shows death midwifing birth, forcing her to test the stencil on copper for herself. One meaningful deepening: she folds her own heart-coordinates and leaves them, foreclosing the observer role. Cost is visible in the wrist clasp that traps her own grief in metal she can’t commercialize. Agency is accumulative/textural but unmistakably hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light and “genuinely artificial” artifacts: mourning jewelry as honest fakery that still illuminates absence. Final image reweights the stencil motto—“teach withering to bloom again”—from slogan to embodied paradox: skeletal hand cradles blooming constellation-shadow. No overt thesis; resonance grows from particular copper cuts and filter glass. Ambiguity remains—she descends into an unnamed hour—yet cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains jeweler’s perceptual signature: noticing veins in petals, alloy possibilities, light through glass. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“She cut and filed”—then widens for cosmic vistas without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; syntax mirrors lapidary precision. Distinct diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no decorative astronomy jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances emotion and setting simultaneously. Varied rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors absent; “curtains of intention” is taught by the nebula image and paid off at closure. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph either changes emotional charge or physical option. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes mourning jewelry, origami star maps, and timeless observatory into an inevitable whole that feels newly minted. Risky perpetual-dusk premise is fully committed to and pays off in the hybrid light reconfiguration. “Genuinely artificial” concept reframed from postmodern cliché into lived grief practice. Could not swap copper stencil or cracked filter without collapsing the arc; transformation is complete.</comment>
