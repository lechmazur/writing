<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s pacifism is not a label but a lived method—she metabolizes strangers’ grief rather than inflicts harm, and the final weightlessness literalizes her earned lightness. The interior contradiction (wishing humanity extinct) is dramatized in one compressed beat with Kwan Yin’s Tear, so the renunciation carries cost. Micro-choices are scarce because no second character is on-stage to create status friction; the score tops just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seam opens not by force but by Maren’s integration of her own shadow, reweighting the premise that “pacifists cannot fight wars.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each grief-thread raises density until the Archive tears—held cleanly to the final image. Cost is legible in her literal weightlessness: she has traded anchoring sorrow for bodhisattvic buoyancy, a price that persists after the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Archive’s curved glass wall, tear shimmer, and cryopod in Bay 7 function as micro-setting: the photographs’ emotional residue is the only tool Maren can wield, and its properties dictate her tactics. Spatial choreography is tight—floating vs. planted feet track grief load in real time. Environment directly supplies the resource that charges the final image; no other setting could provide the same constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the Inward or humanity ends—is signaled in paragraph two. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Maren confronts her own annihilation wish; that shadow-integration forecloses the option to quit and triggers the dimensional tear. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the accumulation of absorbed grief unmistakably narrows her options until transcendence is the only remaining move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of warfare: the only battle a pacifist can win is internal shadow-assimilation. The final image of billions waiting beyond the seam reconfigures extinction into trans-dimensional continuation without moralizing. Subtext resides in the tear-protein mechanics—compassion literalized as technology—so the conceptual frame feels discovered rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Maren’s perceptual filter: scorch marks, stitched hulls, and gravitational mood shifts are noticed because they affect her body and mission. Syntax lengthens during absorption beats, then fragments at the tear—“light that was not light”—mirroring her cognitive breach. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is maintained through consistent imagistic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers grief, artifact, or bodily response without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (Archive as lung, tears as text) extend from the same biomechanical lexicon, avoiding mixed vehicles. One clause—“dense, total, compressive”—risks adjective stack but occurs inside a low-action beat, so momentum survives; no artifacts touch the closure line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of bodhisattva relic, emotional proteomics, and gravitational mood literalizes pacifist heroics in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk is high—trans-dimensional salvation via absorbed grief—but the piece commits fully, following its logic to the weightless final smile. Removing any core image (stitching, tear, photograph shimmer) collapses the mechanism; specificity makes the concept non-portable.</comment>
