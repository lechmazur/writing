<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. the terror of being the only one who sees the trap—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices: isolating the ghost harmonic, bribing the guard with empanadas, deciding to transmit back. The “cautiously hopeful” tag is shown, not told, in her steady night-work and final stoic acceptance of hatred. Status dynamics with Dean Vasquez remain off-page, but Maren’s embodied fatigue and coffee-stained fingers keep her physically present. The renunciation (she saves a world that will hate her) is earned and costly; the only slack is the slight abstractness of “cosmic tricksters” as interior label.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: anomaly → verification → gifts → division → Maren’s counter-signal → silence → hatred. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the sky’s emptiness is the price she pays for thwarting extinction-level dependency. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (university radio station, burnt coffee, charts). No teleporting props or retro-patches. The lens—Causal—holds without ambiguity; every beat tightens options until the final quiet image reweights the stakes.</comment>

<comment>The radio station’s analog board (tool) literally enables detection below 20 Hz, constraining discovery and the counter-attack. Charts re-appear as handled objects whose trembling margins externalize Maren’s pulse. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: subsonic vibrations “felt in the chest” mirror the intellectual chill. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean—broadcast desk, fluorescent lights, single guard—no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—species-scale survival—signals early via “end of the world” smell. Pressure escalates through because/therefore: each verified gift tightens institutional greed and shortens the fuse to ecological collapse. The decisive narrowing occurs when Maren’s mirror-signal collapses the ET channel, forcing humanity back to its own resources at the cost of her social exile. Cost is visible: “they hated her for it.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: generosity-as-enslavement, the price of识破 (seeing through) deception. Subtext lives in the ghost harmonic—what sounds like salvation hums a death-note beneath. Final image reweights the premise: empty sky is both relief and loneliness, a conceptual repricing of “hope.” No final-paragraph moralizing; the emotional after-effect is bitterness laced with endurance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren; no head-hop. Voice texture is scientist-poet: “ionized dust,” “elegant and simple” formula, “cascading into catastrophic feedback.” Syntax flexes under pressure—long clause-stacked sentences for intellectual urgency, then stark fragments at silence. No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay within POV lexicon. Dialogue is absent by design; narration carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: one sentence often does exposition + atmosphere + character (“She spread the astronomical charts… trembling under the fluorescent lights”). No scaffold, loops, or synonym churn. Metaphors are controlled (“wet paper” for formula collapse) and consistent with physics imagery. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line provides resonant cadence. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by academic POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “alien benevolence as slow-motion bioweapon” trope is refreshed by the subsonic ghost harmonic and the protagonist’s counter-mirror tactic. Specificity—20 Hz floor, coffee-stained charts, empanada bribe—prevents generic lift. Risk is taken: no alien reply, only silence, forcing humanity to confront itself. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; remove the radio station’s analog threshold and the story collapses.</comment>
