<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—yearning for the intersection while fearing arrival—remains embodied in thorn-scar palms and root-bound boots; the final step into convergence costs her eleven years of safety and every map she drew, a renunciation legibly paid. Micro-choices (trimming, pressing the key-sprig into her own flesh) tighten stakes; no diagnostic self-talk. The only drag is a hairline slide toward symbolic shorthand in “dreamer and the dream refused to remain separate,” but the body-map scars keep it credibly physical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the threshold opens, sky folds shut, and Sable’s future is foreclosed with a single step that reweights every prior covenant. Causality is intact—scar-map → key-sprig → threshold—under an Accumulative/Textural lens where pattern break (hedges outpacing schedule) escalates to final cadence shift. Orientation is taught by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is visible in the cobalt sky sealing behind her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s light-smell of “every dream she had ever catalogued” functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; the maze’s eastern corridors are tracked through scar-geometry, constraining her decoding act. Sensory selection stays urgent—electric hum, indigo dusk, warm boxwood—filtered through Sable’s gardener perception. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Meets 9+ gate: environment (scar-maze interface) shapes the decisive tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach or refuse the intersection—tightens once: hedges self-shape → Sable realizes covenant eclipsed → she implants key, forfeiting exit. Under Accumulative lens, density of dream-made-wood reweights cost; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: eleven years of rooted safety erased in the final step. Could edge higher if an intermediate tactical loss were dramatized on the page, but single deepening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: maps we make of ourselves become the cage and the key. Subtext lives in scar-tissue cartography and the unsettling elation of merging with one’s own unconscious archive. Final image reweights earlier sketches beneath the cot—her private imaginaries now literal and irreversible. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the folded-shut sky.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a gardener’s tactile lexicon—sprigs, root systems, groundwater—rhythming toward the luminous corridor without register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: Sable notices growth angles and soil warmth, not abstract dream theory. Compression in “sky folded shut like a book” is earned by earlier book-of-dreams motif. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens cleanly under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layer (“spirals that mimicked nerve endings”) is sparse and patterned early, avoiding purple overload. Strong verbs—sank, shuddered, folded—propel closure without scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long vegetative clauses to the staccato final step.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses horticulture with oneiric cartography in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen; topiary as skeleton key is a fresh morphic leap. Risky second-person imperative (“Heed the maze”) from vegetal chorus pays off by forcing Sable’s irreversible choice. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic portal fantasy—scar-map body logic is story-specific. Synthesis of gardener, prisoner, and cartographer into one consciousness is non-obvious and durable.</comment>
