<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lien’s “esoteric realist” label is dramatized through tactile knot-tying and the refusal to leave permanent traces; her contradictory impulses—archive vs. erasure—coexist in the same micro-gestures. The final renunciation (dismantling every tripod) is earned by the prior causal chain: build → attract → document → erase. Cost is visible in her frost-bitten fingers and the solitary moth wing she keeps, a concrete forfeiture that forecloses any future return. Interiority stays specific and embodied; no diagnostic self-talk intrudes.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photograph enters an archive, Dawa’s name is spoken into history, yet the grotto is left to vanish—an irreversible reconfiguration of visibility vs. impermanence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each temporary structure adds density until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“The grotto floated…”) and never loosens. Persistent constraint—altitude, cold, limited bamboo—shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<comment>The grotto’s condensation-slick stones and thin wind actively constrain knot-tying dexterity and dictate the transient materials; the same moisture will rot the bamboo within weeks, enforcing impermanence. Body-as-setting is felt in numb fingertips that must finish knots before circulation fails. The final image—the moth wing trembling inside the journal—recharges the earlier monarch scale and fuses setting, tool, and body into one charged object. No detail is tourism; every sensory note alters what is physically possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—record Dawa’s vanished cartography before the monarch route itself vanishes—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lien dismantles the very evidence she staged, trading physical presence for archival permanence. One meaningful deepening occurs at dusk: the butterflies arrive, land on the structures, and the live confirmation of Dawa’s map converts possibility into documented fact; options narrow to “photograph now or lose forever.” Cost is visible in the dismantling action and the solitary wing she keeps—an unambiguous forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history is a gesture of removal as much as inscription. Subtext resides in the knot language—tension/release as historiography—and in the final moth wing, which silently asks what survives when the archive itself is a portable shard. No character states the theme; resonance arrives through the interrupted cadence of structures built to fall. The ending reweights the premise: visibility is paid for with erasure, a non-literal answer that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lien’s perceptual filter—she notices condensation, cord bite, altitude sting—never ventriloquizing butterflies or future readers. Syntax lengthens during calm construction, then fractures into short clauses as fingers numb, mirroring physiological decay. No head-hopping; the one-line alpenglow paragraph is still filtered through her wrist-scale perspective. Diction remains within the lexicon of a field-scholar who ties knots rather than theorizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “orange wings catching the last horizontal light until the grotto seemed filled with floating embers” performs image, stakes, and temporal limit in one stroke. No scaffold sentences, no synonym loops; each paragraph advances either material constraint or archival stakes. Figurative language peaks only at the arrival beat, then thins as cold intensifies, a controlled cadence shift. The final line’s held-breath simile lands without prior metaphor clutter, sharpening resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—ephemeral land-art as historiography, monarch migration as ticking clock, vanished female cartographer recovered by another woman—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is taken in the quiet ending that withholds physical confrontation for archival poetics, yet coherence holds. No trope is stock: the “knot code” repurposes trail-marking into historiographic ethics, and impermanence is embraced rather than lamented. Transformation test fails if names or places change; the altitude, species, and gendered erasure are irreducibly specific.</comment>
