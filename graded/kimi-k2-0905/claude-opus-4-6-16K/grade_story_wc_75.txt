<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maret’s interiority is richly particular—thumb on lens, dread as rosewater mist—and her historian’s precision underpins every micro-choice. The shift from private grief to communal ritual is credibly staged, with the starchy-tuber workaround showing embodied ingenuity. Yet the absence of any secondary character applying live pressure keeps the arc essentially monologue; the “thaw” is more observed than interactionally tested. Still, the renunciation of rye for gray dough carries a felt cost that earns the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mineral accretion mirrored in cultural deposit. Closure—Charged Poise: the waterfall’s roar is re-weighted as cradle, not coffin, with the cost of permanent exile still audible. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The single beat of baking initials tightens stakes by making abstraction edible; no causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics, silver water-columns, limestone narrowing like arteries—every sensory pick is filtered through Maret’s curator gaze. The opera-glass lens functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when its green ghost-light dances over gray bread. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies orbit the coal-flat stones without drift. Environment literally shapes tactics: no rye → tuber → bread → memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent identity erosion via art of bread. Escalation is textural—flour running out, custom freezing, then tuber discovery re-weights possibility. The single tightening beat (forming the first gray initial) forecloses surrender to abstraction; price is the taste of earth instead of honey. Agency lies in curation under constraint, not victory over oppressor—appropriate to lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “the fossil of hope is eaten, not displayed.” Subtext operates in silence: children chewing initials wordlessly inherit memory. No moralizing; final answer is an image—green light on gray bread—re-pricing exile as continuance. Rosewater dread thins but never vanishes; ambiguity between endurance and renewal is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight inside Maret’s perceptual filter: opera glass = “velvet balcony,” tuber = “gray dense nothing like rye.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during grinding/baking—rhythm mirrors cognitive load. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within curator lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<comment>Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphor density is high yet purposeful—“luminous drowning glow,” “mineral deposits thickened like grief”—all serve curator’s gaze. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Read-aloud rhythm swells to waterfall白噪声, then fractures into the cracked initial—cadence mirrors content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Displacement-through-bread is a fresh inflection on cultural erasure; lens-as-projector turns exile into makeshift proscenium. Risk is taken in quiet accretive structure rather than confrontation, yet coherence holds. Specificity of Kashari initial-bread lore prevents swap with generic refugee tale. Transformation test fails only if lens, tuber, waterfall removed—proving integration.</comment>
