<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“cells of her wrists… behind her knees”) and resentment is load-bearing. The renunciation beat is earned—she presses the pin, almost bleeds, then sets it down open-handed—so the cost is visible. Could use one more live contradiction in-scene to reach 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence→music-box→cellular playback→open-hand reprise tightens the pattern. CR closure lands—“the silence she carried finally shaped like a door”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; transitions are legible shards within the 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the absence of vibration forces bodily listening. Brass pin, granite floor, and re-emerging market noise are tactile anchors. Final reprise of sound charging her bones crystallizes the image under the CR lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release resentment or fortify identity—tightens once when she risks the broken pin. The escalation is a single deepening rather than causal chain, appropriate to Accumulative lens. Visible price: she forfeits the structural anger that once defined her, shown by open-hand set-down.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “shifting grace” emerges through the missing note adapting rather than being restored. Subtext is carried in gesture and object, never stated as thesis. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing, meeting CR standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains perceptual signature—cobblestones “dissolve,” cells “remember.” Prose modulates from lyric density to spare final sentence, mirroring emotional release. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats—“Not in her ears. In her body.”—and no scaffold loops. Figurative language is selective, never floods a beat. Line-level propulsion carries to the final clause without artifact interference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar grief-arc is refreshed by soundless sanctuary physics and cellular-memory delivery system. Broken-pin motif transforms absence into adaptive grace, a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk in form is moderate but successful under 800-word CR closure.</comment>
