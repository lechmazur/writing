<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured and embodied—copper veins, diamond pulse, canyon echoes—making her drive to “translate texture into sound” visceral. The final micro-choice to speak the untranslatable word is credibly foreshadowed and costs her the last breath of the language she serves. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon itself becomes the final speaker, crystallizing the old tongue inside its walls with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (copper, diamond, flock glyph) tightens the density until the single syllable reweights the world. Orientation is clear by line 30; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The bone canyon is not backdrop; its echo physics supplies the ultimate archive that makes Maren’s sacrifice irreversible. Micro-setting (the fractured diamond pressed to copper veins) literally channels her final choice, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the tower, flock, and fracture all track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“last speaker” literal extinction—are signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates by accretion: each lost elder, each copper silence, each clouded facet tightens the noose until only the untranslatable word remains. The price (language leaves the throat forever) is legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: transmission exceeds mortality, brokenness can be sung into permanence. The diamond’s shift from “cursed” to “luminous” reweights the motif of fracture as necessary aperture, not flaw. No moralizing; the canyon’s echo offers a charged poise that invites multiple readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s synesthetic threshold—syntax lengthens when she listens to bone, clips when she decides. Diction stays within her perceptual lexicon (“granular roughness where clarity meets its own flaw”) without purple drift. No dialogue; voice coherence remains pristine under final pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment> Rhythm breathes with the flock wheel overhead; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“towers of bone rose like pale fingers”) and pays off in the luminous fracture, so earns its weight. One paraphrase hiccup—“brightness interrupted…the roughness where clarity meets its own flaw”—is forgiven because the second phrasing specifies the sound she must craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—“last speaker gives language to stone”—is ancient, yet the execution fuses metallurgic body modification, avian linguistics, and echo-archaeology into an inevitable synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple fog; instead it crystallizes into a closure image that feels newly discovered. No trace of template or trope recycling.</comment>
