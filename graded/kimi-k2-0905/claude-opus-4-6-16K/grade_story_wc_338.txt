<comment>Maren’s “methodically curious” tag is shown more than told—she realigns a single map border for three hours—but the only on-page choice is to notice the under-drawing. That moment of attention crystallizes her stance, yet the cost is intellectual, not visceral; we don’t feel her career or identity bruised. Interiority stays consistent and embodied (“steps dissolve into nothing”), but the final beat lacks a palpable forfeiture. Still, the contradiction between maps-as-control and rain-as-erasure is hers alone, so motivation holds.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “scream painted over” reweights every prior map she has framed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—rain’s slow erasure builds across beats until the under-drawing reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting. One tightening only, but it is decisive: the serene face becomes a cry. Cost is legible in the final image; no因果 break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The vault, rain, and henge stones are tactile and selective—water “worked the painted plaster the way grief works a face.” Acoustic rule (whispers swallowed) constrains Maren’s decision to stay silent at the end. Spatial choreography is clean; body, laptop, and pillars track. The micro-setting of the “tear in the map” at the woman’s throat charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will Maren record only loss or also reveal the silenced cry? Pressure escalates via accumulative erosion—each fresco panel shows more pigment gone—until the under-drawing forces her to redraw her own map of responsibility. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening at the woman’s throat. Cost is conceptual (she must now carry the scream) rather than tactical; still legible on-page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: archival objectivity vs. empathic witness. The shift from “here is where the world holds” to “here is where it breaks” is never stated as thesis; it is enacted by the revealed mouth. Subtext lives in silence—chapel acoustics, mute video, painted-over cry—so the final whispered exit resonates without moralizing. Complexity remains: preservation can equal silencing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s cartographer gaze—she notices borders, seams, pigment migration. Syntax mirrors her precision: “she watched…she paused…she saved.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses elegantly under pressure. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated. The final sentence’s cadence—“shielded and open in equal measure”—earns its lift without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; long sentence on grief mirrors slow decay, then clipped beats at climax. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances story or atmosphere. Mixed metaphor check: rain-as-grief and map-as-face stay coherent because both serve erosion. Information density high—e.g., “henge stones still bore cup-and-ring marks” does world, history, and boundary work in one line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresco-restoration-as-forensic-cartography feels fresh; the metaphoric leap from frame shop to chapel vault is specific and earned. No trope regurgitation; the “whispered chapel” could have been Gothic kitsch but is grounded in acoustic physics. Risk: silent video comparison as plot engine, yet it is internalized through Maren’s perceptual lens. Transformation test fails—only this protagonist would literalize disappearance as cartography—so novelty holds.</comment>
