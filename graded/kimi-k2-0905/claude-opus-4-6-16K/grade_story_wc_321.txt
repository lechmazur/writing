<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s stubborn “show-up” ethic is embodied in diesel-scented rags and micro-gestures; the final choice to braid timelines is the natural apex of that trait, paid for by her solitary vigil and the glowing hourglass she now carries. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One Mara among dozens still feels singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: vanished runs → lone Mara → retrieval of empty hourglass → radio sync → braid → restored schedule. The 11-minute gap closed by chronometer at the end is the visible cost that locks the Decisive Change. Mosaic shards (dock, grotto, radio chorus) are taught by 25 % and converge in one charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor salt, diesel, quartz ledge, and fractal star-whorls are filtered through Mara’s deckhand gaze; every sensory pick guides action—wiping cleats, stepping onto quartz, aiming radio at spirals. The hourglass’s glow charging her locker in the final line re-weights the entire crossing. Environment constrains and finally adorns the victory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the ferry existing”—tightens each time a run vanishes; Mara’s lone endurance escalates the cost until the radio-sync forces a final trade-off: personal isolation for communal continuity. Pressure is coherent, no reversals needed. Price is visible in the glowing hourglass she alone must guard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of steadfast presence emerges from diesel rags and blank logbooks, never sermonized. Final image—glowing hourglass in a worker’s locker—re-prices the ordinary commute as miracle. Ambiguity lingers: who poured the sand out, and will it empty again? Complexity respected, no moral nailed on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “boots left no echo,” “hum in her sternum.” Syntax coils like rope under stress, then flattens to workaday cadence back at dock. No head-hop among radio Maras; their layered voices function as choral setting, not POV breach.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous: “stars burned in constellations… small whorls nesting inside larger whorls” compresses infinite scale without purple drift. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing sentences mirror ferry schedule, giving the piece a metronomic spine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vanishing-ferry trope is refreshed by treating the commuter line as a living braid needing hourly maintenance; the empty hourglass as tool rather than symbol feels novel. Risky grotto descent pays off by re-centering on union labor ethos. Specificity of diesel, cleats, and VHF channels anchors the fantastical in working-class reality.</comment>
