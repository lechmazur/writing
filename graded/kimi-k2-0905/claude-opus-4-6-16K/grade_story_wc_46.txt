<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to her mother’s legacy while fearing the burn of ambition—surface in the tactile micro-choice of polishing the glass instead of a lens; the final decision to mount the glass in the telescope is earned by this quiet ritual and carries visible cost (she renounces personal custody to become a public conduit). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that no second character appears, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A and cannot elevate further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass moves from private relic to shared lens—an irreversible crystallization that reweights the premise “share light without fire.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each polishing orbit thickens memory-density until the final image releases the accumulated charge. Cost is legible in the phrase “she renounces personal custody,” felt in the pocket now empty. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine walls and mist function as micro-setting: their amber ribbons dictate the only safe workspace and supply the final projection surface that proves the glass can transmit cool light. Sea glass and grotto together constrain every action; without them the climax cannot occur. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—astronomer notices refraction indices, not tourist scenery. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tightens through the polishing beat: each circular stroke forecloses the option to keep the glass private. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the grotto walls bloom with pale color, confirming the glass can mediate starlight without heat; this narrows her future to public gift. Cost is visible in the relinquishing tuck into telescope housing. Agency remains internal yet decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of cool illumination: gentleness as transmissive strength. No explicit thesis; the final image of “quiet, generous light” reweights all prior fire/ash imagery without moralizing. Subtext resides in the polishing motion—an act of erosive love that removes material to reveal clarity. Complexity is honored: the mother’s absence stays irreparable, the gift nonetheless given.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomer-precise—“mineral veins of jade and iron,” “cerium oxide”—without academic intrusion. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory, staccato prepositional phrases under lantern light. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs appear only when motivated by reflective distance. Distinctive without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, memory, or choice. Figurative layer is spare—one sleeping-god mist, one pearl of stillness—paid off in the final projection. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by image. No register drift, no synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the polishing strokes. High information density: damp cloth, leather strop, aurora shard all serve double duty as memory and tool.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: telescope-making craft repurposed as grief ritual, starlight re-conceptualized as ocean-smoothed glass. The grotto-as-camera-obscura turn feels inevitable yet unanticipated. Risk lies in quietude—no antagonist, no fire—but coherence holds. Could swap names yet the craft detail is irreplaceable; specificity rescues from template.</comment>
