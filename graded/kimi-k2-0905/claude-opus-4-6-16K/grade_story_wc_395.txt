<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s “felt texture of data” and thumbnail-speed sensitivity give her a vivid sensory lens; the moment she copies the evidence and presses send crystallizes her arc with cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat could use one contradictory impulse (fear of retaliation? guilt over breaching loyalty?) to earn the 8-band. Motivation is legible throughout, yet the missing-persons stakes feel slightly abstract until the final paragraph, softening the pressure she personally risks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern of 7-22 sightings builds density until the unsent messages reweight the premise. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—”forty-three ghosts had drawn breath” makes the social cost undeniable. Orientation is clean by line 5; no causality breaks; the single transition into the hidden partition is legible. No persistent constraint shapes later tactics—Lena exits unscathed—so 9+ gate stays locked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archive as micro-setting hums, smells, and resists erasure; server-rack temperatures and orphaned partitions anchor every choice. Selective detail—“furniture in an abandoned house”—mirrors Lena’s caretaker empathy. The Chicago HQ remains a placeholder; no body or tool constrains the final action, so 9-band capped. Sensory hierarchy matches her data-attuned POV without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why 43 missing users are buried—signals early and tightens when Desmond lies. One meaningful deepening: the unsent messages reveal Site 722; options narrow from curiosity to whistle-blowing. Cost is conceptual (ghosts breathing) rather than felt by Lena; no loss of job, safety, or relationship alters tactics. Escalation is textural, not causal; pressure accumulates but never threatens the protagonist directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motif: data refuses oblivion; silence pulses louder than deletion. Final image reweights prior 7-22 countdown as heartbeat, not code—Conceptual Repricing avoids moralizing. Subtext in Desmond’s hand-twitch and dilated pupils carries menace without exposition. Ambiguity lingers: corporation still stands, ghosts merely breathe—complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“songs she could almost remember but never quite name”—sustains lyric cadence. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within data-curator lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Compression in “the silence inside it had changed” is purposeful, paid off by final breath image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; “buffer zone between active storage and permanent erasure” is efficient, double-duty. Rhythm varies with sentence length; no algorithmic drumbeat. One mixed metaphor—“last breath caught in glass” beside “heartbeat in the grave”—slight muddle under pressure. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: social-media ghosts counted in corporate metadata, not supernatural horror. Artemis-7 patch links aerospace failure to social-media burial—unexpected synthesis. Risk is conceptual, not structural; execution steady but not formally daring. Transformation test succeeds: swap archive for warehouse, premise collapses—specificity earned.</comment>
