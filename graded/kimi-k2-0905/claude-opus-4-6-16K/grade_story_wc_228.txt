<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic clinging vs. irreversible departure—are dramatized in the mirrored seashell placed against M. Trevarrow’s wall; the renunciation of the shell on the ledge costs her the safety of memory and lands as earned stasis. Interiority stays painter-specific, never drifting into diagnostic gloss. The only limit keeping this from 9+ is that the grandmother remains off-page, so status/relationship pressure is inferred rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the finished cave painting and abandoned shell crystallize that impermanence is the price of agency. The accumulative lens holds—each bioluminescent chamber adds density until the final reweighting. Causality is sound: the cracked mirror triggers the walk, the wrong turn delivers the cave, the shell’s placement externalizes promise kept. Cost is visible in the relinquished shell and the knowledge the tide will erase her work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shale grooves, breathing salt air, and tide-whisper give the cave body; the single blade of daylight that touches the wall daily literally constrains where she can paint, charging the final image. Coastal details emerge through painterly perception, not tourist list. Spatial choreography is immaculate—shoulder-width narrows to vaulting chambers and back to ledge. Micro-setting (the scallop shell) functions as both tool and signature, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the unspoken promise to paint from life—tightens when the cave gallery proves the attempt is mortal. The decisive escalation is the choice to add her own soluble quay scene, accepting erasure as the entry fee. Pressure stays accumulative: each dissolving grandmother painting foretells her fate, deepening cost without external antagonist. One meaningful turn suffices and is present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “temporary eternity” emerges through salt-blurred pigments and the final relinquished shell, never stated outright. The echo between granddaughter’s and grandmother’s harbors reconfigures legacy as participatory decay, not preservation. Subtext in the intimately aloof stance—she paints but never asks names—finds resolution in offering the painting to strangers who will never know her. Final image of breathing tide reweights impermanence as collaborative authorship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at the edge of free indirect, filtering cave perception through a painter’s chromatic lexicon (“cerulean over slate,” “violet derived from crushed sea urchin”). Rhythm modulates: held-breath fragments mirror the mirror crack, longer cadences echo tidal sighs. No dialogue present; therefore bullets on speech register waived. Distinct perceptual signature and controlled elision satisfy 9- gate; a single clause (“intimately aloof gaze”) skirts label-speak but is immediately embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: layered pigments/linseed oil packed into one sentence advance both atmosphere and packing action. Metaphors stay sensory and coherent—“cathedral” vault aligns with devotional tone. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Minor elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by context; register remains within painter-thinker range. Final third clean, allowing high-band retention.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar “return-to-sea-after-loss” arc is refreshed by soluble cave gallery and the shell-as-contract device. Wrong-turn-into-hidden-art trope is inverted: discovery completes, not rescues, the protagonist. Specific pigment lore and tidal erasure science ground the concept in lived craft. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative, satisfying risk bonus criteria.</comment>
