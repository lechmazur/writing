<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—yearning for pattern yet choosing exile—are dramatized in the jump; the oak-table beat embodies her sensibility, but “featherly determined” is asserted, not embodied. Interiority is specific until the final paragraph drifts toward abstraction. Closure carries clear cost: she forfeits the safety of the terrace, earning the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each refracted image and timber grain adds density until the threshold question crystallizes in the jump. Closure is a Charged Poise—ground rush reweights every prior distance. Orientation is swift; causality remains associative, not broken. Cost is legible in the leap itself, no safety net named.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism terrace, oak grain, and cracked Nebraska road are tactile and selective; terrace light constrains timing of the jump. Micro-setting (logbook margins, tree rings) charges the final image. Weather-migratory world is learned by refraction and buckled corn rows, never dumped. Spatial choreography holds as altitude lowers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens once when logbook phrase redefines “necessary distance,” then again when she stakes her body on the answer. Escalation is textural: each pattern (rings, codes, light) adds urgency until jump is the only remaining test. Cost is the fall itself; options narrow to earth or air.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through juxtaposition of maze exile and sacred threshold; no moral spoken. Final image answers the question non-literally—sacredness is the space that lets two states recognize each other. Subtext in pilot’s “unknown distance” mirrors Maren’s own. Complexity lingers: she seeks pattern yet leaps away from the perfect one she’s found.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s perceptual depth—wood grain read like Braille, light split into feathered arcs—without head-hop. Rhythm swells with lyric compression, taught by first refraction and paid off in jump. Diction stays within her earthy lexicon until “sacred” is earned. No dialogue to contaminate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, dual-duty; only “featherly determined” feels forced. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors (prismatic arcs, threshold species) cohere without crowding. Read-aloud rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences contract into “and jumped.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-climate-migration world is familiar, but linking monarch chaos to drifting glass terrace and corn-maze lineage feels fresh. Grain-reading as climatological communion is specific to this voice. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: jump reconfigures every prior image. Synthesis makes later beats feel inevitable.</comment>
