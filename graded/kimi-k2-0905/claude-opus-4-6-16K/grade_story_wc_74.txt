<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s eleven-day insomnia is vivid in her body and in the greenhouse dirt under her nails; every brush-stroke is a micro-choice that costs her stamina and brings the lost language up through her hand. The contradiction between cataloging scholar and possessed medium is alive in-scene, not abstract. The final surrender to sleep lands as earned renunciation: she forfeits control of the mystery she has chased, letting the “shy animal” of rest approach. Only the Chengdu memory arrives as told anecdote rather than dramatized beat, muting the cost of that link.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena lies down among wet canvases, foreclosing further decoding, while the moonlit brush—now recognized as conduit of shared kindness—rests beside her logbook. Causality holds: each night’s painting is driven by the earlier estate-sale gift, itself traced to her past good deed; the final sleep is allowed because she has answered the urge to reciprocate memory. The single shard structure keeps time and space legible; no orientation debt accrues. One minor elasticity: the forum post translation arrives as pure exposition, but it does not resolve the conflict, only tightens the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is rendered through Lena’s knees on cracked tile, tomato scent, and smog bruising the skyline—details that filter her lung-level exhaustion. The moon’s blade of gold and the shimmer of the calligraphy tip steer her altered attention, constraining when she slips into daydreams and when she surfaces. Spatial logic stays clean: six stories up, glass panes, slanted columns of light, nowhere to hide from the glow that triggers visions. City externals stay sketchy, but the micro-setting of body-plus-brush is what charges the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the pattern reveal a living language?”—tightens when the Chengdu photographs prove the symbols propagate through strangers, narrowing Lena’s solitude but raising existential cost: she might be a relay, not an author. Escalation is textural: each moonlit canvas adds sedimentary weight until the final vision of Deshi weeping tips her from pursuit to surrender. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the insomnia itself and the accumulating evidence of an unpaid debt of kindness. The price paid—eleven days of wakefulness and the forfeiture of further decoding—reads on the final page as she lies down among wet paint and pollen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kindness as pre-verbal grammar emerges through concrete recurrence: carrying canvases in Chengdu rain → brush inheritance → shared symbols → final message sent back to Deshi. No character moralizes; the theme accrues like pigment layers. The closing “saffron quiet” reconfigures loneliness into continuity without a thesis statement. Only a hairline slip: the abstract declaration “lost languages do not vanish” risks overt thesis, but it is immediately anchored to Lena’s cataloguing hand, so the resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person stays latched to Lena’s perceptual filter: tomatoes “listening,” moonlight as “blade,” exhaustion as sediment—no POV leakage. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her circadian drift; long alliterative stretches simulate trance, then fracture into short gasps when she surfaces. The estate-sale box and forum post are relayed through her interpretive gaze, keeping psychic distance consistent. Distinctive rhythmic signature is maintained without mannered overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: compound clauses slide into fragmentary percussions that mimic breath loss. Figurative language is dense but patterned—moon as blade, smog as bruise—taught early and reprised at closure without muddling causality. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; every sentence either advances paint stroke, body decay, or symbol discovery. One mixed metaphor (“waxing moon cut through…with a blade of pale gold”) is momentary but does not obscure the pivotal image of surrender.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Moon-driven lost-language trope is refreshed via insomnia-biology and stranger-kindness circuitry rather than mystic artifact cliché. The brush’s inheritance through an anonymous good deed converts standard magical instrument into social glue. Risk of sentimental “we are all connected” is averted by the unslept, pollen-stained cost on the final page. Specificity of Chengdu street rain and estate-sale box makes the premise feel one-of-a-kind rather than template-twist.</comment>
