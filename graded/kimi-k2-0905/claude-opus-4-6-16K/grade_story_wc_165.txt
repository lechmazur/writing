<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—precision versus wonder—remains embodied throughout; the bishop’s diagonal groove pressed into her palm while she times starlight shows her micro-choice hierarchy. The closure “earned stasis” is credible: she forecloses rest by planning tomorrow, a visible cost paid in fatigue and perpetual vigilance. Minor slip: her emotional degradation under stress is asserted (“lightly attentive”) rather than dramatized in a fumble or tremor, keeping her just shy of 9-band vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the applause fades, tide retreats, and Maren already counts again—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights repetition itself. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; each patterned return of tide, star, and bishop tightens the stakes of routine versus wonder. One hairline slip: the phrase “this was why Maren performed” momentarily explains rather than images the epiphany, a –0.1 nudge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The roofless arcade, ankle-deep mirrored constellations, and salt-slick mosaics directly constrain her barefoot timing and volunteer placement; environment is inseparable from choreography. Micro-setting triumph: the bishop’s worn groove functions as portable architecture that dictates diagonal possibility. Only the vendor’s almonds feel ornamental, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating monotony without drowning in its opposite—tightens when each “accidental” miracle is revealed as meticulous labor, deepening the cost of perpetual vigilance. The single escalation beat (Sirius flash/tide ring/bishop catch) crystallizes options: she can never stop calculating. Cost is legible but not viscerally felt; we see her sit to plan, not her blistered feet or stifled yawn, capping entry to 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: repetition transmuted into beauty through obsessive attention. The bishop’s diagonal, starlight’s cold blaze, and retreating tide recur with shifting weight, culminating in the final image of stars “turning on their ancient axes” while Maren turns her own—an indifferent universe answered by human pattern-making. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, slightly elevated diction (“slow-burning paintings,” “calculated wilderness”) that matches Maren’s precision without drifting into purple. Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences flow, then short pin-toss beats mimic arcs. Zero POV leakage; perception stays filtered through her cartographer gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is excellent; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (stars as gallery, bishop as philosophy) and physically aligned. One overripe phrase—“garden of chaos that bloomed on schedule”—slips toward mixed metaphor, a –0.1 ding, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of “orchestrated serendipity” within a tide-flooded arcade feels fresh, yet grows from recognizable street-performance and chess tropes. Specificity of star charts, tide tables, and diagonal bishop elevates it beyond gimmick. Risk is moderate; the concept is fully inhabited but not structurally daring enough for 9-band distinction.</comment>
