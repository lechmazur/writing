<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—gifted hearing now a torment—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of “finished” music is earned through layered sensory cost (ash-dampened violin, water at shins). One hairline slip: “unbearable” is diagnostic shorthand mid-crest; still, body and bow trade-offs feel lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught by ~100 words: rising tide, rotting apples, salt-fogged glass increase pattern density until the final image reweights silence itself as “rest between notes.” Closure is a Charged Poise; cost (unfinished tradition, perpetual return) crystallizes on the last copper-lit line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse-trawl micro-setting constrains every move: water depth dictates bow placement, hull hum supplies basso continuo, cracked pane buzzes back. Final image—“congregation of wrecks waiting”—recharges entire acoustic ecology; no other place could host this ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore acoustic reciprocity; tightening occurs when Maren cedes compositional control to ambient hulls/tide, trading resolution for ongoing dialogue. Cost is perpetual incompletion; price is felt but could be sharper—one more overt forfeiture (bow left in bowl) would clinch 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: unfinished = living; orchard, song, and shoreline all refuse closure yet keep generating. Subtext in gesture (bow across clay bowl) avoids sermon; final copper light re-prices silence as fertile, not dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—“sub-harmonic moan,” “deep green rustling”—is consistent, rhythmic, and biased to acoustic strata. Free indirect slips cleanly; no head-hop. Final hummed fragment from harbor keeps idiom modest, voice intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with tide; no scaffold loops. Mixed metaphors (“gray snow,” “bones of sleeping giants”) are earned by POV’s synaesthetic ear. High information density—“apples floated near her knees, half-rotten, half-sweet” does three jobs in nine words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-fire drowned orchard + violin duet with shipwrecks is a fresh synthesis; “magnificent simplicity” of someone humming across harbor re-weights entire acoustic grief. Risk of lyric refusal to resolve pays off; pattern taught early and held.</comment>
