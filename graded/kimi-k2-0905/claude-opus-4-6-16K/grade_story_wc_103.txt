<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to map time while surrendering to its erasure—is dramatized through barefoot texture and grafting cuts; the renunciation of the last photograph carries visible cost, cementing earned stasis. Yet the职业 detail of “hedge-maze designer” never perturbs a present choice, keeping motivation elegant but under-leveraged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photograph dissolves into white dust, paying the conceptual price of erasure while hyperbolic-root curvature reweights all prior imagery. Causal chain holds—fragment-touch → flood of past → geometry graft → voluntary disintegration—without teleport or soft reset; lens stays Accumulative/Textural to the final spectral refraction.</comment>

<comment>Living root-wood operates as both environment and tool: its lattice steers her grafting choices, while the gorge’s depth externalizes time’s drop. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—bark against soles, dust taste, spectral light—compressing exposition into tactile beats; the final root-post anchoring the dissolving photograph fuses setting and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she can steer retrocognitive overload into chosen navigation—tightens once via the hyperbolic-graft decision, narrowing options from drowning to directed stepping. Cost is legible: she forfeits photographic proof and surrenders to root-time, but escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal compounds pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-fibrous-not-smooth emerges from root choreography and photograph effacement, never declared. The conceptual repricing—image returning to its originating light—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is disappearance liberation or annihilation, weighted by prior material.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: ficus “thick as a man’s torso,” “time split open like a fig,” diction botanical and tactile. Rhythm modulates—long horticultural cadences contract to short spectral bursts—mirroring her oscillation between surrender and control; no head-hopping or register drift under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers botanic term, sensory bite, and temporal metaphor without scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“time split open like a fig… fibrous and branching”) stay coherent under root logic; no loops, filter stacks, or therapy labels. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively”) is justified by designer-intellectual POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of hyperbolic-maze geometry with living-root time travel feels non-obvious yet inevitable; hedge-maze past as primer for temporal navigation is fresh inflection. Risk in lyric erosion of photograph pays off by reweighting premise. Without this precise geometry conceit, the visionary closure collapses.</comment>
