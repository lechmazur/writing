<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s shift from needing a “simple tyrant” to accepting braided truth is embodied in the ampoule hand-off; the queen-statue’s “incisively kind” precision gives her a telegraphed hierarchy of values. One dangling point: we never see Maren’s interior resistance in real time—her “I’ll tell it true” arrives as declared verdict rather than dramatized surrender, so the cost is felt more by concept than by body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the ampoule’s meaning flips from genocide evidence to “evidence of care,” re-weighting the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—each telepathic revelation tightens Maren’s options until she must choose which story to surface—and the persistent constraint (she still has to sell nuance to a certainty-hungry world) shapes tactics beyond the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garden’s bioluminescent trellises and kelp-canopy are filtered through Maren’s mission-oriented gaze, constraining movement and supplying the telepathic interface; the foxglove-stained ampoule itself functions as micro-setting that finally re-calibrates meaning. Spatial anchors are immediate—“pedestal of basalt laced with barnacles” grounds the pivot—so environment actively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“confirm genocide vs. accept moral tangle”—is signaled by line 6 and tightened once: the statue’s cascade forces Maren to relinquish the “clear moral” she came for. Cost is legible (her reputation, funding, political safety all jeopardized by nuance), though escalation is a single deep turn rather than mounting external threats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: medicine/poison duality braided with cultural amnesia, crystallized when the ampoule is laid at the statue’s feet as offering rather than exhibit. Final image—stone arms finally offering “to a visitor who had arrived”—delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Only hairline slip: “the truth holds all of it” skirts platitude, but context re-weights it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush yet controlled lyric third-person hovers just above Maren’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors pressure-changes, marine light, pharmacological residue. Syntax modulates—long breathing cadence in garden description, clipped fragments during revelation flood—without register drift. Telepathic italics cleanly differentiate voice layers; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences pull double duty (world-building + interior tilt) with natural rhythm; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative density peaks during the cascade but stays pattern-taught—foxglove “threaded through structural weakness” mirrors city/queen transformation—so propulsion is intact. Zero typos or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sunken garden + telepathic statue + pharmacological misreading synthesizes into fresh angle on “history is a poison/medicine” trope; the city that chooses slow drowning rather than invasion feels non-obvious. Transformation test fails if you swap elements—foxglove residue and stone-consciousness are irreplaceable to the turn. Risk-taking (telepathy without explanation, consensus suicide) heightens coherence rather than gimmick.</comment>
