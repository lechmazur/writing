<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vael's lineage duty and tactile expertise are vivid; her decisive crawl to the smooth ice and choice to "conjure" the hush feel earned. Interiority stays concrete ("teeth ache," "fingers reading"). Cost is visible: lifelong maps are fracturing, her body bruised by sound. No contradictory impulses in scene; still, the renunciation is gentle—more acceptance than wrenching sacrifice, so the emotional ceiling stops just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the projected hush reweights the caves’ resonance and the beings’ glow, with ripple-marks recording a “slow negotiation of coexistence.” Causal chain is intact: read cracks → locate node → capture pattern → project calm; each step narrows options. Cost is legible on-page—“fresh language the caves were learning to speak” carries irreversible change. Lens (Causal) holds cleanly; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz seams as “rivers of pale fire,” ice fracture lexicon, and ripple-mark grammars give tactile specificity. Micro-setting (ice sheet) directly enables the climax; environment constrains posture and discovery. Sensory hierarchy honors Vael’s mapkeeper priorities. While grand cave geography is sketched more than mapped, the immediate sensorium is irreplaceable and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the archive of vibration—faces a single, sharp tightening when she locates the uncracked ice and decides to trap its cancellation pattern. Escalation is coherent: sound pressure rises from “hammered repose” to “unbearable,” then eases after her conjuring. Price is palpable: ancient marks blur forever; her body absorbs bell-forge blows. One beat, but it forecloses the old harmonic order, satisfying the length’s demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: archives are not preserved by stasis but by active listening and adaptive translation. The hush is neither victory nor defeat—an earned equilibrium coded into fresh ripple grammar. No moral abstracted; resonance rests in the final “trembling line.” Subtext in energy beings’ dimmed reverence adds cosmic humility without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Vael’s sensorium: vibration read through touch, sight tuned to interference patterns. Syntax lengthens under sonic assault, then trims at the moment of capture, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Distinct lexicon of acoustics and cartography stays believable for the lineage. Minor echo of “gently luminous” but within pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: clause length modulates with cave resonance; sentences do double duty (action + sonic texture). One weak cadence run: “each blow a settling, each echo a bruise” leans on template anaphora, but it pays off by foreshadowing pattern capture. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clumps. Clean grammar; punctuation supports breath control. High density without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acoustic archaeology as survival craft feels fresh; using fracture patterns in ice as real-time spectral readout is specific and memorable. Energy beings stay unexplained, avoiding tired invasion tropes—function more as catalysts for a curator’s metamorphosis. Central synthesis (vibration cartography + interference quiet zone) is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in lyric escalation rewarded; no derivative aftertaste.</comment>
