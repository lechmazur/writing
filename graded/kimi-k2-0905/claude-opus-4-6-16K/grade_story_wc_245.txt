<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mirael’s tactile cartography and interior contradiction—mapping everything except herself—are dramatized through the dowsing walk and the stillpoint breakdown; the embodied silence-tears beat shows cost. The lifelong loneliness is told more than tested before the forest, so the flaw-to-choice linkage is slightly front-loaded rather than compounded under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The melodic map cues (C → E-flat etc.) provide because-therefore breadcrumbs; the needle-swing and bark-press beats tighten options toward the stillpoint. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wax-tablet “Here” reweights her prior maps and carries the forest-silence seed outward—felt cost is the irreversible substitution of inner resonance for outer sight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Body-as-setting and the ring-as-tool constrain every tactical move; ultrasonic trees are not backdrop but active chorus that literally pushes her shins and re-tunes her blood. Spatial choreography is clean from sentinel pine to quartz ridge; the final image keeps the silent seed as charged object, satisfying the 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the stillpoint to map herself—is signaled in paragraph four and narrows through musical-interval directions; each harmonic command forecloses wrong turns. Cost is legible when silence obliterates even her heartbeat, forcing the weeping stance crystallization. No reversal after entry, but the single tightening is sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of cartography: exterior maps vs. interior silence; no explicit thesis stated. The seed-of-silence image reconfigures prior “ten thousand languages” into one inaudible melody—resonant without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will she replant or hoard the silence? Complexity maintained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“forest sang beyond hearing”) and sustained through patterned elision (“hours passed, or perhaps years”). Tactile perceptual signature—“stirred marrow,” “hummed against her shins”—remains consistent; no head-hopping. Final cadence matches the hush: “walked back into the noise of being alive” recharges opening song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long lyrical stacks to the fragment “Absolute, oceanic silence.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map, body, or silence. One register spike—“conceptual coordinate in the interior geography of grief and wonder”—is earned by prior worldbuilding, so artifact penalty waived. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Ultrasonic forest as cartographic score is a fresh synthesis; tactile language-absorption trait transforms standard quest into dermal navigation. Risk in skipping visual description pays off: blindness becomes plot engine, not token. Specificity of interval-directions (“C to E-flat: veer left”) makes the magic rule feel discovered, not invented for convenience.</comment>
