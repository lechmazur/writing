<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—yearning for belonging while scorning it—drives every beat; the notebook swap is a tangible micro-choice that externalizes this. Embodied emotion is vivid: “a knot she had carried so long she had forgotten it was not part of her anatomy.” The Keeper’s gender-smoke and bone-framed stone give secondary pressure without crowding the choreography. Closure earns its cost: she leaves the architecture of meaning behind, heart finally “room enough to ache”—a credibly flawed, irreversible stance.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (glowing apples, marrow-soaked roots) thickens the psychic weight until the notebook surrender crystallizes a cadence shift. Orientation anchors within 40 words; no teleporting props. The Ten of Cups reprise at exit reweights the stake without explanatory nudge. Closure is a Charged Poise: empty hands + dusky resolve = undeniable conceptual cost; the hole stops widening, path foreclosed.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but tactical resource—roots crack skulls to feed, apples swallow candle-fire, constraining Maren’s gait and lantern use. The Barter Stone’s bone frame literally limits where she can place the notebook. Half-lit corridor glow functions as micro-clock, tightening each step. Final image of “morning somewhere above” is charged by the phosphor-apple light she carries out, recycling the motif as promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—permission to feel want—signals early via the charred card. Escalation is textural: each ossuary detail thickens the cost of denial until the notebook surrender forces the tightening. No reversals needed; pressure accrues like sap in ghost-apples. The price is legible: she trades her entire “architecture of meaning” for the right to ache—an irrevocable forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particular burned card → notebook → empty hands sequence: self-denial is not transcendence but slow self-exile. Subtext in the Keeper’s “particular tenderness of someone who had witnessed every form of grief” implies refusal is ordinary, not heroic. No moral spoken; final ache is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will the hole ever close?—invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Maren’s perceptual filter: roots “snake between femurs and ribs” mirrors her invasive guilt. Syntax lengthens under introspection, shortens on the stone (“She left the notebook.”). No head-hopping; Keeper’s shifting gender stays external, smoke-like. Diction stays within her lexicon—“trammel,” “phosphorescence”—no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer sentences in orchard gloom, crystalline staccato at closure. No scaffold; each line adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors are coherent—apples “swallowed a candle” sustains the glow motif. Zero paraphrase loops; “meaning…not the same as healing” is first and only articulation. Final clause “room enough to ache” lands as earned compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Destiny-bartering under ossuary trees is fresh, yet avoids gimmick by grounding in Maren’s concrete loneliness. Tarot-as-wound rather than prophecy device transforms familiar trope. Notebook-as-soul-scaffold feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: lyric accumulation over causal plot, but coherence holds. Specific detail—“blackened crescent” of painted family—prevents abstract anywhere-ness.</comment>
