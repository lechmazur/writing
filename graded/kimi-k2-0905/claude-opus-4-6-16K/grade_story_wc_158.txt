<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Centuries-old insomnia and compulsion to witness every hour give Maren a sharp, specific interior engine; the “bloom” choice at the end feels inevitable because her refusal to sleep has been dramatized as both wound and method. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene—she never debates waking vs. sleeping on the page—so the final surrender reads more mythic than psychologically tested. Still, the embodied cost (corroded memory, physical curling into the alcove) is vivid and scales to the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza inked on the shell adds density until the postcard pattern-break reweights everything. The single micro-turn—armistice announced via galaxy postcard—lands with conceptual cost: centuries of vigilance suddenly obsolete. Orientation is taught early (“spiraling upward from the ocean floor”) and closure image (“bloom”) repays the pattern. Causality is mythic rather than sequential, acceptable under lyric design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shell-as-cathedral is not backdrop but instrument: the tightening spiral literally compresses her body, forcing the final fetal “ensconce” that triggers sleep. Bioluminescent constellations and squid-ink stanzas are selective, never touristic. The galaxy postcard arrives through a pre-existing apex crack—setting supplies the vector, not coincidence. Micro-setting (alcove squeeze) constrains the climactic choice, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep witnessing or allow sleep?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens when the postcard neutralizes her raison d’être; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is accretive: each wall stanza raises the emotional buy-in, so the armistice news feels like a dropped match in a powder room. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible—loss of identity as the sleepless archivist—visible in the single whispered word “bloom.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of flowering as response to violence: orchards, bioluminescent blossoms, final “bloom.” No character spells out the moral; the galaxy image reweights the shell’s spiral as cosmic kin, offering quiet stasis instead of victory. Refusal to tidy pain into triumph keeps complexity alive. The reef-shadow joy idea is named once yet pervades the final cadence, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: rust-ink smells, coral throat, logarithmic curve felt along her spine. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breathing—perfect control under pressure. No head-hopping; mythic register is maintained without slipping into encyclopedic voice. The humming lullaby line (“off-key wind”) is the only audible dialogue, functioning as action, not ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic—long swells, then short crests (“She wrote: bloom.”). Figurative density stays purposeful; every metaphor services the swallowed-sky motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor filter verbs appear (“she felt”) but are earned by centuries-long focal distance. Closing sentence varies pace to match hush of first sleep, propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell-cathedral housing an insomniac poet who inks wars into coral is fresh, yet grows from familiar pearl-around-irritant logic, making the surreal feel inevitable. Postcard of a galaxy that mirrors the shell’s spiral collapses macro/micro in a single visual charge. Risky lyric structure pays off because pattern is taught early and closure reprises it. Not quite 9+ because the blossom-armistice device is externally delivered rather than protagonist-unearthed.</comment>
