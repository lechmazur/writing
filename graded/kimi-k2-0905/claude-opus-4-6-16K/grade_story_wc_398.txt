<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—tending mismatched vines while counseling a stranger to accept mismatch—anchors her quietly persuasive authority; the girl’s hollowed-out cello voice and deliberate bus-miss grant immediate credibility. Micro-choices (handing over the charred edge, standing without permission) reveal hierarchy of values. Only slight flattening: the girl’s skepticism→hunger shift is told more than embodied, keeping her just shy of full three-dimensionality. Cost is visible when both walk downslope, foreclosing the midnight exit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Situational lens: the empty vineyard becomes a crucible that crystallizes stance. After the bus leaves, every beat is “therefore” the two must confront the stuck moment; the burned letter fragment is the tightening object that reweights options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the offer of Maren’s hand reconfigures both women’s next hours with undeniable social/emotional cost—no transport, only the slow walk into unfamiliar rows. Orientation, anchors, and causality remain clean; no info teleports.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion’s honey lattice and frost-brittle grass filter every beat; the Tempranillo row’s unruly canes physically constrain the final invitation to “show me.” Sensory hierarchy (visual chill, tactile crunch) mirrors emotional narrowing. Weather and micro-terrain guide choice: the slope’s incline literalizes descent into acceptance. Final image—two silhouettes among rogue vines—recharges the mismatched-soil premise; setting is not backdrop but active collaborator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether the girl will enact self-punishing exile (symbolic death in vacant night) or risk re-framed connection. Tightening occurs when Maren confesses paternal failure→personal reinvention, proving mismatch can be re-cultivated rather than eradicated. Agency stays with the girl: she requests the row visit, foreclosing passive despair. Cost is legible: dawn bus forfeiture, exposure to stranger’s truth, and the social vulnerability of accepting guidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mismatches are not failures of destiny but invitations to altered cultivation. Subtext operates through viticultural metaphor rather than thesis—no character declares “accept imperfection.” Final image answers the core question non-literally: the walk among Tempranillo becomes a living rebuttal to “wrong from the start.” Complexity lingers: Maren’s cure required twenty years and another’s labor, hinting unseen costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—vine-centric noticing, tactile certainty, autumnal color bias. Diction (“dormant acres,” “unruly canes”) is vine-grower specific, never academic. Compression is taught early (“dissolving taillights”) and paid off in final cadence of descending footsteps. No head-hopping; girl’s interior is read through gesture and voice quality, maintaining modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose carries vineyard sensuality without purple overload: “copper leaves of a dying season” is the single allowed flourish, earned by sparse surrounding description. Sentence rhythm alternates between long vine-clauses and short, spoken exchanges, propelling momentum. Zero loops, no scaffold; every clause advances image or pressure. Opening and closing lines act as frame and reprise, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—elder mentors stranger in vacant landscape—is refreshed through viticultural conceit that mismatched grapes make a unique rosé. Specificity of northern Tempranillo failure and cold-fermentation fix feels non-transferable. Final invitation to “show me the row” converts metaphor into shared motion, avoiding moralizing. Risk is moderate but successful; no gimmick, no trend-chasing.</comment>
