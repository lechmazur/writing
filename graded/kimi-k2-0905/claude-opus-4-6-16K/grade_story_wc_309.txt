<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara’s ache of “unnecessary” is embodied through tactile micro-choices—saving, carrying, pressing the keystone—so renunciation/stance crystallization feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“stone accommodated impossibilities”) rather than label-speak. One contradiction (“clumsy yet stubbornly persistent”) drives every beat, and the final weep carries visible cost. Still, no secondary pressure or status shift on the page caps the upper band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s lingering glow reweights the premise—automation’s sterility vs. soul-truth—at undeniable conceptual cost (“the sacred had been here all along”). Accumulative lens holds: pattern of construct perfection → imperfect warmth intensifies until the ice-top cry freezes the new value. Orientation anchored at ~110 words; zero causality breaks. No persistent price shapes later tactics, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The grandmother-carved keystone as micro-setting constrains every footstep: warmth against freezing air, steadiness against shifting cloud. “Brilliant dimness” sky and “sunlight scattered through ice crystals” filter through Elara’s bias, guiding the mist-walk belief test. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from greenhouse to spire is tracked via 900-mile summary, not felt. Setting charges the final image—the glow pooled on ice—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove imperfect meaning matters—tightens once: mist walk requires faith constructs lack, forcing Elara to bet her life on “clumsy” value. Cost is legible (she could fall) but not paid; success diffuses pressure. Escalation comes via accumulative density, not added risk. Still, agency drives every ascent step and final memory-press, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: construct perfection dissolves vs. flawed stone persists. No moralizing—final weep simply revalues the premise. “Lingering luminance” reweights from decorative phrase to ontological proof, achieving CR. Particulars (crooked vine, humming summer) keep universals grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensory register—limestone “pressed into her palms like living things.” Rhythm swells with ascent, then quietens into architectural silence. No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct. Compression (“nine hundred miles” in four words) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines multitask—“frost gathered on her eyelashes” advances climb, shows cold cost. Mixed metaphors absent; only one filter verb cluster mid-ascent. No loops or scaffold. Final third is clean, allowing 9-band eligibility, but one near-paraphrase (“silence so complete it felt architectural”) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Automation vs. soul is familiar territory, yet the keystone’s “accommodates impossibilities” property and mist-walk faith-test give concrete, non-obvious mechanics. Risk—lyric ascent without antagonist—heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Story would collapse if keystone swapped for any trinket, proving specificity.</comment>
