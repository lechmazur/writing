<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is gorgeously particular—“the frequency of her longing, calibrated now to this world”—and the endurance of uncertainty is embodied in blue fingers and frost-matted hair. Yet every beat is ultimately receptive; she never hazards a micro-choice that could fail, so the arc is a steady state rather than earned renunciation. Still, the cost is felt in physical damage and dimensional homesickness, satisfying the 9- gate for character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the final “one breath the garden glowed… then it passed” provides Charged Poise with unmistakable cost. Orientation is swift—wall, pendant, mist, frost—and causality obeys dream-logic taught early. One tightening only, but it reweights the stake of enduring uncertainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not backdrop; its ice splits books open and releases sentences the guardian absorbs through skin, directly constraining her stance. Pendant, wall, mist, and frost-crystals recur with shifting charge, culminating in the boundary-softening glow. Micro-setting (the wall she mortars with books) enables the final image of interior/exterior collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—gains density via accumulating images rather than option-narrowing turns. Traveler’s arrival supplies a micro-turn, yet confrontation is refused, so pressure plateaus. Cost is atmospheric rather than tactical; sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but not high-band escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of light-boundary imagery and the guardian’s refusal to domesticate ambiguity. Final image reweights earlier motifs without exposition. No moralizing; resonance is felt in bodily cold and dimensional ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the guardian’s perceptual bias—every detail is filtered through frost-numbed attention. Syntax lengthens and contracts with mist, matching the “veil of sleep” cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within her plausible lexicon of half-remembered physics of light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, world-rule—without scaffold. Only two adjacent near-repeats (“interiorizing exteriors… interior/exterior”) but pattern is intentional. Metaphors stay coherent inside frozen-garden physics; no mixed vehicles or register drift near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Dimensional homesickness” and “befriending uncertainty” synthesize into a fresh emotional axis. Frost-bound library-garden feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk resides in near-static plot, but lyric accumulation justifies the gamble and lands clean.</comment>
