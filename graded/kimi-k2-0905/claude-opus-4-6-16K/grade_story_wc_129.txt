<comment>Sable’s interiority is concrete—her sculptor’s eye reads pressure traces in bark and her own hunger to belong is embodied in the orchard’s cold glass. The contradictions between solitude and grafting are held in scene, not lecture. Ren’s bold sympathy is shown through physical risk (weeping, hand-holding) rather than labels. The final three-hand press on the arbor earns a palpable cost: warmth surrendered to cold glass, diaspora surrendered to new cambium.</comment>

<comment>The causal lens holds: because Sable recognizes marsh-reed technique in the glyphs, she and Ren locate Cael; because Cael is found, the elders permit the arbor carving; because the carving happens, belonging is re-crystalized. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (crystalline orchard, crater rim). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: names cut into obsidian plus the shared palm-press reweight “home” from absence to shared sap flow; the cost is the audible scrape of knife on glass and the irreversible surrender of outsider status.</comment>

<comment>The crystalline orchard is never mere backdrop: glass branches fracture light into “prismatic veins” that mirror Sable’s splintered longing; the obsidian arbor’s cold surface literally absorbs the warmth of the dedication, charging the final image. Micro-setting inside the arbor’s hollow and the reed-fiber stylus left in Cael’s pocket serve as tactile pivots. Spatial choreography stays clean as characters move between outer rows and the central volcanic tree.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when the elders dangle the arbor-carrot: find the tagger or remain outsider. Each discovered glyph narrows options until the final knife-stroke forecloses anonymity forever. Cost is visible: Sable’s worn knife, Ren’s openly wept tears, Cael’s decades of waiting. Agency stays with the protagonists; coincidence merely reveals, never resolves.</comment>

<comment>The theme of reinvented kinship emerges through the grafting metaphor carried from first paragraph to last image; no character moralizes the idea. Subtext lives in silence: the hummed songs without lyrics, the hand placed beside another without speech. The luminescent ache shifts from solitary longing to shared fluorescence once three palms warm the obsidian, reweighting “home” without a thesis statement.</comment>

<comment>The third-person lyric voice maintains a reed-sculptor’s tactile diction—“bundled marsh reeds,” “cambium layers pressing”—without drifting into catalog tourism. Syntax lengthens and contracts with emotional temperature; short clauses under the obsidian mimic knife-cuts. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Sable’s artisan eye. Dialogue-free design is honored; the single spoken tag line from Ren is idiomatic and goal-driven.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is nearly loop-free; only one soft paraphrase (“aching and beautiful at once” echoed by “luminescent ache”) is allowed because it functions as thematic reprise. Metaphors stay internally coherent—glass/obsidian imagery never contradicts itself. Sentence rhythm varies from long liquid lines to fragment-cuts during carving. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; information density is high without purple overload.</comment>

<comment>The marsh-reed sculptor diaspora grafted onto crystal-fruit orchard is a fresh synthesis; the tag-hunt as rite-of-acceptance recodes graffiti into diaspora signal. Obsidian arbor as communal ledger literalizes “rootstock” in volcanic glass—an image not seen in standard exile tropes. Risk is taken in a near-wordless world, yet emotional clarity is preserved. Specificity of stylus pressure patterns and cambium alignment makes the premise feel discovered rather than assembled.</comment>
