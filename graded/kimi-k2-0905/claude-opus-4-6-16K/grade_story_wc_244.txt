<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marta’s interior contradiction—efficient at mass care, allergic to one-to-one intimacy—drives every beat; the moon-rock reply is a credible micro-choice that risks the only safety she trusts. The “desperately jocular” register is embodied (kissing the rock, puns in three languages) rather than labelled. Cost is legible: she forfeits her erasure protocol and lets the station become a social node, a visible relinquishment on the last page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the moon rock relocated to the windowsill crystallizes the shift from hidden to hospitable under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each gift/letter arrive because Marta answered the first, and the final image reweights the ivy-covered station as cradle not ruin. Cost is irrefutable—her solitude is foreclosed in front of the reader.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ivy-furred platform, roofless office, and pigeon-cluttered departures board are filtered through Marta’s logistician eye (inventory, light, ingress) and constrain her choices—she can’t leave without abandoning a now-social hub. The moon rock’s “borrowed light” re-illuminates the setting in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she tolerate reciprocal presence?—tightens when the first reply letter is mailed; each new gift is a micro-intensification under Accumulative lens. Price is visible: visitors sleep on her platform, her private language of puns is now public currency. No reversal, but a deepening that makes retreat impossible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: unsolicited gifts → answered gifts → mutual cradle, stated only via the final lighthouse metaphor. Subtext in silence—she never says “I’m lonely” yet the ivy’s cradling of the station mirrors her own containment. No moralizing; the moon rock’s glint re-prices solitude as shared artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tight to Marta’s perceptual filter: logistical calibrations, light angles, pigeons as inventory. “Desperately jocular” diction permeates narration (“politely anarchic,” “cosmic joke delivered by postal service”) without slipping into writerly flourish. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during the catalytic letter beat, then eases into the final lyrical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, character beat, and metaphoric charge (“The ivy had eaten the railway station so thoroughly that newcomers sometimes mistook it for a hill”). No looped phrasing; metaphors stay consistent (ivy = cradle, moon = borrowed light). A single paraphrase slip—“she told herself she was hiding” restates prior line—drops 0.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—ex-logistician repaying unsolicited moon rock with epistolary anarchy—is fresh; ivy-swallowed station as social node rewilds both building and psyche. Tropes (recluse, gift economy) are inverted: aid worker flees intimacy yet is forced into micro-exchanges. Final lighthouse image grows organically from “borrowed light” motif established with NASA card.</comment>
