<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s motive to “speak back” erased names is legible and personal; the lens-press against her hip keeps embodiment present. Interior contradiction flickers—duty vs. fatigue—but never sharpens into a decisive, costly choice this scene; she simply obeys the next tug. No live relationship under pressure (single on-page character) means crucible and status shifts are N/A. Still, her perceptual lens is specific and consistent, meriting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: mural testimony transferred to canvas backs makes the erased history portable—felt cost is the fresh ink staining “his” canvases and the glow dimming in the wall. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lifted canvas adds weight of recovered names until the final image reweights Maren’s vocation. Orientation is anchored before 120 w; one causal micro-turn (lens-fold → translation) suffices. Deduction only for soft causality on why paint-seller relinquishes wall so easily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Market planks, sway, glass-bead canopy, and lens fragment as micro-setting constrain every footstep and refraction choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt-rot wood, clove smoke, refracted light—never catalog. Environment plus tool (lens) jointly enable the final translation; removal of either breaks the beat. High-band gate met: object charges closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor erased lamplighters—surfaces early and tightens when lens-fold forces Maren to speak the names aloud, risking exposure in a public stall. One meaningful deepening occurs: mural glow dims only after ink is committed, signalling irreversible linkage of her life to theirs. Cost is present (time, ink, visibility) but not yet painful—stakes intensify yet stop short of tangible personal loss this scene. Sufficient for high-low band, not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory vs. civic amnesia emerges solely through action—unfastening, translating, writing on canvases—never abstract assertion. Final image of westward walk with “old light” in pocket reconfigures theme: recovered past becomes portable burden. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether one woman can carry an entire city’s forgetting. Resonance is earned via specific particulars, meriting upper band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature (“pressure change before a storm that you feel in your teeth”) is distinct and consistent. Syntax modulates from languid reflective cadences to tight, tactile verbs during lens-fold. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Elision of market’s larger politics is purposeful and paid off in closure. Meets 9-band technical control with only hairline slip of one adverbial clause overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive—sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts are clean. Figurative language is selective (“sentences hung... like suspended lanterns”) and never clutters the pivotal translation beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density high. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) nicks perfection but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of hidden mural-code is refreshed by combining maritime lighthouse guild, rooftop alchemy market, and grandmother salvage—specificity makes fusion feel inevitable. Translator-lens trope gains new angle: archival activism rather than mere sight. Risk in quiet, low-dialogue vignette pays off via charged poise ending. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing story logic.</comment>
