<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her “tinkerer’s wonder” at the machines, the cot-notebooks—yet her contradictory impulses (mute composer vs. desperate encoder) stay asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. The final sung ballad is credible payoff, but the moment of first singing feels summarized, not micro-chosen under pressure; hence the cost is felt but not visibly paid in a beat we witness. Still, the occupation-specific perceptual lens is sustained and the flaw is below closure threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard gallery of murals crystallizes a new, ongoing mutual audience; cost is the irreversible absorption of both women into signal-cloud art. Causal chain intact—each mural answers the last, the bolt plate key is set up, the singing causes feed-back anomalies—so Accumulative/Textural lens holds. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50. Persistent constraint: once Elin is code, exit is impossible; this charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Cirrus Relay is not postcard backdrop—stone walls receive paint only during lightning-thin EM veil, courtyard stone becomes cipher pad, mist curls through colonnade like “something curious and alive,” guiding Maren to west wall. The flower press bolt plate micro-object functions as setting fragment that later constrains decoding action. Sensory economy perfect: no weather cliché, every cloud or gear mention filtered through Maren’s technician priorities. Final image of lightning-illuminated murals charges earlier visual motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unheard voice seeking audience—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is Accumulative: each storm adds a mural, each calm adds a reply, tightening the mutual dependence until singing into the network is the only remaining avenue. Cost is legible: anonymity and human form sacrificed (Elin) and seven-year silence broken (Maren). No coincidence; all turns arise from encoding/decoding actions under EM-veil physics established early.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as survival code for isolation, communication when speech fails. Murals and ballads reweight from mere ornament to life-support, enacting the theme rather than asserting it. Final image—anomalies of melody in the data-stream—offers Conceptual Repricing: society’s cold infrastructure repurposed into covert duet. No moralizing; complexity (eternal half-life in code) stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder with technician’s diction—”driftingly alert,” “tinkering devotion,” “electromagnetic veil”—a perceptual signature rarely heard in genre. Rhythm modulates: long sensorial sentences for calm, clipped fragments during lightning reveal. No head-hop; Elin’s POV is inferred only through artifact. Compression (“seven years, unheard”) is taught pattern, paid off when anomalies sing back.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative choices precise: mist “like something curious and alive” externalizes Maren’s half-dream alertness. No mixed metaphors; lightning-thunder interval stays physics-coherent. High density: “paint mixed from lichen and mineral dust” does world, character, and process in five words. Closure sentence—”turning still”—is concise music-box image that recurs to first paragraph’s wonder.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-in-code trope crossed with botanist-cipher graffiti activated only during lightning, enacted by female technician-balladeers. Risk of EM-veil rule paid off in causal murals. Details specific to this aerie above permanent cloud sea; could not swap in generic haunted spaceship. Conceptual commitment total—no retreat to conventional ghost morphology. Final tinkersong image is new tonal note in speculative fiction.</comment>
