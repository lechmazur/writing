<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elska’s embodied patience and the heartbeat-to-map translation give concrete, idiosyncratic interiority; the maternal drive is visceral and consistent. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the arc is slightly too smooth for the 9-band, but the cost—frozen knees, solitary vigil—is felt. Micro-choices (pressing flash-paper to copper, folding edges) enact her hierarchy of values without exposition. Motive sustains pressure and earns the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each discarded item layer and starlight sip thickens texture toward the charged poise of the glowing plate; closure lands with conceptual cost—Elska’s body and time are spent, the orchard remains barren, but Maren will feel home. Causality of pattern-building is legible; no prop or rule breaks. Orientation is anchored by line 3; world-pause taught early and repaid in final auroral breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard, copper plate, and flash-paper all constrain tactics (cold limits stamina, plate size dictates starlight dosage). The dead trees’ skeletal geometry mirrors the heartbeat spirals, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elska’s alchemical focus: tactile cold, visual star-bareness, auditory hush. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver starlight warmth to blind daughter—remains coherent. Escalation is textural: each pattern ring and absorbed photon tightens the cost of failure. No reversal, but the final seal forecloses retreat; the price is her bodily endurance. Stakes are visceral, not abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of maternal cartography—mapping love across impossibility—emerges from the iterative pattern-making, never stated. Starlight-as-love reframes astronomical scale as tactile intimacy. Final image reweights earlier orchard death into portable bloom. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is alchemical—measures, textures, temperatures. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath and cold; no template cadence. Vocabulary stays within Elska’s trained lexicon (“flash-paper alchemist,” “substrate”). No dialogue to distort voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic variation mirrors vigil pacing; sentences compress during seal, expand during star-gathering. Metaphors (“crooked fingers,” “breath ghost”) are spare and precise, never chained. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing maternal grief with alchemy-of-starlight in a dead orchard feels fresh; heartbeat cartography is novel method. Premise is not derivative; speculative element grows from emotional need. Risk of lyric stillness pays off in luminous closure. Specificity of copper plate etched with child-reaching-apple cements uniqueness.</comment>
