<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sable’s guilt and need to “find where lost time accumulates” are sharply embodied; her decision to trace her palm into the moss and renounce reading strangers’ futures is earned by the preceding interior weight. Contradictory impulses—yearning for reclaimed time vs. acceptance of irretrievability—co-exist in the same beats. The only minor slack: her cartomancer competence is asserted more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the saucer-crack’s moonlit glint reweights the premise—lost time is not retrieved but transmuted into “the glade,” an altitude of beauty that still costs her absence from her child. Causal linkage holds: because she climbs under grief’s pull, therefore she reaches the cloud glade and redefines time-loss as cloudbound repentance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by ~80 words and payoff glade mnemonic. Cost is visible: the hairline crack becomes the luminous path home, undeniable.</comment>

<comment>The cloud-suspended glade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: only grief-heavy hearts can ascend; moss cold under palm dictates the tracing ritual. Sensory hierarchy follows Sable’s cartomancer bias—moonlight read like “columns in a ruined cathedral,” scent of rain-never-touched-soil. Spatial choreography is clean: ascent, kneel, spread, trace, descent track without drift. No 9+ because environment does not further tighten tactics mid-scene; once reached, glade is static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she find a reservoir of recoverable time?—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: cards reveal time does not pool for reclamation, forcing acceptance. Agency remains hers: she performs the hand-trace ritual and elects descent. Cost is conceptual yet legible: she forsakes future-telling for strangers, embracing maternal present; crack-image glows as permanent reminder of irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: lost time is not behind but above, transfigured into beauty that chokes. Saucer-crack reweights from damage to compass, achieving resonance without moralizing. No late thesis statement; final image of moon-filled crack pointing home delivers non-literal answer to “where lost time goes.” Minor abstraction “cloudbound repentance” is named only once and filtered through grandmother idiom, escaping full thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyrical-fantastical: selective perceptions (“onyx-ink cards swallowing lamplight”), ritual cadence, cartomancer’s diction of “disc of moss,” “architecture of clouds.” Syntax lengthens then fragments under awe, mirroring breath. Compression taught early (“she ascended the mountain path that threaded above the cloudline”) and paid off in final saucer-glint. No head-hopping; interior access calibrated to Sable’s knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: opening clause-stack lifts like ascent; shorter pulses mark ritual beats. Figurative density peaks early then clears for closure image, avoiding muddle. No paraphrase loops; “time” recurs but accrues new valence each time. One near-scaffold: “beauty so acute it closed around her throat” could compress, yet it advances atmosphere and stakes, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-recovery arc is inverted: instead of retrieving time, protagonist accepts its transmutation into sublime altitude—specific, non-obvious. Fusion of cartomancy, cloud glade, and tablecloth-hand ritual feels fresh synthesis rather than checklist. Risk in lyrical exposition succeeds because pattern taught early and closure legible. Hairline-crack/saucer payoff acts as small, particular pivot no trope template supplies.</comment>
