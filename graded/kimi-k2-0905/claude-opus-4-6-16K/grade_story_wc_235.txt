<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—yearning for past selves while chronicling dreams to survive the present—are embodied in trembling hands and the act of writing itself. The micro-choice to keep transcribing despite knowing her death-date is credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; “jaded wonder” is lived, not labeled. Missing 9+ because no second on-page character means relationship/status crucible is absent by scope, not flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of writing while the feral thing howls reweights stakes—she cedes the timeline to the dreams. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each recalled dream tightens the density of memory-loss until the grave-date becomes irrelevant. Orientation is anchored by ~120 wds (cabin, scroll, Cascades). Cost is legible—“the grave could have its dates. She would keep the dreams”—a forfeit of linear life for recursive memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The birch scroll functions as micro-setting: handled in opening, middle (writing), and closure—its surface “already covered” mirrors her filled-up memory. Cabin and range constrain solitude and supply the altitude that “loosened something feral,” directly enabling the stakes. Sensory selectivity—“pine resin and old ink,” “snowline turned gold”—filters through Maren’s chronicler bias. Scroll+body+cabin together charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill chaos into narrative before death—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each blurred dream entry tightens the fear that none of it is real. Final renunciation (keep dreams, ignore grave) forecloses linear escape with visible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular recurrence: the meadow dream, the thermal, the scroll—final soar reconfigures death into surrender rather than endpoint. Subtext in “jaded wonder” is lived through image, not asserted. No moralizing; complexity remains—“cosmic joke of consciousness” invites counter-readings. Resonant reprice lands in last line’s “inconsolable howl.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: chronicler’s cataloguing gaze, synesthetic nostalgia “like weather,” compression that matches dream-time. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentence for meadow flight, then short declaratives for grave acceptance. No head-hop; distance stays deep interior. Prose is character: syntax mirrors obsessive accretion of detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, memory, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“grief and wonder fused into a single updraft” charges closure without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional peaks. No artifact touches final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—seeing own grave then choosing recursive dream-life over linear escape—is fresh synthesis of mortality + oneiric memoir. Risk in non-linear memory-blur pays off because pattern taught early and closure legible. Specificity of ranger cabin + birch scroll keeps it from abstract template. Emotional specificity of envying past selves avoids generic “time is fleeting” trope.</comment>
