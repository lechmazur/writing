<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s tactile, sound-first expertise is embodied in every micro-choice; her passive “guide by whisper” agency still effects Fen’s shift from tech-arrogance to listening, a credible renunciation with felt cost. The interior contradiction—clinging to a key that fits nothing yet refusing digitization—drives the central tension. Fen’s arc is thinner but sufficient foil; his stride-change is a readable status drop. All motivation stays inside her perceptual limits, no knowledge leaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Fen pockets the phone and unfolds a map—an earned, visible cost that reweights both their stances. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory fragment (hum, coin-slot, star-chart) layers density until the final crystalline hush. No teleporting props; the coin’s slot is foreshadowed by the floor-weld memory. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no ambiguity caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop but acoustic instrument—its corrugated throats literally channel whispers and swallow shouts, constraining tactics mid-scene. Specificity is selective: “strobing aurora through the ceiling gap” and “house-paint constellations” charge the final image. Micro-setting (fold creases, brass key) functions as extension of body. Weather/electromagnetic flux causally warps metal and sound, tightening options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove intuition beats digitization—is signaled early and tightens when GPS fails. One meaningful escalation: Maren’s whispered directions become the only viable path, forcing Fen’s gait to switch from arrhythmic stealth to attentive heel-to-toe. Cost is visible: he pockets the phone, surrendering his metric. No reversal for Maren, but her method’s authority is reaffirmed with conceptual price—her maps remain irreproducible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: knowledge encoded in bodily listening vs. abstract grids. The star-chart inside the container reconfigures “navigation” from satellite to hand-painted myth—conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext sits in Fen’s pocketed phone: silence as acquiescence. Final hush invites reflection on what kinds of maps we trust; ambiguity lingers, charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s sonic perceptions; diction (“metal throats,” “aurora the color of a bruise lit from within”) is hers. Sentence rhythm mimics her cadence—long liquid clauses for calm, clipped fragments when the storm hum spikes. No head-hopping; Fen’s interior is read only through his changing footfalls. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she saw his confident stride falter”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sound, stake, or image. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“whisper slid down the corridor like water finding a channel” is the single extended metaphor, paid off when Fen hears it. Strong verbs (“shattered,” “pooling,” “fracturing”) carry motion. Opening and closing lines bookend with acoustic imagery, creating cadence arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + container port = live acoustic maze; none of the prompt elements feel grafted. The folded-map crease logic is a genuine invention that digitization cannot replicate. Risk in quiet climax—no shouting confrontation—heightens coherence. Transformation test fails if relocated: the port city’s forgotten cargo ecology is irreplaceable.</comment>
