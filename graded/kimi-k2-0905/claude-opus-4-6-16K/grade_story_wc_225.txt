<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maret’s guilt-driven fidgeting, tactile decoding, and final hand-stilling give a full embodied arc; the self-forgiveness is earned through seven years of visible penance. Prince Edric is sketched only as “brilliant and young,” so relationship pressure is thin, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: teaching the gambit → frozen village → decoding border → counter-move → thaw. Closure lands with conceptual cost—her hands “truly stilled” for the first time, signaling earned self-forgiveness. No teleporting props or causality breaks; tapestry notation is seeded early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen rain-beads, fraying tapestry, and warm platinum knight are tactile, selective, and directly constrain her decoding tactic. Micro-setting (the border’s loose filaments) functions as the pivot object, charging the final image. One decimal off 9 only because village geography beyond the chapel is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—undo the temporal freeze—tightens when she discovers the border code; each pulled thread narrows options toward the single valid knight move. Cost is legible: seven lost years culminate in the tremor when her hands finally still. Pressure escalates under causal linkage; no coincidence resolves the freeze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—atonement through patient attention—emerges from her tactile decoding and the final quiet “neither did you lose.” No moralizing; the tapestry’s lesson reframes guilt as lived time rather than error. Ambiguity remains: village unaware, prince still innocent, her solitude unspoken—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maret’s perceptual filter: rain as lenses, threads as notation, metal warm after seven years. Syntax mirrors her folding mind—parallel gerunds, tactile verbs—then calms into the single still moment. No head-hopping; register consistent with a chess tutor’s precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Pull, read, release” triad becomes rhythmic engine; no filler or loops. Mixed metaphors avoided; “amber of stopped time” and “woven hush” cohere. One hairline slip—“honest and warm and free” triple adjective—keeps it from a flat 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village plus tapestry-as-code fuses fantasy and textile puzzle in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Seventh Gambit as temporal law-bender refreshes chess-tutor trope. Risk: seven-year stasis compressed into <800 words, yet specificity (platinum thread, fourth corridor) anchors it.</comment>
