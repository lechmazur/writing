<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—body memory singing before cognition, grief tasted in phantom fruit, contradictory impulses to surrender vs. weave held in trembling hands. The micro-choice to swaddle the window crystallizes her hierarchy of values and carries visible cost (voice cracking, orchard exhale), earning the Earned Stasis closure. Flawless 9+ quick test met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by second paragraph; single-scene arc tightens through density of woven dawns and cadence of returning song until the mica window becomes Charged Poise. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—her voice cracks, realm exhales, night thins—reconfiguring meaning without tidy sunrise. Pattern taught early, held to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, mica layers, luminescent fruit, and the loom as micro-setting constrain every tactile move; spatial choreography remains exact. Sensory selection narrows to chill, scent, and pulse under crisis, mirroring internal thaw. Environment directly shapes the final swaddle act, satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—realm-death linked to her eroding memory—signaled in first 100 words. One meaningful deepening: copper-pear drop releases scent that triggers full lyric recall, tightening pressure and foreclosing surrender option. Cost legible in cracked voice and orchard shudder; no coincidence used to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory as living tissue emerges through concrete weaving and communal song; no abstract statement required. Final image of “morning felt” reweights entire orchard without moralizing, delivering resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in silent mica tremor and shared breath avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person intimate carries consistent perceptual signature—light that forgot its name, sap like cold honey—without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates with shuttle and song, breathes at pear drop, cracks at dawn release, mirroring emotional arc. Elision of time and syntax taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and internally coherent—no mixed metaphors. Information density high; paragraph cut test passed. Line-level artifacts absent from closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirror-world amnesia-orchard sung back to life feels fresh because causality runs through alchemical fruit-pulp threads and communal lyric rather than heroics. Specificity of woven dawn fabric and mica window resonance prevents trope recycling. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
