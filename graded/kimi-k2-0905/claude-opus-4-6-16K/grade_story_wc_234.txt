<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable’s contradictory fear-of-stay / need-to-return is alive in the whispered admission; the columella-touch and flare feel earned because the prior beats tether interior risk to the object. The micro-choice to set the fresh pocket sun on the spiral is a visible, costly fork that locks the change. Relationship crucible is quiet but present—Maren’s single touch supplies the external mirror that lets Sable externalize the density. Interiority stays specific to a light-handling worldview; only minor drift toward tidy epiphany keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “It’s us” reweights every earlier sun-hollow failure with undeniable relational cost. Accumulative lens holds—each spiral pass tightens meaning until the pocket sun holds transitory “us-light.” Causality intact: return → reveal test → flare. Orientation clear at 120-word line. Persistent constraint visible—the shell’s scale-rule shapes the final placement. No cost sentence break; the flare itself is the payable moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dual-light equilibrium (sky copper / ground coral) constrains the final color coordinate that flares, so environment directly charges closure—meets 9+ gate. Every sensory pick (ember respiration, basalt warmth) is filtered through Sable’s luminosity vocation. Spatial choreography clean: pocket sun placed on innermost whorl while both sit. Selective detail never stalls; one noun swap could not replace “ember nexus” without breaking the color-math climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture presence”—is signaled in graf two and tightens through spiral revalue test. Agency: she places the untrusted proof on the shell; that act ignites the flare, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the acceptance of impermanence made visible in the holding-yet-not-permanent sun. One pronounced deepening sufficient for 800-word frame; escalation stays accumulative under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refractive compression imagery rather than thesis statements: presence = accumulated revisits, not extractable light. Subtext lives in shell-handling and the unsaid years between friends. Final image answers the core question without moralizing. Slight over-articulation of “palette of resolve” concept nicks the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—“scientifically romantic” diction, color wavelengths in coral-copper axis, spiral math—carried through free indirect with rhythmic lift. Head-hop absent; single POV stable. Heightened moments compress syntax without losing clarity: “It’s warm… It’s us.” Voice modulation under pressure evident. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence leads avoid template. Information-dense lines (“wavelength, intensity, decay rate, all correct”) twin-task as exposition + character worldview. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor over-modifier cluster (“amber and rust… soft, perpetual embers”) is caught but does not touch closure. Zero artifacts in final third; propulsion clean.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Pocket-sun alchemist” and geothermal ember nexus synthesize fresh vocational magic that feels inevitable once declared. Spiral-shell as decision-archive reweights familiar “you can’t go home again” into measurable interior volume ratio—non-obvious turn. Stakes stay intimate, avoiding default apocalypse drift. Could edge 9+ with sharper risk in Maren’s withheld history.</comment>
