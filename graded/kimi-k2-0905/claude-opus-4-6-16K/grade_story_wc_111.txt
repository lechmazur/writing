<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s contradiction—lying to stay inside a system she despises—animates every beat; the marble ritual embodies remembered victories and present defiance. Her “wisely pragmatic” label becomes a lived paradox under the assessor’s gaze, not a static trait. Interiority stays concrete, sensory, and bent-backed, never drifting into abstract self-help talk. The final stance (“That is all the luck I have ever needed”) costs her the protection of numbers, so the arc lands with foreclosed options and earned poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each marble, hedge bend, and bloom/rot pairing thickens pattern until the assessor’s tablet buckles. Closure is a Charged Poise—the maze leans, numbers falter, Maren remains, cost visible in the exposed lie. Orientation beats arrive before 120 words; causality is not linear reversal but density reaching critical mass. No plot amnesia; every marble placed earlier re-enters the final image, re-weighted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The maze is not backdrop; its anomalous bend toward Maren’s path constrains the assessor’s reading and charges the final image. Micro-settings—cracked glass, copper wire, climbing roses blooming while browning—are handled in motion, not catalogue. Weather and plant physiology affect pruning choices and metaphorical temperature. Sensory hierarchy is pruned like the vines: scent of rot, weight of marble, visual green cathedral all filtered through an aging gardener’s priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is declared early: proof that gardens know their tenders. Pressure tightens when the assessor’s numbers cannot parse the hedge’s affectionate curve; Maren’s commemorative act is a quiet defiance that narrows her future to exposure. No coincidence rescues her; the tension is whether pattern will trump algorithm. Cost is the forfeiture of her numerical shield, felt in the assessor’s stunned silence.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vegetal disobedience rather than lecture: quantified luck versus accrued intimacy. The cracked marbles re-price “luck” itself—fracture as record of care, not flaw. No tidy moral; the system may still expel her, but the garden’s recognition is undeniable. Final image reframes earlier deception as honesty, achieving Conceptual Repricing without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited anchors tightly to Maren’s arthmetic perceptions; no POV drift into assessor’s mind. Syntax grows gnarled like old canes—“body bent and withered like the oldest canes she pruned”—mirroring her physical state. Polishing rhythm returns as tactile refrain, taught early and paid off under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: “It follows the light” evades while conceding nothing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; participle openings are few and sequential actions stay clear. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple stacks in the climax. Repeated “lean” motif accumulates rather than loops. Final sentence lands with cadential lift: “numbers disagreed… hedge swayed… even he could see it,” propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Luck-as-algorithm is familiar sf territory, but grounding it in horticultural intimacy and cracked commemorative marbles particularizes the trope. The maze’s sentient bend feels inevitable once the text equates decades of sweat with root-network memory. Risk is taken in quiet climax—no riot, no expulsion—yet coherence holds. Could swap names, but the specific vegetal logic and marble ritual would break, so transformation is present.</comment>
