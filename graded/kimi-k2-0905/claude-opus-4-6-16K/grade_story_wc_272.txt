<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to portraiture while her eye warps with grief—grounds every beat. The micro-choice to pin threads rather than graphite shifts her tactic and stakes. “She was not drawing faces inaccurately… she was drawing the way loss had taught her to see them” crystallizes the arc with visible cost. End-state acceptance carries credible forfeiture of ever “fixing” the likenesses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open-lid box reframes earlier fragmentation into deliberate record. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each failed portrait, thread, and salt-warped book layers density until the finalimage reweights meaning. “A container that could not contain” repackages the opening wrong-portrait motif with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—her perception remains fractured—shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-library’s salt-warped books, spiral stairs, and frayed velvet thread constrain method: thread-length limits how she maps distortion. Micro-setting (the broken box hinges) literally shapes the open-lid closure image. Selective sensory hierarchy—“bronze” low light narrowing to dangling threads—mirrors her eroding focus without ornament. Spatial coherence holds from floorboards to middle chamber to final descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she can re-see rather than repair—tightens when thread-mapping supersedes graphite. One meaningful deepening: realizing inaccuracy is data, not error, narrows options; she abandons erasure. Cost is legible: she forfeits ever producing a “true” portrait, embracing warped topology instead. Escalation is internal yet coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from material particulars: faulty portraits → thread cartography → open box = acceptance of unclosable grief. No moralizing; the final lens-metaphor concentrates rather than lectures. “What a voice sounds like when it cracks” offers resonant, non-literal answer to how loss redesigns perception. Refrains of wrongness and thread reweight across beats, culminating in luminous ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—visual proportions dissolve into topographic synesthesia. Syntax lengthens then fragments, mirroring the shift from graphite precision to thread vectors. Free-indirect distance stays stable; no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s syntactic hush (“did not close the lid”) modulates toward earned poise without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—description advances metaphor while moving body (climb, pin, descend). Figurative control disciplined: “mirror using only its dust” appears once, pays off in closure. Zero loops, no scaffold; “salt-warped books,” “hollow tooth” supply concrete idiosyncrasy. Rhythmic variance climbs then exhales with paragraph breaks that match beat transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Portraiture-via-topology feels non-obvious; loss-as-cartography reconfigures familiar grief trope. Broken tarot box repurposed as anti-archive reframes “failed” art without gimmickry. Risk of lyric essayistic mode pays off: closure still crystallizes stakes. Specificity—thread lengths, salt warp, unclosable lid—anchors universality in singular object life.</comment>
