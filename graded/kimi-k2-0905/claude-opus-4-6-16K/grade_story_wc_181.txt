<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s curator instinct and the micro-choice to carve her own face crystallize the nonlinear legacy; the embodied “brightened disquiet” is specific. Yet the interior contradiction between seeking forbidden knowledge and accepting pre-written fate is asserted more than dramatized in scene, keeping her shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal loop lands with undeniable cost: she must carve herself into the blank and leave it, sealing her pre-written participation. The bathroom mirror beat is the decisive hinge that teaches the nonlinear rule and reweights all prior journal cues; the closure is legible, charged, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The translucent orchard, breathable vacuum, and pistachio cameo are vivid, selective, and ultimately constrain the final act—she carves beneath the glowing tree. Spatial grounding is maintained; only the brief “stone building with a bathroom” risks white-room sketchiness, but the mirror’s light immediately re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten once: the blank must become her portrait and be left, foreclosing any escape from the loop. The tightening is singular but sufficient for the length; the cost is felt in the moment she begins to carve, yet the pressure curve is more conceptual than visceral, holding it below 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Love inheriting backward through time emerges without sermon, crystallized in the image of a self-carved shell left for an unborn child. The final reconfiguration—she already wrote the words she’s about to write—carries conceptual cost that reweights every prior journal entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats close to Maren’s perceptual bias—colors “that existed nowhere else in the known spectrum”—and sustains a hushed, reverent rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the lyric cadence is controlled and matches the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“light threaded the way veins are threaded with blood”—and never muddies causality. The final paragraph breathes exactly when the philosophical breakthrough lands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear grandmother-journal bequeathing a future-discovered asteroid orchard feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the pistachio-shell cameo reconfigures the trope of heirlooms into a time-looped self-portrait. Risky temporal circularity is committed to without gimmick, yielding a singular emotional sting.</comment>
