<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—rage vs. patience—cohere in every beat: she “wanted to tear down the Authority with her hands” yet presses her eye to the theodolite, a micro-choice that enacts the story’s central trade-off. Interiority is concrete and instrument-specific (“slow geometry of moon paths,” “ferric patterns that responded to the earth’s magnetic field”), never label-speak. The earned stasis of the final image—breath dissolving while ice preserves water—pays the visible cost of suppressed fury and is fully motivated by the causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonlit breath crystallizes her relinquishment of explosive rebellion for long-game cartographic truth, cost legible in “she was not yet free.” Accumulative lens holds: each nightly transit adds density until the archive itself becomes the decisive act. Orientation is anchored by word 54 (“basalt sanctuary after the lake froze over”), well inside the 120-word margin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Basalt columns, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are not backdrop but instruments: the viaduct calibrates compass, the ice preserves water’s power, the sanctuary shelters theodolite—each constrains or enables her choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys her surveyor’s gaze—starlight angles, ferric patterns—filtering description through professional priorities. Final image reuses the ice metaphor to reweight her stance, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. falsified maps—tightens via accretion: each nightly measurement forecloses the possibility of impulsive sabotage and narrows her path to the spring atlas. One meaningful deepening occurs when she “placed them beside the others. Forty-seven nights… forty-seven silent arguments”; the quantity itself becomes the tightening. Cost is visible in frozen breath and deferred freedom, though pressure is cumulative rather than sharply reversed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—patience as the most dangerous form of resistance—emerges through the iterated act of measuring, never asserted. Subtext resides in the ice/water metaphor: restraint preserves power without killing it, reconfigured in the final breath-image. No moralizing; the moonlit close offers conceptual repricing that reweights every prior transit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly bound to Maren’s surveyor idiom—“sextants and starlight,” “slow geometry of moon paths”—a perceptual signature that modulates under pressure: wind “screamed… she could feel the same scream building inside her chest.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally at climax. Rhythm mirrors emotional arc, from patient cataloguing to the single exhalation that ends it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description folded into motive: “mineral deposits had bloomed across its iron rails… she used these patterns to calibrate.” Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“stone of her rage”), never clogging high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines bookend with ice/breath coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforming cartographic fraud into a quiet lunar insurgence feels fresh; the profession itself drives plot and metaphor. Risk resides in renouncing explosive climax for accumulative quietude, fully committed. The ice-archive-breath triad is specific to this voice and cannot be swapped without collapsing the story’s logic.</comment>
