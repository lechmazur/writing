<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt-driven compulsion to apologise is embodied—cranking the magneto, breathing lavender that isn’t there. Her interior contradiction (“I should have believed you” vs pride) stays active in-scene, and the renunciation of perfection (“the only kind I know how to make”) costs her the old self-image. The only minor slip is a touch of self-diagnosis at peak beat (“I think I’ve been playing in the wrong key”), slightly softening the blade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the amber bottle warms, orchard hush outside, lavender scent = Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds—because Maren dismissed Elsbeth, therefore Elsbeth haunts, therefore Maren returns with copper and perfume to free her, narrowing to the imperfect miracle. Persistent constraint survives: the basement will fall, the lavender remains. Cost is legible in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oak shelves, foxed paper, and slatted light are filtered through Maren’s professional eye for resonance. The perfume bottle serves as micro-setting that constrains every tactical move—crank speed, wire tension, final warmth. Spatial choreography is clean: descent, spiral layout, ascent with warm bottle. One nip: “vaulted ceiling” is asserted twice in adjacent clauses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—free Elsbeth before bulldozers—signalled on page 1. Tightening occurs when Maren admits past dismissal, forcing her to crank faster, accepting residue as price. Agency is renunciation of clean exorcism; cost is the lavender ghost-smell she now carries. The orchard clock is mentioned but never materially alters crank timing, keeping this just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge through action, not thesis: every exorcism leaves residue, the final warm bottle reweights the concept from flaw to grace. Subtext in “gossip-column exorcist” and surgeons with shaking hands links social performance to spiritual failure. The last line refuses moral symmetry—arriving too late can still be enough—leaving charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person slips close to Maren’s nerve endings: “blade she’d never learned to hold.” Rhythm compresses under crank tension—short sentences, sensory slivers. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens believably. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, vibrating through crystal, preserving vocal distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “dust motes drifted…like eighth notes suspended between measures” shows air, light, and musical archive in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; varied openings propel. One mixed metaphor—“constellation of unplayed music”—is fleeting and does not blur the final image. Strong read-aloud cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” and electromagnetic séance fuse occult and science in a way that feels particular to Maren, not genre checklist. The lavender residue re-visions supernatural cleanup as artisanal flaw—fresh emotional calculus. The condemned music archive plus orchard demolition gives cosmic stakes intimate geography. Risk is moderate but coherent; no famous-scene echoes detected.</comment>
