<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The interiority is lush and character-specific—Maren’s synesthetic “capturing essence” method makes her motive tactile. Yet the final planting is executed with near-ceremonial calm; no contradictory impulse or visible cost is staged in the beat itself, so the renunciation reads as serene rather than charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the seed’s first root visibly crosses the seam, reweighting the worlds’ color exchange with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final hush crystallizes the stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet crack, moss, and mist function as micro-setting; the waterfall’s succor literally nourishes the seed and constrains planting locale. Sensory triage matches Maren’s painterly perception—color values are noticed before spatial ones. Final image of “something green and ancient” is charged by this exact place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s color—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the two-way bridge risk is acknowledged. The single micro-turn (planting despite vulnerability) narrows options: she accepts possible dimming of the other world. Cost is legible in the closing “radiant hush” that now carries latent menace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chromatic economy: color as memory and moral debt. The silence of unopened buds and the graying earth create understated ecological grief. Final reweighting—color may flow back, but at a price—lands without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains anchored in Maren’s synesthetic bias; diction (“pleated air,” “slow emerald conquest”) is consistent and patterned early. Rhythm modulates from languid orchard sentences to the clipped final clause “something green and ancient began to grow,” mirroring the root’s stealth crossing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density—each sentence carries image, stakes, and forward motion. Figurative language is disciplined: only one metaphor per beat, none mixed. A single scaffold loop (“held breath / held its breath”) is cut cleanly by the final line break, so closure remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Color-bleed pruning and bilateral seed graft feel fresh, yet the “thin place between worlds” trope is familiar. Specificity of orchard craft and pigment-transfer technique lifts the piece above generic portal fantasy, but the scaffold is recognizable.</comment>
