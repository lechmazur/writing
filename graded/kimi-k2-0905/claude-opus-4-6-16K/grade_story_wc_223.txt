<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—her need to authenticate pain while fleeing proof, her surgical tenderness—are dramatized in every micro-choice (footfall spelling, rook move, notebook entry). The final renunciation of proving her own suffering is earned through the gallery’s echo confirming presence without witnesses. Interiority never slips into label-speak; even the vow is whispered, not exposited. Cost is felt: she stays in no-man’s-land, forever cataloguing the unnamed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren’s decision to STAY forecloses any future attempt to validate her own collapse, accepting perpetual exile in the “luminous absence.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each spelled word, object placement, and archived gesture thickens the pattern until the final footfall reweights the premise. No teleporting props; the missing pawns are因果地 tied to the hotel collapse and the missing “common people.” Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“elliptical chamber”) and never loosens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whispering gallery is not postcard scenery: its acoustic mirror supplies the only witness that ratifies Maren’s existence, shaping her choice to remain undocumented elsewhere. Chessboard, bench, and floor tiles function as micro-setting—every placement is tactile and choice-constraining. Light-persistence-after-bulb-dies becomes the exact metaphor for institutional interregnum and is later recharged in the final “luminous and absent” echo. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her curved path, bag set-down, rook move, notebook opening without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the unmourned micro-gesture vs. self-annihilating doubt—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when she replaces the missing pawn with a rook, admitting the powerful are powerless here. Pressure escalates by accrual: each spelled word, each harvested anecdote adds weight until the final STAY crystallizes her permanent forfeiture of personal vindication. No coincidence; the gallery’s echo is a given constraint, not a rescuer. Cost is visible—“she would spend her life” trying to preserve what no one else will—foreclosing alternative futures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation: the smaller the gesture, the larger the absence it measures. Subtext lives in the empty pawn squares—the unnamed vanish while dignitaries remain. The closing notebook entry and the S-T-A-Y steps offer a non-literal answer: history is not proven but performed, one breath-long hand on a wall at a time. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the echo returning her own breathing doubled, reconfiguring solitude into companionship with the vanished.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Maren’s perceptual filter—sound of shoes doubled, blanket folded in thirds, “nomadic penumbra” as self-diagnosis—without ever exceeding her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for accumulative grief, clipped fragments for the vow and the final spelling. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression (“luminous absence,” “benevolently ruthless”) is taught early and paid off in the last line’s glow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or cadence. Metaphors are controlled and mutually reinforcing—light after bulb, pawn-shaped void, echo as future self. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by echoed footfall that recharges every prior spelled word. Only minor filter verbs (“she understood the feeling”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Crisis-actor-turned-casualty angle is fresh, but the deeper ingenuity is using the whispering gallery’s acoustic property as the single witness that obviates external proof. Chessboard missing only pawns literalizes social erasure without speechifying. Risky second-person echo (“as though the building itself…”) is earned by acoustic science and pays off in the doubled-breath closure. Specificity makes the premise irreplicable: Ridgeline Hotel collapse, height-mark wall, three-fold blanket fold.</comment>
