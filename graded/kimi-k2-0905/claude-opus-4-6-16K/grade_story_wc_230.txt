<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s rationalist self-experimentation and involuntary truth-telling give her a sharp, consistent internal engine; the six-hour truffle trial on herself shows embodied cost. The final dosing decision is credibly earned by that prior burn. Minor slip: “psychological safety” flirts with label-speak, though it’s immediately grounded in the cave’s flinch-response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the glass eye becomes communal talisman and the truffle dose is measured—both carry felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each beat (find eye → confess → share → dose) deepens the stake of porous empathy. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The hanging orchard’s root-mesh and storm-battered cables function as micro-setting that literally supports the truffles and the dead-drop; the glass eye’s violet iris is re-filtered through grey storm-light at closure, reweighting the communal “approximate sight.” One tight environment constrains every tactical move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore emotional skin without losing compassion—tightens once: from solitary self-experiment to communal risk. The dose measurement is the visible price; the glass eye’s shift from contraband to shared talisman marks the deepening. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the eye’s transformation: fragility as shared prosthesis for a world that can no longer bear full sight. No moralizing; the final image of “approximate sight” reweights the empathy premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in Jonas’s quiet line charges the ending without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s rationalist perceptual filter—cataloguing, measuring, anchoring emotion in mortar and storm-light. Syntax is controlled and rhythmic; no head-hop. The single shard of dialogue (“It sees nothing…”) carries indirection and subtext, distinct from the narrative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“chest splitting open” is earned. Information density high: each sentence advances character, world, or stake. Zero artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus + truffle pharmacology + smuggled relic inside a glass eye is a fresh synthesis; the orchard-as-dead-drop turns a post-apocalyptic set-piece into a pharmacological heist of grace. Risk in the discredited-textbook cure pays off because the self-experiment grounds it. Transformation test: swap truffles for any generic macguffin and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
