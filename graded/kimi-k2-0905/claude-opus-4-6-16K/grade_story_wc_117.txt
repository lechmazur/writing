<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—professional patience versus maternal helplessness—are vividly embodied in the micro-choice to keep strumming while the sky vanishes, but the interiority edges into label-speak (“the ordinary magic she believed in”) and the final renunciation is cushioned rather than costly. Wren’s silence-break is credible, yet her agency is off-stage for two years; the locket hand-off reweights identity but feels like gift rather than price. Still, the mother-daughter crucible under eclipse pressure forces a visible status shift that alters their bond on the page.</comment>

<comment>The closure lands cleanly: Wren’s whispered “It’s still there” is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the locket, the heartbeat, and the returning light with undeniable emotional cost; the before/after is legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each open-tuned chord thickens atmosphere until silence itself becomes the decisive change. One hairline slip: “the mountain dreamed through them” is introduced late and not paid off, a faint register drift that nicks immediacy but does not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sage Ridge is anchored early, its limestone shelves and dreaming-root myth filtering Elara’s hopes; the eclipse timetable creates a live clock that tightens choice. The guitar’s open tuning and the locket’s glass act as micro-settings that constrain the final gesture—without them the coronal light has nothing to refract through. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: smell of milk remembered, temperature drop felt on skin, beetle dust observed through Wren’s tilted head. One minor drift: “locals said” is unattributed and slightly tour-guide, but the environment still charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—recovering Wren’s voice—tightens once: totality silences birds and guitar, forcing mother’s pulse to become the only rhythm left. The eclipse is coincidence that complicates, not resolves; the cost is the audible rasp of Wren’s first word and the visible fragility of the honey-brown curl in new light. A sharper tactical loss—Elara stops playing, relinquishing her therapist tool—would have pushed the band higher, but the moment still narrows options under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>“Ordinary magic” emerges from events, not sermon: the locket, the heartbeat, the returning light reconfigure meaning without moral coda. Subtext lives in gesture—ear pressed to pulse—rather than explanatory dialogue. The theme resists tidy cure: voice returns imperfectly, “quietly, imperfectly, wonderfully,” embracing ongoing ambiguity. Only a trace of sentimental abstraction—“the kind that lives in lullabies”—keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The narrator’s perceptual signature—gentle, acoustically tuned, sun-tracking—is distinct and stable; sentence rhythm modulates from long breathing cadences to the staccato of eclipse chill. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she liked it” mirrors therapist self-soothing). No head-hopping; Wren’s interior is inferred solely through body angle and whisper, maintaining POV modesty. A single lyrical overreach—“the mountain dreamed through them”—is the single hairline slip that prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “she hummed alongside silence until silence decided to hum back” compresses vocation and philosophy in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances sound, light, or breath. Metaphors are coherent—“corona blazed like a secret told in silver”—without crowding the beat. Only the phrase “therapy-speak” itself appears, but the actual interiority stays embodied, so the artifact is avoided.</comment>

<comment>Fresh angle: music therapist mother + elective eclipse pilgrimage + child-selective-mutism, synthesizing familiar parental-recovery arc through acoustic rather than medical logic. The honey-brown curl as acoustic lens is specific to this voice; removing it collapses the final refraction. Risk is moderate—eclipse as catalyst could feel contrived, but the story commits fully, letting ordinary magic feel earned rather than gimmick. Still, the premise is not radically non-obvious, keeping it shy of 8.8+.</comment>
