<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren’s “listening to walls” trait is vividly embodied in the opening beats and drives every on-page action; the interior contradiction between scholarly rigor and mystical belief is felt but never crystallizes into a costly micro-choice that forecloses a path, so the arc plateaus rather than turns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the silo wall “waiting for the next odd historian” reweights the entire premise—history’s center is the act of listening, not the artifact—and the cost (perpetual, lonely vigil) is unmistakable; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sentence to last, though the orientation of time/place is slightly late (~140 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silo’s cylindrical shelves, bronze quiet, and wind-pressed curvature are returned at closure to charge the final image; the half-burned diary pages function as micro-setting that constrains how Maren can read, satisfying the 9+ gate; selective sensory detail (brittle wasp-wing pages, gold thread vibration) is filtered through Maren’s perceptual bias without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost human memory after dreaming ends—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when Maren realizes the tapestry’s displaced axis reframes her life’s work, but the escalation is observational rather than causal; no visible price is exacted on Maren in this beat, so the tension intensifies conceptually, not practically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: history’s true center is the listener, not the event; the final silo image reframes Elda’s tapestry and Maren’s vocation into one continuous, non-literal answer; no moral is stated, and the ambiguity between wall-memory and human forgetting lingers with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The third-person lyric voice sustains a distinctive rhythmic cadence (“bronze quiet,” “rifle barrel” spiral) that modulates into hush at closure; perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices texture, silence, and axial asymmetry; no head-hop or register drift; elisions (“the well had gone dry”) are taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled and varied; sentences perform double duty (description + concept); no paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent (“mortar held memory the way amber held insects”); zero artifacts in peak or closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “post-dream” frame and wall-listening historian synthesize into a fresh angle on extinction-of-imagination tropes; the displaced-axis metaphor is particularized through tapestry handling and re-enters the final silo image, making the turn feel inevitable; risk in the lyric accumulative structure is rewarded by coherent closure.</comment>
