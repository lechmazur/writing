<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera’s marrow-deep pacifism is dramatized through embodied micro-choices: kneeling, burying, offering tea, quietly redirecting the militia boy’s knife. The final refusal to cut—”Nothing here needs cutting”—crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost (the tower is gone, the world may soon need weapons she won’t provide). Contradictory impulses (grief vs. composure, heritage vs. renunciation) run simultaneously in scene, never summarized. The airship scrap burial fuses memory, weight, and filial benediction in one gesture that forecloses her father’s path of violence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (roses absorb stories) and deepens density through iterative whispered virtues until the final cadence reweights the stake—continuity survives collapse. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dome becomes a lantern of Charged Poise, world dark, her grammar of care still legible. Persistent constraint: she will not arm anyone, even as order disintegrates; cost is felt in the militia boy’s weeping and the tower’s absence. Orientation, causality, and micro-turns (knife offered → knife sheathed) cohere without lapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: it holds roses, refugees, and sound, forcing Sera’s ethic of stillness into visible relief. Desert flats, salt glare, and lantern-amber light are filtered through her pacifist attention—she notices petal curl before shockwave. Spatial choreography stays clean across arrivals, sleeping rows, and the toolshed trip. The oldest rose bush as final anchor recharges the buried scrap and the value “persistence,” fusing tool, body, and soil into one charged image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can continuity survive administrative collapse?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when survivors arrive. One meaningful deepening: the militia boy’s request forces Sera to expose her only blade, then renounce its use, narrowing options under accumulative pressure. Visible price: the tower’s fall (external) and her father’s violent lineage (internal) both press against her refusal, leaving the boy disarmed and weeping. No reversal is needed; the stance crystallizes with undeniable social cost: she will not fight for order, only garden it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative action: burying ballast scrap = planting weight of violence as compost for mercy. Subtext lives in gesture—knife returned to sheath, roses fed words instead of blood—never in exposition. Final image (“root by root, word by word”) offers a non-literal answer: grammar of care can outlast steel towers. No moralizing, only embodied irony that the bounty hunter’s heir survives by refusing the hunt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Sera’s perceptual signature: she clocks petal tremor, hand tremor, grief behind bluster. Syntax slows to stillness—long vowels, sibilants—mirroring her marrow pacifism. No head-hopping; militia boy’s interior is inferred only through external cues she can see. Voice modulates under amber light, late sun, final lantern glow without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: high density, zero loops, varied rhythm, no mixed metaphors. One hairline slip—“tranquil blaze” borders oxymoron, but context justifies it as intentional paradox. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges roses/grammar motif. No scaffolding, no template cadence, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: pacifist horticulture as counter-infrastructure post-collapse. Roses-as-memory-banks feels inevitable yet unmined. Risk: lyrical repetition could fatigue, but cadence tightens toward lantern closure instead. Not derivative; could not swap names/places without breaking root-by-root ethic.</comment>
