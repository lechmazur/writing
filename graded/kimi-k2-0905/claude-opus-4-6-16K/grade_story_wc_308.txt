<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—stillness accumulates into a credible renunciation. The micro-choice to sit, strike, and watch birds crystallizes a hierarchy of values (knowledge over motion) with visible cost: weeks of immobility, dust, ache. Contradictory impulses—hunger for the pulse vs. acceptance of its passage—coexist in the final beat without tidy resolution. One slip: “she was exactly where she needed to be” edges toward label closure; still, prior causality supports the stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral pulse passes through her, reconfiguring inner cartography without external change. Cost is legible in body and time—forty-three days of stillness, dust, swallowed motion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of strike–watch–wait tightens until the bird-compass final image. No orientation debt; canyon rules taught early and paid off in the resonance map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, dust layers, and bird-flight columns function as both architecture and instrument—every detail constrains listening tactics. Arrowhead’s mineral match to canyon walls makes it irreplaceable; its vibration re-tunes space. Sensory hierarchy obeys stillness ethic: sound and kinaesthesia outweigh vision. Final image of feather compass could not exist without prior spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the wandering pulse—tightens via iterative listening trials; each strike narrows possibilities. Mid-story pattern break (birds as spectrograph) escalates method, not just repetition. Cost accumulates: immobility, fasting, social erasure. No external antagonist needed; pressure is acoustic and existential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge through surrender—emerges from acoustic metaphors rather than assertion. Spiral orbit of the pulse reweights earlier “navigation without moving” premise: stillness becomes locomotion in time. Final letting-go reframes pursuit as reception. No moralizing; resonance lingers in feather ring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a hushed, mineral cadence that mimics canyon echo. Compression (“She struck. Listened.”) mirrors arrowhead’s percussion. Perceptual signature is sound-first, time-dilated, skin-level. No head-hop; diction stays within skimmer’s mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length to mimic pulse/echo rhythm; no template cadence. Figurative density peaks only at the final feather compass, earning its lyric swell. Information dual-loads: “dust of centuries pressing soft beneath her” fuses tactile and temporal. One near-loop—“struck and watched” repeated—kept from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the trope of desert mystic into acoustic cartographer; bird-flock as sonograph feels inevitable yet fresh. Conceptual risk—story resolved by abstention—pays off because prior beats ritualize stillness. Bone-tower sonar marries paleontology with navigation, a synthesis not seen in stock speculative canon. Final image could not be transplanted without collapsing premise.</comment>
