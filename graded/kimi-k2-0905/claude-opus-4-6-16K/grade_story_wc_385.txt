<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s contradiction—need to know why some names vanish vs. her own complicity in severing ties—is dramatized in the final sung test; interiority stays concrete (“the melancholy did not leave her. It never would”). Father’s absence functions as lived history, not label. Micro-choice at the nexus (singing her own name) crystallizes values with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the echo is the web, not the soul, reweighting every prior silence. Causal chain holds: gift of shell → nexus revelation → renarration of vocation. The blind cartographer beat briefly risks orientational fuzziness but pays off in shell use. Cost is legible on-page—her own name returns braided with external voices, commitment made visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Red-rock canyons, night-cooled sandstone, and the cracked nacre constrain footfall and auditory payoff; the “reed-blown note” image recharges the final melancholy. Sensory triangulation (wind over stone, vibration in sternum) filters through Maren’s ear-trained bias. Spatial choreography stays clean in single POV trek. Micro-setting (seashell) functions as setting and final constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why some vanish—tightens when the shell reveals relational severance as the hidden rule; her own sung test narrows future options from passive inquiry to active guardianship of “tethers.” Escalation is conceptual rather than external, fitting Accumulative lens. One deepening suffices: the web replaces the individual as unit of resonance. Cost is felt in the thinning melancholy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of relational tethering emerges inductively from the shell’s disclosure, never sermonized. Final image (“almost transparent, almost light”) reweights grief without moral. Subtext in returned harmonics lets prior clients’ unnamed losses echo. Avoids tidy maxim; silence keeps ambiguity generative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature attuned to acoustic nuance—“vowels thickened by grief,” consonants landing “half-breath too late.” Syntax breathes with canyon pauses; no head-hop. Lexicon stays within desert folk idiom. No dialogue, so voice carries full melodic load.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence moves premise or stakes. Figurative control consistent—“threads” motif builds to web reveal. Occasional elevated diction (“iridescent under lamplight”) reads as Maren’s aesthetic training and remains brief. Rhythm modulates from long desert sentences to clipped final line, ear-tested aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Echo-as-relational-web reorients a familiar trope of speaking to stones; synthesis feels inevitable post-reveal. Seashell-as-diagnostic-tool, cartographer-by-touch, and star-unfamiliar constellations combine into singular folk-SW mythos. Melancholy thinned to “almost light” offers fresh emotional valence. Risk in conceptual resolution pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
