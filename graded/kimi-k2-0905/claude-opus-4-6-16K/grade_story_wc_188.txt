<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s defiance-as-fuel is viscerally embodied—from sulfur-scented poverty to scrubbing glaze with a kerosene rag—and her micro-choices (copying the formula on her own skin) crystallize the stakes with felt cost. Interior contradiction flickers in “serious delight,” but the arc lands as earned endurance: she forecloses retreat and carries the invented stars forward. No stock therapy-speak; every beat roots in sensory labor. The only restraint from 9+ is that no second on-page character tests her status, so relational crucible remains theoretical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the starless night is reweighted into “canvas waiting” and the protagonist exits with a persistent constraint—flesh-grafted formula plus sulfur poverty—making the new weight undeniable. Accumulative-lens pattern (fragments → mosaic → cadence) is taught by 25 % and holds to last line. Orientation anchored by word 70; no teleporting props. One paraphrase loop (“perpetually…” triad) costs the final 0.1.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fortress-courtyard operates as tool-setting: wisteria scent thickens air into a filtering medium, forcing Maren to hunt “geometric interruption” beneath sweetness—an environmental gate that directly shapes her search method. Spatial choreography is exact (fingers on vine → tile → rag-scrub circles); no floating rooms. Micro-object kerosene knot supplies mineral tang and later charges final image. One decorative perfume line could be cut, but nothing breaks causal clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—manufacture light against starless despair—tightens once: finding the mosaic recipe collapses the option to leave empty-handed and visibly costs her forearm skin as notebook. Accumulative escalation is sufficient: density of scent → revealed tile → copied ratios, each layer raising stakes without external antagonist. No extra reversal needed at this length. The price (future experimental burns implied) is legible on-page, meeting 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the praxis of hope: spectacle is not frivolity but insurgent light-making. The closing image—“she carried her own stars”—reweights every prior “gravity of hopelessness” without moralizing. Recurring chant and rag accumulate meaning through use; no late-symbol graft. Subtext in “fire is a conversation” reframes pyrotechnics as resistance dialogue. Complexity intact: poverty remains, failure likely, yet stance crystallized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight internal to Maren; perceptual signature filters world through combustion chemistry and itinerant syllable-hoarding. Syntax mirrors her gait—percussive, additive, rhythmic—without drumbeat monotony. Figurative range (“soft ammunition,” “serious playfulness”) stays within artisan lexicon. No head-hop, filter-stack, or register drift; compression in final paragraph is taught pattern paying off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. High information density—each line advancing scent, tool, or formula. One triplet of “perpetually” creates mild scaffold but does not touch closure. Metaphors are coherent (petals as ammunition, darkness as canvas). No synonym loops, purple overload, or passive stacks. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Risk-taking in lyric-accumulative structure pays off: fireworks recipe conveyed as mosaic ratios felt fresh and inevitable. Tropes—wandering artist, starless night—are alchemized through sensory labor and defiant chemistry. Voice, world, and theme cohere into singular stance. Final reprise of chant converts recycled fragments into emergent constellation. No derivative-template echo; specificity makes removal impossible without collapsing arc.</comment>
