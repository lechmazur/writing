<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s sleep-starved monomania is rendered through tactile micro-choices—threading sinew, refusing coffee—that externalize her fraying inner architecture. The contradictions of “unsettling calm” and “realistically imaginary” are lived in body and decision, not labels. Jun functions as a minimal but effective mirror: his one intrusion literally transfers tension into the web, making relationship a physical stakes-test. Cost is felt when she weeps under the completed lattice: endurance cracks without therapeutic self-explanation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (sinew lattice + illusions) mounts until it crystallizes into Charged Poise—“the room breathed.” Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and hold. The single deepening beat—Jun entering the web—redistributes physical tension and reweights the stake from private obsession to shared visceral knowledge. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the gallery now lives, and Maren’s memory is already liquefying; no path is reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escher Wing’s impossible geometry is not tourist scenery but a force that dictates tool choice (sinew) and bodily risk (barefoot center). Selective sensory triage—translucent tendon fiber, “grain and give” of tension—mirrors Maren’s narrowed attention under exhaustion. Spatial choreography stays coherent: Jun steps in, threads redistribute, viewers later feel unseen restraint. The micro-setting of the web itself functions as mutable terrain that finally cradles/entraps both maker and witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the built lattice externalize connection?”—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each stitched strand raises material density and cognitive blur. The single decisive turn: Jun’s intrusion transfers live weight into the structure, forcing it to accommodate human presence and completing Maren’s test. Cost is legible: memory sequence erodes, and the gallery’s autonomous respiration implies perpetual caretaking debt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—perception versus material tether—emerges through iterative acts of weaving and viewing, never sloganized. The sinew literalizes invisible relational tissue; the gallery’s “breathing” reframes art as parasitic symbiosis. Subtextual ache arrives when visitors mistake calm for safety, unaware they’re suspended in fish-gut ligaments. Final image of “almost understood” offers conceptual repricing: knowledge is proximate yet fugitive, a cost Maren consents to endure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual warp: cod-tendon compared to neural filaments, exhaustion rendering time viscous. Syntax lengthens then compresses to mimic hallucinatory vigil. Jun’s single line of dialogue is utilitarian, foregrounding Maren’s refusal without voice-bleed. No head-hopping; focalization remains anchored until the balcony coda widens to spectator mode, a controlled cinematic pullback.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; mixed-length sentences avoid drumbeat. Figurative layering (“gallery had begun to breathe”) is sparing and prepared by earlier personification cues. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Minor scaffold: “realistically imaginary, structurally sound but perceptually impossible” could compress, but the triplet serves as manifesto and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Leveraging cod-sinew as sculptural medium fuses biology with architecture in a way that feels both inevitable and unexampled. The premise “rational enchantment” stakes its claim early and refuses to retreat into metaphor; the built object must actually stand and tense under load. Familiar Escher tropes are revitalized by haptic consequence: illusion becomes snare. The final intimation that connection is tactile yet ungraspable offers fresh emotional ontology rather than clever twist.</comment>
