<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vela’s interior contradiction—trading mirrors for dreams—grounds every action; the climactic “she had not trapped the dream. She had become the surface” crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost. Embodied micro-choices (breath-sync, calibrating mirrors to fog-angles) keep motive alive in scene. No contradictory impulses play simultaneously inside a beat, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the arc is coherent and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the boundary dissolution lands on-page (“she had erased the boundary…”) and carries conceptual cost—she forfeits observer distance forever. Accumulative lens holds: each mirrored fragment adds density until breath-sync pattern breaks the frame. Causality is intact; no Orientation debt; one smooth transition (workshop → frost field) taught early. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog-as-setting actively bends light and tactics; frost-crystals become the micro-setting that gates the final capture. Specificity is selective—calcified trees, copper vats, frost-needles—never tourist-catalog. Tool (sextant) and environment together constrain the angle-of-capture choice and charge the final image. All 9+ gates met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—tightens through each calibration session; final breath-sync forecloses any future attempt (Earned Stasis with cost). Agency drives every escalation; frost-timing is exploited, not coincidental. One meaningful deepening sufficed; persistent constraint (she is now the mirror-surface) visible in closing image. Pressure legible throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasing observer–observed boundary emerges via mirrored specifics, never moralizing. Final image reweights earlier orchard-memory without stating a thesis. Subtext in “glass mountains rising from nothing” fuses beauty and terror. Ambiguity lingers: restoration possible only by self-dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—light angles, mirror craft—colours every observation. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for fog, staccato for frost-crystals under climax. No head-hop; diction stays within Vela’s artisan lexicon. Pattern-taught elision (“like frozen songs”) pays off in closing upward-snow image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere); no filter-verb stacks or loops. Mixed metaphors (“dream…as though it had legs”) are brief and voice-motivated. Frost paragraph achieves high density without purple overload. Final line “apple blossoms drifted like snow falling upward” lands clean, recharging prior frost motif. Minor scaffolding in orchard-history sentence, but nothing touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astrolabe principle inverted to collapse terrestrial boundaries, not measure celestial ones. Fog-orchard and mirror-craft interlock organically; sextant resurrection grows from stated expertise. Risk-taking (lyric escalation, breath-as-tuning) sharpens stakes without clarity loss. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
