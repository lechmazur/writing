<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s blank-face resistance is vividly embodied through the micro-choice of adding a wooden flower; the narrator’s self-aware narration exposes contradictory impulses without lapsing into therapy-speak. Cost is felt: each silent petal is an illicit memory kept against law, and the final refusal to speak crystallizes her stake. Still, emotional progression is almost too perfectly calibrated—every beat doubles as thesis—so she edges toward archetype rather than fully flawed person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the wooden petal additions tighten the pattern until the final silence reweights the “remade hush” with undeniable conceptual cost—an Earned Stasis that forecloses public grief forever. Causality is interior but traceable: because narration keeps her safe, therefore she risks one carved flower, which in turn finalizes her mute stance. No orientation debt; space/time anchor within 120 w.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Turbines, pine curls, and brittle bouquet are selectively filtered through Maren’s performer gaze; each recurs to constrain her illicit act of making. The turbines’ sweeping shadow literally times her carving beats, integrating macro setting into micro action. However, farmhouse layout remains sketch—no clear sight-lines between porch and kitchen—so spatial coherence drops from perfect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk visible mourning?—tightens once: first petal carved → threat of social contagion charge → final silent placement. Agency is present, cost legible (every shaving could betray her), but escalation is single-cycle; no second reversal or deeper price beyond existing fines. Still, the pattern intensifies adequately under accretive lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of performative obedience becoming private resistance emerges organically from recurring images—blank face / wooden bloom / mandated smile—without moralizing. Final silence reprises the opening turbine gods, conceptually repricing joy-as-law as hollow. Subtext in withheld tears is strong, but thematic statement risks overtness in lines like “obedience ended and sabotage began.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; free-indirect blends with Maren’s theatrical idiom (“the performer enters…”) to create a distinct rhythmic signature. Pattern is taught early and paid off when narration finally ceases. No head-hopping; turbine shadow and carving cadence match syntactic ebb/flow. Minor register lift toward “conceptual repricing” academic diction nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from long, breathy descriptive lines to staccato narration beats, mirroring the slow-turning turbines. Dense, dual-purpose lines (“the hush that grew back thicker…”) propel without scaffolding. Metaphors stay coherent; only rare near-repeats (“something else… something almost bearable”) create faint echo. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing dystopian affect policing with solitary folk-art defiance feels fresh; wooden surrogate flowers as contraband memory is an indelible image. Concept follows through—no late rule cheats—and emotional truth grounds the speculative frame. The risk of self-conscious literariness (“slow, white gods”) slightly dulls surprise, keeping it just below top-tier originality.</comment>
