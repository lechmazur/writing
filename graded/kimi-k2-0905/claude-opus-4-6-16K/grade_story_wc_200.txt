<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and interior contradiction (listening without fixing) stay vivid; embodied grief-laughter micro-choices drive the beat. Croc-tooth warmth gives tactile cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation of perfection lands with felt weight—earned stasis visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: gorge-echo density increases until sunrise reweights meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) nailed by word 30; closure a CR—sunlight makes “luminous ache” undeniable, cost charged in the tooth and the deliberate discord. One smooth scene, no teleport. Closure unit clean with conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo gorge rules taught early and constrain tactics: mis-tuned harp exploits feedback, sunrise clock alters visibility. Micro-setting (tooth, harp neck) physically handled and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy filters through Maren’s listening bias. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across flat stone to canyon wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the stuck soul—signaled in para 2. Tightening occurs when laughter is woven into dissonance, foreclosing pure-grief option; cost legible in warming tooth. Agency sits with Maren’s musical choices; coincidence absent. One meaningful cadence shift sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief incomplete without joy—emerges through echo-harp alchemy, never stated. Subtext in spectral joke vs. unspoken pride. Final sunrise image reweights prior dissonance without moralizing. Particulars resist tidy binary; ambiguity lingers as echo fades.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to auditory and tactile. Rhythm mimics breathing cadence under canyon echo. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Compressed lyric diction taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or character. Figurative language densely packed but patterned—water/echo/breath motif holds. No mixed metaphors. Strong verbs propel motion. Final line varies sentence length to create release cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar afterlife trope inverted: collector engineers joy而非absolution. Mis-tuned harp as necromantic tool feels inevitable, not gimmick. Specificity of croc-tooth talisman and sunrise timing fresh. Risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without clarity loss.</comment>
