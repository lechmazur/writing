<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The interior contradiction between Maren’s perfect memory and the unfinished portrait is dramatized in-scene; the micro-choice to finish the smile costs her three years of avoidance and re-opens the creative vein with embodied trembling. Charcoal-stained fingers, the hospital-room recall, and the cave-floor decision all manifest the same flaw: she can preserve every line except the one that matters. The final smile lands as Earned Stasis—creative flow restored, but only by accepting perpetual remembrance of loss. No diagnostic label-speak; all emotion is corporealized through grip, breath, and stone-reflected light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the broken lock, the lie of an “unfinished” memory, and the amber crystals accumulate until the last stroke reweights the premise—she will draw again, darkness acknowledged. Closure is Charged Poise: the portrait crowned in crystal fire crystallizes the new equilibrium with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; time/place remain stable; no causal gaps. The final image makes the price (permanent remembrance of disappearance) legible without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The selenite columns and lantern-fractured rainbows are filtered through Maren’s artist-eye; every visual note mirrors the act of sketching light on paper. The cave’s amber glow literally crowns the finished portrait, charging the final image. Spatial choreography holds as she sits cross-legged, lantern beside her, paper on knees—no floating objects. One micro-setting lapse: no tactile cold or damp, but the visual constraint dominates choice, so the cap is not triggered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she finish the portrait and resume drawing?—is signaled in paragraph four. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: memory lies, box breached, cave silence, then the first charcoal whisper. The decisive tightening occurs when the mouth resolves into sunrise-between smile; this forecloses pure avoidance forever. Cost is visible: she trades numb safety for creative flow soaked in grief—an irreversible stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between perfect retention and necessary completion: remembrance is not preservation but ongoing creation. The crystals’ growth in darkness reconfigures the premise—suppression does not stop art, it merely distorts memory. No moralizing; the final smile is a non-literal answer to whether forgetting is mercy. Subtext of “disappearing while being drawn” reverberates without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: geological timelines recited for tourists, charcoal grip recalled in muscle, hospital smell of cut roses. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short strokes while drawing—rhythmic mimicry of sketching. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon (“frozen dawn,” “dislocated jaw”). Filter verbs serve voice: “she felt the familiar ache” is immediate, not distancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors are purposeful—“crowns her mother’s likeness in pale fire”—and cohere around light/refraction. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges crystals-darkness motif. High information density without overwriting: “architecture of leaving” compresses mortality and art in three words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mnemonic hyperthymesia paired with unfinished portrait is fresh; caves as creative womb reverses typical descent-into-madness trope. The broken lock as time’s trespass rather than human villain feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have collapsed into vignette, but crystal crown image pays off pattern. Slight proximity to “artist blocked by grief” template holds score below 9.0.</comment>
