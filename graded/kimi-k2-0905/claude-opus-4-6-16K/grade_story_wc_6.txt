<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—firefighter lineage versus arsonist father—are dramatized in every tactile choice: kneeling at black water, binding cambium to cambium, coin against pulse. Her interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “the scars could sing” arrives through bodily ritual, not abstraction. The final earned stasis—spring return uncertain, grafts unguaranteed—carries visible cost: she forecloses vengeance, chooses waiting. Voice never slips into therapy-speak; silence is a language she speaks fluently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: black sand, coin, grafts accrete meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is Charged Poise—lagoon holds everything, asks nothing—cost felt in coin’s warmth and spring’s uncertainty. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Micro-turn: grafting smoke-tree cuttings onto manzanita is the single tightening that forecloses rage and chooses patient stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting: its black mirror surface literally reflects her fingers, coin, sky, forcing her to confront composite identity. Volcanic glass ledges constrain physical movement—kneeling, binding—while tidal vein pulses external time. Smoke-tree bark texture and salt air narrow sensory field to wound/heal duality. Final image of clouds migrating south reweights setting as clock: she must return, environment demands accountability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens once: grafting wounded branches onto living rootstock externalizes internal conflict. No antagonist needed; pressure is time + memory. Visible cost: she risks failure (no take) and accepts indefinite return, foreclosing instant catharsis. Escalation is situational: quiet ritual intensifies through tactile repetition until stance crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from graft theology: join wounded to living, wait. No moral stated; resonance lives in final image—lagoon holding everything, asking nothing—repricing loss as ongoing stewardship. Subtext operates in silence: father’s unexplained coin becomes covenant. Emotional aftereffect is hush of tidal pulse and pending spring, not sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight inside Maren’s perceptual filter: “clouds migrating like herds,” “silence its own language.” Syntax lengthens during calm, shortens under tactile pressure (“She breathed in salt air”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction matching firefighter precision: “cambium to cambium,” “leeward slope.” Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“looked like a wound”) not excessive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening long sentence mirrors wrong-trail drift; later fragments echo heartbeat against coin. Figurative layers (kelp, watershed, mirror) stay coherent under pressure. Only minor scaffold: “the whole theology” could compress, but it lands as credo, not filler. No loops or mixed metaphors; closure line breathes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle: arsonist’s daughter becomes firefighter who heals with horticulture, not heroics. Graft-as-ritual transforms familiar trauma plot into vegetal patience. Coin-on-thread avoids sentimental talisman by remaining unexplained. Specificity—Chetco Bar fire, Punaluu black sand—roots universals in verifiable place. Risk is quietness; coherence justifies the gamble.</comment>
