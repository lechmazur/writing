<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her shallow breathing, the vial warming against her hip, the sudden weeping—each micro-choice anchored to the memory-weaponised scent. The final act of uncapping/capping the vial dramatises her contradictory impulses: to drown in grief versus survive it. The cost is visceral and irreversible, earned by the prior eleven-year embargo she places on herself. Only the “wistful” label drifts toward shorthand, trimming the top tenth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward memory shifts from guarded to porous, then sealed again with new knowledge that the cost is bearable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent-images layer until the cadence cracks open in the UV chamber. Every beat is tethered to the vial or the dying bloom, so causality feels fated rather than contrived. Orientation is immediate; spatial and temporal anchors hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered through selective sensory hierarchy—climate-controlled humidity, refracted UV lattice on skin, the faint fluorescence of perfume—each detail filtering Elara’s dread. The UV chamber functions as micro-setting that literally illuminates hidden vasculature, mirroring the emotional “mapping” she undergoes. The Franklin tree’s knotted silver bark and single bloom are economically foregrounded to charge the final image. Environment, tool (vial), and body interlock to constrain her decision to inhale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she survive direct contact with memory—tightens when Dr. Lien announces “this final flowering… goodbye,” converting the bloom into a live countdown. The pressure is situational: no antagonist, but the irrevocable wilt of the plant and the irreversible release of scent force her stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs the instant she uncaps; no further reversals are needed at this length. The cost is legible on the wrist-trace that “would always be enough,” foreclosing future denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: remembrance as both wound and lifeline, scent as time’s ungovernable conduit. The Franklinia perfume is never allowed to stand for “memory” in abstract—it is white petals, honey warmth, the hollow of her mother’s throat. Subtextual weight accrues through silence: Dr. Lien’s quiet exposition, the absence of any plea for preservation grants Elara privacy to choose surrender. Final image reweights earlier caution into charged poise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual signature—olfactory vigilance, lantern-light color memory, the synesthetic “smell of safety.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during reflection, then fractures into shorter units under the UV assault (“She wept. She let herself grieve…”). No dialogue, so voice purity remains uncontested. The prose’s hushed cadence itself feels “aromatically cautious” until the uncapping rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density without clutter—“crystal shadows fell… on her hands, on the vial” performs triple duty (image, foreshadow, tactile link). Metaphors are spare and botanical, never competing with the central perfume vehicle. Zero loops or paraphrase detected. A solitary elevated phrase—“memory completed its long transformation”—is earned by context and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The extinct-plant conservatory as theatre for olfactory grief feels fresh, yet grounded in real-world conservation science. Linking UV revelation to emotional exposure offers a non-obvious synthesis that intensifies stakes rather than decorating them. Risk is taken in quiet climax—no theft, no rescue, only voluntary sorrow—and the gamble pays off in irreplaceable specificity. Minor half-point deduction because “lantern broker” remains an off-stage credential rather than a lived texture here.</comment>
