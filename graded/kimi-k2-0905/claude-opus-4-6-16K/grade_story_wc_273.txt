<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable’s refusal to blink first, her deliberate ink-spill, and the final hand-clasp embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the drone-built solitude and wind-scoured camp act as crucibles that force her to pay with literal dissolution. Interiority stays concrete—“holding a scream between her teeth,” “anger be the anchor”—and the cost of reappearance is left as felt residue on the sandstone. The sister-motive is never abstracted into therapy-speak; it drives every micro-choice. Minor slip: competence (squid-melanin synthesis, hand-soldered circuits) edges toward too neat but is balanced by genuine bodily risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: because Maren vanished through ink + eclipse → therefore Sable replicates conditions → therefore she arrives, not disappears. The ink-pool spiral is the taught constraint that later pays off as the door; time-thickening is the persistent price that shapes tactics (drone slowed to visible strokes). Closure is the Decisive Change: two women stand where one did—undeniable conceptual cost. No teleporting props; every reagent (drone, vial, wind-carved table) is planted early.</comment>

<comment>The wind-carved sandstone camp functions as micro-setting: it refuses domestication, mirrors Sable’s internal wildness, and literally erases structures—its patient carving parallels the ink’s vanishing, charging the final clean slab. Squid-melanin ink and 80-beat drone wings supply tactile specificity that constrains method. Spatial choreography is immaculate: drone lifts, hovers, slows; Sable’s hand flattens, dissolves, re-solidifies clutching Maren. One hairline slip—“temporal-reactive polymers” drifts toward technobabble, but the POV is a tracker-inventor, so lexicon passes.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Maren—locks in paragraph five and escalates through ink geometry that forecloses retreat: each spill risks permanent self-erasure. Agency is renunciation-crystallization: Sable lets time scream to a halt rather than fight it, paying with bodily dissolution. The tightening beat is the spiral aligning; cost is the drone’s amber-stroke vision and her wrist vanishing into script. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her calibrated repetition of the fatal experiment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as repeatable physics—emerges through the ink’s behavior, not statement. Totality’s chill and wind-carved erasure braid nature’s indifference with human refusal, producing a conceptual repricing: love can bend time if paid with flesh. Subtext lives in the drone’s silent recording and the unspoken sister-handclasp. No moralizing; the final image of clean sandstone reweights the prior stains as evidence, not message.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “iridescent wings blurring at eighty beats per second” slides into visceral metaphor—“time screamed to a halt.” Perceptual signature is tracker-cold: color-noted albinism, wind-gauged distances, refusal to blink. Compression taught early—“ink already dying”—justifies later ellipsis. No head-hopping; drone remains tool, not narrator. Rhythm modulates from observational precision to slowed-time bass vibration without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; no scaffold. Sentence openings vary; high density in “ink climbed her wrist in vanishing script.” Metaphors are coherent: wind as patient sculptor, time as resin—both sustained without mixed logic. One near-purple phrase “ghost of totality’s chill” is earned by POV lyricism. Final line lands with imagistic snap, recharging “retreating shadow” motif from opener.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eclipse + squid-ink + temporal polymer = measurable door; sister-retrieval via calligraphic dissolution feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk—lyric physics that could collapse into hand-wave—paid off by drone data and on-page bodily cost. Wildness-as-setting and erosion-as-time are not quirky ornament but structural. Transformation test: swap ink for paint or drone for camera and the whole arc fractures.</comment>
