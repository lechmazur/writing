<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her fingers “found the parachute buckle in the dark” without sight, anchoring her watcher's discipline. The contradictory impulses—report vs. protect Cassin—collide in the radio beat, embodied in her trembling hands after the call. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she risks Command’s wrath to phrase the log with surgical neutrality. Cost is felt: the shaking hands after releasing the buckle register the price of that precision.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: static ➔ anomalous signal ➔ revised report ➔ runner-not-strike decision. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren reframes the anomaly as “equipment malfunction / duress,” foreclosing a lethal option. Closure is a Charged Poise: “She waited for the next pattern,” stance crystallized, cost legible in the tremor. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by 40 words: “Maren’s fingers… Great Ash… seven weeks ago.”</comment>

<comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is not backdrop; it dictates her isolation and the optical clarity required for pattern detection. Micro-setting—the cold buckle against her palm—functions as tactile grounding and threat (escape route). Cloud layer and star clarity mirror her double solitude between two silences. Spatial choreography is clean: she sits, writes, radios, releases buckle—each object tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust without bloodshed—announced early and tested by the counterfeit signal. Escalation is the shift from passive logging to active wording that redirects violence; the runner-not-team outcome proves the narrowing worked. Cost is the trembling hands and the perpetual vigil she must resume. Agency is her linguistic pivot, not external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of surveillance ethics emerges from her concrete choice, not slogans. The final image—“only one who sat between those two silences”—reweights the opening buckle as both lifeline and burden, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in the radio silence implies systemic fragility without exposition. No moralizing sentence; resonance arises from the poise she accepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific: “midnight pattern seeker” idiom, star mercilessness, cloud-roar of radio static. Rhythm modulates—staccato clicks of buckle vs. lyrical final paragraph—mirroring vigilance fatigue. No dialogue contamination; Dahl’s voice arrives only as clipped disembodied transmitter, maintaining distance. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly within Maren’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual breaths. Information density high: “white roar that matched the clouds below” does triple sensory duty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Metaphors (clouds as frozen ocean) stay physically coherent. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve via the same tactile object, giving circular propulsion without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Conceit of an aerial watcher decoding lantern lies feels fresh, not standard dystopia. The parachute buckle reappears as both逃生 tool and ethical ballast, transforming its utilitarian identity. Risk taken: almost entire story is static vigil yet pressure sustains via linguistic decision. Specificity of “nocturnal arbor” and “signal cadence forgery” resists generic rebel-radio trope.</comment>
