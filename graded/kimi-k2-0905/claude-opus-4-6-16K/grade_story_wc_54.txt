<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable’s curiosity and “functionally creative” bent are shown through tactile mapping of carnival kludges; her interiority stays concrete. She endures bureaucratic maze‐cost (stoic presentation, withheld smile) that visibly forecloses instant victory. The brass sextant anchors her hierarchy of values—memory over demolition—yet the board’s vote is off-stage, muting the felt personal price at the final beat. Still, contradictory drives (pragmatic engineer vs. utopian dreamer) coexist in-scene, earning the feasibility‐study advance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: approval of a study, not demolition, with the sextant’s inscription re-weighted as her first coordinate—conceptual cost is legible. Causal chain (carnival reroutes → intern documents → board opens corridor) holds; no teleporting information. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3 and never wavers. One minor slack: the actual vote occurs in gap-time, slightly softening the decisive-change punch, but the corridor’s opening still lands on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Terminal is rendered through lived traversal—echoing boots, skylight soil maths, dry fountain basins—selective and POV-filtered. The sextant as micro-setting constrains her choice to keep and photograph it, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: power lines, drainage channels, brass fragment all track. Weather and large-scale geography stay off-stage, appropriate for this interior arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save terminal vs. raze it—surfaces early and tightens once: feasibility study granted, demolition deferred. Protagonist agency is visible in mapping, silent presentation; cost is the postponed “yes” and continued maze-of-bureaucracy. No reversal or additional twist, but one meaningful narrowing is sufficient for 600–800 words. Stakes stay personal and concrete rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “intention as first coordinate” emerges through brass object, water-redirect blueprints, and her stoic pitch—no explicit sermon. Subtextual irony: carnival’s parasitic hacks become the colony’s seed of rebirth. Ambiguity remains—study is not victory—creating honest complexity. Final image of inscription facing up gives non-literal resonance that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice carries restrained lyricism suited to stoic wonder: “equations forming in her mind were not standard civil engineering.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for discovery, short beats for boardroom. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and syntax, which stay consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: she sees infrastructure ghosts where others see trash.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Metaphors (“neon rigs,” “water finding new channels”) are sparse, coherent, never flood a beat. Information density high—one line often does map work, emotional tilt, and world detail. Opening and closing lines are sharp and mutually resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Remixes familiar salvage-punk trope through civil-engineering optimism: rerouted utilities as life-support, sextant fragment as moral compass. Specificity—“rainwater runoff redirected through channels never designed for it”—grounds novelty. Conceptual risk (bureaucratic half-win instead of triumph) pays off, deepening theme. If transplanted to another colony, the core water-system insight would collapse, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
