<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her sudden blindness is felt as “swallowing glass.” The micro-choice to admit “I don’t see anything” crystallizes her arc; the laughter-into-song beat shows earned cost. Relationship pressure with Sable is light but sufficient; the pearl hand-off reweights status. No contradictory impulses in scene, yet the arc is more singular than layered, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s sight of the present lands with conceptual cost—thirty years of futures traded for now. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer intensifies until the chord reweights meaning. Orientation anchor (“Tuesday morning” taste) arrives by word 20; no debt. One tightening at pearl placement suffices. Cost is legible in the sternum-ache chord; persistent constraint (gift silence) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal walls, chiming footfalls, and bioluminescent organisms are filtered through Maren’s loss of sight, making setting an active constraint. The pearl micro-setting charges the final image—its pulse becomes the new metronome. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance corridor → chamber center → dimming exit. Environment supplies the acoustic and shadow mechanics that enable the unseen forces, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: regain perceptual agency. Pressure escalates via sensory density—each sonic/shadow layer strips her old gift without offering a new one until the pearl chord. The tightening is singular but meaningful: the cave forecloses predictive sight and offers only present immersion. Cost is the audible ache and lifelong blindness to futures; agency is expressed through attention and laughter acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the price of foresight is present-moment blindness. Subtext lives in shadow intersections and the pearl’s “seed” idea—returning what was taken. Final chord image reweights prior motifs (song, light, darkness) into a non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether Maren has lost or gained more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual blackout; diction tilts poetic—“room goes silent when someone says the unsayable”—yet stays within her sensibility. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for sensory glut, fragments for loss. No dialogue over two lines, each carrying subtext (“Nobody does. That’s the point.”). No head-hopping; Sable’s voice remains externalized. Distinct texture sustained under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative language is selective—“darkness so complete it felt bright” pays off. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds sonic or visual layer. One mixed metaphor (“laughter became part of the song”) is earned by closure. Information density high; no filler filters. Line artifacts do not touch final chord.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant stripped of future-sight by a singing cave that teaches present-sight. Shadow-door mechanics and cave-pearl seed invert standard prophecy tropes. Specificity—Tuesday taste, overlapping shadows—anchors novelty. Risk in lyrical accumulation pays off in resonant chord. Not a radical concept, but execution is singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
