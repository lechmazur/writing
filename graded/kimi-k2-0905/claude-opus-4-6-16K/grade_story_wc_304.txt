<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—precision vs. awe—stays embodied; every brushstroke is a micro-choice that costs her composure. The final act of sealing the chip is earned by the earlier meticulous ritual, so the renunciation of detachment carries visible price. Perfect calibration stops at 8.7 because we get no glimpse of a blind spot that might have sharpened thecost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the green flare reweights the premise, making “stillness” a live, radiant condition rather than absence. Causal chain—invitation → preparation → insertion → auroral response—holds without slack; the grotto’s physics are taught early and pay off. Cost is legible in Maren’s prolonged kneel and the silence that now “has substance,” foreclosing her habitual exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystalline grotto and aurora are not backdrop; their light re-tints pigments and finally ignites the chip, directly shaping tactics. Body-as-setting is equally precise: Ilse’s cheekbones and frost-lashed eyelids constrain brush choices. One decimal off 9.0 only because spatial anchors (distance to walls, exit location) stay implicit, not urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor Ilse’s last pattern—tightens once: the chip warms, forcing Maren to decide whether to proceed. That single escalation is sufficient under Accumulative lens; the stakes deepen from cosmetic task to cosmic resonance. Cost is felt in the sternum-tone and the hush that now owns her, but agency could be sharper if the warming created a risk of failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty as chosen stillness” emerges through pigment choices, auroral light, and the final green flare—never asserted. The emerald’s reprise reframes death from theft to collaboration, offering a non-literal answer. No moralizing, only image; the reader is left inside the radiant hush, re-weighting prior beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Maren’s perceptual signature—rhythms of static, color-shift calculus, breath-sync with ion-song. Syntax lengthens during meditative strokes, shortens at flare peak, mirroring internal pressure. No head-hop or filter clutter; every metaphor is one she could plausibly craft.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “Green and violet light poured through translucent walls, casting the interior in colors that breathed” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances pigment, aura, or emotional charge. A single near-purple phrase—“silence had substance”—is earned by prior acoustic buildup, so only hairline deduction.</comment>

<comment>“Beautician mortician” and sky-burial in an auroral geode synthesize fresh angles on death rituals. The ionospheric crystal grown by the dead woman herself flips the usual “ashes in space” trope into intimate physics. Conceptual risk pays off: the finale makes stillness luminous rather than cold, an inversion that feels inevitable once executed.</comment>
