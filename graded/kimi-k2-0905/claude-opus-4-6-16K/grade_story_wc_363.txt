<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sable’s refusal to speak and her turn to weaving loss into cloth are rendered with embodied patience; the final hand-to-tapeword beat shows contradictory impulses—endurance of exile and surrender to reunion—paid for by eleven silent years. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that Lien’s interiority is absent, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the silence reverses from fraying to completion the instant mother and daughter touch the beaded cloth—cost is the decade of life already spent. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each amber bead and puzzle strip layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is intact: because every road was sealed, therefore she weaves; because she weaves, the fragment travels back. No orientation debt; geography and timeline stay legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bamboo cathedral, iron-tasting stream, sap-amber beads—every tactile detail is filtered through Sable’s cloth-thinking and constrains her choices of material and code. The orchard’s swallowed sound mirrors her own, then acoustically flips when bamboo knocks at reunion. Micro-setting (bead = word) directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a mother make distance speak?—tightens when each failed letter turns into another strip of puzzle-cloth; the lone bead at center forecloses giving up. Escalation is textural: density of beads and months accrues until the returned fragment proves the weave crossed the border she could not. Cost is visible: “her hands ached,” pears eaten raw, years gone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of entropy: private, obsessive making can rethread political severance. Subtext sits in bead placement—left-margin survival, center love, right-margin permission—never named aloud. Final image of silence becoming “complete” reconfigures the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Sable’s cloth-minded perception: “knocked together in a language she almost understood.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with weaving rhythm; no head-hop. Compressed lyric diction stays within a mountain villager’s ken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long, filamented clauses to the staccato “Lien crossed the clearing.” No loops or scaffold; each image does double duty (pear sap = time + word). Figurative control holds: “stoically sparkling” risks ornament but is earned by prior refusal to sentimentalize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzles as loom warp is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of fracture and repair; amber beads as silent morse code particularizes the device. Risk—eleven-year wordless protagonist—pays off because closure needs no speech. Story would collapse if any generic material replaced these elements.</comment>
