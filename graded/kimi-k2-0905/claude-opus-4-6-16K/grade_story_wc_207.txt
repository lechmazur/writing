<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—her fingertips tasting “electric pressure” and the lime­stone “breathing”—and the final renunciation of understanding is earned by the psychometric assault on her certainties. Yet the contradiction between scientist-collector and mystic remains asserted rather than dramatized in a second beat, capping her below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A single causal chain—enter forbidden caves → recover compass → read catastrophe → abandon explanatory need—lands with unmistakable Charged Poise: the dash on the label reweights every prior vial. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 5 and never drift; cost is the foreclosure of her taxonomic drive, crystallized in the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The limestone fracture, calcium-locked compass, and black lens-still lagoon compress into a micro-setting that physically shapes her choices—she turns sideways, kneels, uncaps the vial at the water’s lip. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (carbide after-image, mineral silence), and the lagoon’s “scent with no name” recharges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she still catalog the world or let it remain ineffable?—tightens once when the compass reading collapses her epistemic map; option foreclosure is legible. No further escalation beat keeps the score south of 8.8, yet the single turn is sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the irreducibility of lived sensation to data: the vial labeled “—” re-prices her whole taxonomy without a sermon. Subtext resides in gesture—returning the compass to the calcium grave—implying respect for what cannot be mapped, a resonance that lingers beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person free indirect clings to Maren’s synesthetic perception—“the limestone breathed,” “the rock swallowed every certainty”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates during the psychometric flash. No head-hop, no filter clutter, and the final hush is voiced through her exhalation, proving coherent distance control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but disciplined: concrete nouns, no scaffold loops, figurative language reserved for hinge moments. A single mixed metaphor (“cathedral of the nearest stone”) nicks the closure-adjacent line, disallowing 9+ but leaving high-band readability intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Petrichor-as-memory-collector fused with psychometric geology feels inevitable yet uncatalogued in prior fiction; the 1931 expedition compass grounds the concept in regional history, preventing quirky ornament. Risk in marrying hard science diction to mystical epiphany pays off through earned sensory cost, meriting the upper band.</comment>
