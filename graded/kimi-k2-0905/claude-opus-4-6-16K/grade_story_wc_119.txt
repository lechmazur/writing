<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mei Lin’s contradictory impulses—compulsion to write fortunes vs need for exile—are dramatized through the act of sealing each new slip in a jar, a micro-choice that visibly accrues cost. The final renunciation (“The lighthouse does not chase the ships…”) is earned by prior causality: her uncontrollable prescience exiles her, so enduring the beam’s indifference becomes the only safe stance. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; “salt-eaten stairs” and “small white tongues” embody memory and guilt. Emotional progression layers realistically: unsettled agents, her own tea-making calm, the diplomat’s late unease—all circle back to her flaw without tidy resolution.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rotating beam reconfigures her life into perpetual vigil without pursuit, cost felt in the jars left unopened. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fortune compresses dread until the final image of the distant pulsing light reweights the pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“Gannet Rock”) and the pattern of jars/tea/boat schedule keeps present frame legible. No causality breaks; the diplomatic echo is coincidence that complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<comment>The lighthouse beam, mason jars, and salt-stung stairs function as micro-setting that constrains her only permissible action—writing then storing prophecies. Sensory selection mirrors POV bias: she notices rust, pulse intervals, cookie paper width “no wider than a breath.” Supply-boat timing (“after last orders at the harbor pub”) embeds social context without exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: helicopter arrives, agents leave, beam resumes—each move tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she stop her words from wreaking havoc?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when agents photograph every slip, foreclosing the option of public writing. Escalation is textural: density of fortunes increases, investigators’ unease deepens, until her only narrowing is to keep writing privately while the beam turns indifferently. Cost is visible: exile to twice-monthly supply runs, jars as bottled risk. No causal reversal, but deepening pressure under Accumulative lens suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—language as uncontrollable force—emerges from the microdot incident and recurs in the final diplomat cookie; no authorial thesis stated. Subtext carries in silence: she descends to make tea while the world reacts. Ambiguity is purposeful: are the fortunes predictive or self-fulfilling? The ending image reweights earlier material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers in the reader’s own unease about slips of language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: rhythmic anaphora (“this island, this danger, this way home”) taught early and paid off in the final rotation. Perceptual signature is precise—cookie paper measured by breath, beam timed by heartbeat—never generic. Compression (“transposed her life into a new key”) is patterned and legible. No head-hopping; POV distance remains steady inside Mei Lin’s wary calibration of hazard.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “fortunes accumulated…curling like small white tongues” shows noun specificity plus metaphor without strain. Rhythm modulates—long reflective cadences vs clipped investigative visit—supporting pressure. One loop risk: “tiny dense packets…expanded inside the reader’s mind like ink in water” borders paraphrase yet serves the microdot echo and is paid off. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses espionage thriller with lyric meditation; the fortune-cookie oracle is fresh, not gimmick, because it grows from Mei Lin’s occupational precision. Transformation test fails if cookie writer is swapped—her tactile knowledge of paper width and syntax is integral. Risky structure—mosaic of shards across years—holds coherence via the beam’s pulse pattern. Synthesis feels inevitable: language itself becomes the uncontrollable surveillance device.</comment>
