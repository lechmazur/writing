<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s inherited shame and hunger for motion are vividly anchored in childhood tagging and adult logistics obsession; the contradictory impulses (flee v. circle) surface early and tighten at closure. The final quiet renunciation—carrying worthless bills into dusk—pays off the boyhood dream of motion with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though “polished calm” edges toward label-speak once. Still, the calm acts as a trait that genuinely constrains his dissent at the startup meltdown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the worthless currencies re-weight the premise—circles are not failure but navigation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Dusk-to-dusk framing and three cleanly signaled time-shards (boy, founder, returnee) teach the pattern; cost is palpable when Elias pockets the bills he once thought magic. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no因果 breaks. One tightening only, but it suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The circus train functions as micro-setting: rotting velvet, rusted trapeze, and peeling calliope paint constrain Elias’s sense of sovereignty and later supply the image for his repricing. Spatial choreography stays clean across the three shards; weather (“bruised plums”) mirrors emotional state without overt symbol. Foreign bills as recurring object meet the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Detail is selective and filtered through POV priorities—motion vs. stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can one escape inherited routes?—is signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation: each shard adds a layer to the circle motif rather than causal reversals. The startup collapse supplies the single tightening that forecloses the linear-escape fantasy; cost is visible when Elias lets the company die without protest. Accumulative lens holds; no coincidence resolves. Agency sits in endurance/renunciation rather than decisive fight, fitting the quiet arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inexorably from particular images: foreign bills, charcoal marks, last-mile algorithms—each a failed route that still leads home. No explicit moralizing; the final dusky harmony reconfigures meaning without statement. Counter-readings linger: is the circle wisdom or defeat? Complexity upheld. Thematic echo within narrator reflection is brief and situated, avoiding final-paragraph thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—“routes existed beyond Route 9,” “weather in a room”—is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates: clipped logistic cadence in startup shard, lyrical elongation at close. No head-hopping; June’s interior is honorarily inferred. Filter verbs sparing and voice-motivated. Final paragraph’s mirrored stars achieve Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—“efficiency was his religion. Circles were waste.” Synecdoche does double work. Metaphors stay coherent (circus train as beast bones). Sentence variety supports momentum; no register drift. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The inherited-route-as-logistics-startup angle freshens the prodigal-son return; worthless foreign currency repurposed as closure talisman is specific and non-obvious. Circus + tech juxtaposition feels organic, not gimmick, because both orbit the same metaphor of optimized motion. Risk in circular structure pays off; transformation test passed—swap setting or object and the emotional math collapses.</comment>
