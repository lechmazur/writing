<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lenora’s curiosity is concrete—she pockets the hearing aid, lingers after shifts, opens her notebook—so the trait drives every beat. Interiority stays specific: “studied the textures of each bond” rather than “felt sad.” The final choice to stay with the sister until the mist lifts is earned because her earlier nosiness has already cost her detachment. Only the woman’s grief is sketched lightly; a single sensory tic would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mist lifts, the pulse fades, and Lenora forgoes filing to walk the woman home—cost is the surrender of clinical distance. Causal chain holds: curiosity → trace → bench → assurance → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“glass doors…open-roofed chamber”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the hearing aid is introduced, used, and relinquished in order.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The atrium’s mist is not backdrop; it erases feet, thickens time, and only dissipates once grief is spoken, charging the final image. Droplets suspended in copper light mirror the suspended grief, constraining visibility and therefore Lenora’s approach. The bench and photograph function as micro-setting, forcing proximity and tactile exchange. One sentence (“vast, open-roofed chamber”) risks generic scale, but immediate sensory filtration rescues it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect a stranger from fatal heart-echo—signals early and tightens at the bench when Lenora realizes the woman is the target. One meaningful deepening: she shifts from observer to participant, surrendering emotional neutrality. Cost is legible: she stays past shift, carries the woman’s weight, accepts the file will be late. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—love’s residue as both wound and lifeline—emerges through the hearing aid’s crackle and the mist’s slow lift, never named. Subtext lives in gesture: the woman’s coat “too large for her” implies hollowing by loss. The final image of damp streets reframes earlier copper light as shared blood, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Only the phrase “heroism was almost always incidental” flirts with echo, but it is immediately grounded in the physical act of holding on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, filtered through Lenora’s cataloguing mind: “catalogued the patterns in a notebook she showed no one.” Syntax lengthens under compassion—“she held on, understanding that heroism was almost always incidental”—mirroring the sustained embrace. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“mist pooled,” “pulse grew stronger”). Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and tonally distinct from narrative clause rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “the last daylight bled copper through suspended water droplets” does triple sensory work. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, stakes, or interior shift. Metaphors stay coherent—mist as held breath, pulse as sonar—and terminate before mixed overlap. One near-purple phrase (“reeling hush of the mist-clad atrium”) is earned by emotional apex and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts”—is non-obvious yet instantly credible, turning municipal bureaucracy into ghost-lore. The decades-old analog hearing aid as emotional Geiger counter feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk is taken with quiet, anti-cathartic ending—no exorcism, only accompaniment—and it pays off by reconfiguring heroism as presence. Specificity of the atrium photograph prevents concept from floating into generic after-life trope.</comment>
