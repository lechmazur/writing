<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s calm, data-driven response to mortal danger is vividly particular; the “cloud-by-emotion” logbook dramatizes her need to measure absence. Interior contradiction is present—scientist vs. grieving daughter—but the moment of highest stakes (telescope to eye instead of screaming) is repeated rather than deepened, so the cost feels static. The final stance is earned, yet the logbook’s circulation among pilots is reported, not dramatized, muting the visible price she pays. Still, her perceptual signature and micro-choice hierarchy are consistent and memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty core “catches her,” reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical observation thickens the texture of absence until the final image crystallizes. One minor causal wobble: the rescue helicopter’s appearance is pure coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so permitted. Orientation is achieved by word 30; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Altitude, cold, and the brass telescope function as micro-setting that constrain her choices—she writes until hypothermic, proving absence through star-bending. Selective sensory detail (dusty starlight, ice crystals bending light) mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: gondola drifts, she stays seated, telescope remains in hand. The sky is never described generically; each cloud image is filtered through her taxonomic obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove absence is measurable—is signaled early and tightens through each emotional cloud entry. One meaningful deepening: the 64th category “spooled wholeness” reweights the stake from personal grief to universal principle. No external antagonist needed; pressure is existential and coherent. Cost is felt (hypothermia, isolation) but could be sharper if a single cloud refusal risked data loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: absence is an active force, proven by refraction rather than presence. Subtext lives in the act of naming clouds by emotion—science subverted to elegy. Final image of the empty spool that “catches” her offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo; the insight stays embodied in the telescope and logbook.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Maren’s meteorologist idiom—“dusty starlight,” “barometric drop”—syntax calm even at 16k feet. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“wrote faster”). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The lyric cadence is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final line without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, each advancing atmosphere or insight. Opening and closing lines are precise, bookending the spool image. A single over-ornate phrase (“quietly explosive”) is allowed because it is later redefined through action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of meteorology with grief taxonomy feels inevitable yet fresh; no extant template matches “clouds indexed by emotion.” The brass telescope as inheritance-relic reframes astronomical seeing as elegiac measurement—specific, irreplaceable. Risky lyrical structure is held by coherent accumulative lens without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses without the emotional cloud atlas.</comment>
