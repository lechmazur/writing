<comment>Erasmus’s contradictory impulses—blade vs. needle, institution vs. idea—are dramatized in the tactile sundial reading and the final refusal that costs diplomatic immunity. The interiority stays concrete: brass fingers clicking, shadow-angles felt, not labeled. The mother-memory needle card is returned to twice and tilts the present choice, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Only slight flattening: Solenne’s “velvet-gauntlet” stance is vivid but her internal pressure is guessed, not accessed, keeping relationship crucible one-sided.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: late arrival → sundial decoding → refusal, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change—he walks away, forfeiting immunity and chair, cost legible in “whatever destination the question had revealed.” Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Micro-turn: the needle card covers the cipher, physically foreclosing acceptance before he speaks.</comment>

<comment>Glass-walled atrium and murmuring brook are filtered through Erasmus’s combative attention—light becomes “rippling bands across her face like oscillations of an argument.” The half-painted sundial doubles as both cipher-tool and micro-setting that literally steers the beat. Spatial choreography is clean: door, pedestal, departing footfalls track. Environment does not merely mirror mood; the gnomon’s shadow angles physically deliver the offer he ultimately rejects, meeting the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—intellectual integrity versus institutional protection—is signaled early and tightened once: immunity dangled, then refused, with the sundial decoding as the irreversible pivot. No false escalation; the single tightening suffices for 700-word scope. Cost is concrete—three warrants remain live, laboratory access forfeited. Agency sits entirely with protagonist; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—philosopher as weapon versus thinker—emerges through gesture (blade vs. needle) rather than assertion. Final image of walking “toward whatever destination the question had revealed” reweights the mother’s seam-stitch maxim without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“Is there a difference, Professor?”) lets power dynamics glint beneath courtesy. Complexity is preserved: refusal neither celebrates purity nor demonizes pragmatism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect voice stays tight to Erasmus: lexicon of fencing, Kant, and gear ratios; perceptual signature notices “endless, indifferent commentary” of water. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for contemplation, staccato when the door opens. No head-hopping; Solenne’s interior accessed only through Erasmus’s inference. Metallic clicks inherited by gears from lost flesh is a sonic motif that recurs without formula.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “He read them now with his mechanical fingers tracing the dial’s edge, calculating angles by touch and internal gearing” advances action, reveals method, and keeps body present. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“diplomatically fierce,” “velvet gauntlet”) fits heightened political fencing. Final click of needle card echoes opening gear click, closing sonic pattern cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing epistemology with literal swordplay is audacious yet executed with tactile specifics—Viennese courtyard lost arm, sundial cipher, mother’s needle compass. The premise could slide into gimmick, but every beat roots the duel of ideas in material stakes (warrants, laboratory, immunity). Fresh synthesis:裁缝’s thread-to-road philosophy weaponized into a refusal that costs everything. Risk heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
