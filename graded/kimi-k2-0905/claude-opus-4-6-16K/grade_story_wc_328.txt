<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s covert mission and bitter-wonder shift are credibly anchored; the arrowhead talisman and nightly phone vigils dramatize obsession. Interiority stays concrete (“rubbing its knapped surface when the underground dark pressed too close”). Final kneel is earned—bitterness meets cosmic joke via prior causal chain—yet slight emotional shorthand in “understood Petra now” keeps it from full 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure delivers resonant reconfiguration: gravity flickers, Maren weeps/laughs, her voice begins recording—cost is felt and conceptual. Accumulative lens holds: arrowhead seed → confessions → chamber descent → echo loop. Orientation anchored by 120 words; noLens drift. Persistent constraint (gravity-play) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Underground garden is living pressure system: roots move, stones orbit, moss pulses—details filter through Maren’s researcher eye and constrain every step. Micro-setting (arrowhead, phone) doubles as tools that charge closure. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room beats. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses under-used keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what changed Petra—tightens when Maren decides to descend. Agency visible: nightly listening, talisman carry, final offering. Escalation tracks accumulative deepening (static → confession → chamber) with visible weight-flicker cost. Could use one earlier tactical loss (time, tool, social risk) to sharpen trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of bitterness transmuted into wonder emerges through Petra’s mutated papers, gravity-play, and Maren’s culminating laugh—no explicit thesis. Final image reweights prior rejections as “frostbitten hope” without moralizing. Subtext in cordless phone recursion (“her own voice was already beginning to record”) offers icy echo of cosmic joke.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps strict Maren-filter: perceptual signature blends scientific noticing (“Clovis-era, impossibly old”) with sensory awe. Rhythm modulates—long cathedral sentence vs staccato “It braids water.” No head-hop; inference marked (“she understood”). Prose-as-character: syntax mirrors gravitative play (“weightless and weeping and laughing”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines multi-task (“Static poured from it like breath”). Metaphors disciplined; only one near-mix (“gravitationally playful” is saved by Petra’s self-quote). No scaffold loops, no filter stacks. Read-aloud rhythm rises toward flicker moment, then exhales. A single adjective overload (“raw edge where bitterness meets wonder”) barely grazes 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fuses cryptid inquiry, underground bioluminescent garden, and recursive cordless confessions into fresh constellation. Arrowhead-as-offering reverses colonial-find trope; gravity-play rewrites haunt-house. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in闭合 image of researcher becoming next recording. Feels inevitable yet unseen before.</comment>
