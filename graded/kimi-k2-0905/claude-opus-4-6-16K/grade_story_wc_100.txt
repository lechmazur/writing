<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet obstinacy is dramatized through the single decisive act of reassembling the lens; the interior ache is anchored to each grave she digs, giving the final renunciation credible cost. Interiority stays concrete and occupational—no therapeutic self-talk. The “inadvertently stubborn” trait could use one on-page micro-choice that visibly backfires before the dive to fully earn the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Earned Stasis: she gives the city rest by letting it die, and the ache vanishes—cost is legible in the opaque water that erases the coordinates. Causal chain (package → map → dive → lens → silence) is tight; no prop or information teleporting. The lens reassembly beat is the decisive physical act that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library is not picturesque backdrop; its coral-books and impossible tower directly supply the hollow column where the lens must be restored, constraining her action and charging the final image. Sensory triage—brine, itch, crystalline depth—filters through the undertaker’s professional eye for stillness. Spatial choreography is clean: rooftop → reading rooms → central tower → lens housing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she answer the call or keep her own stillness?”—tightens once: she chooses to descend, then must finish the burial. The pressure is situational but coherent; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible when the city exhales and the coordinates blank out, foreclosing return. A slightly sharper midpoint obstacle (suit malfunction or disorientation) would push this into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: rest is something you grant by letting go, not by fixing. The lens motif moves from fractured distress to whole inward light, reweighting the premise without a stated moral. No echoing thesis lines—final image of opaque ordinary ocean is the quiet repricing. Complexity is preserved: she gains peace by extinguishing a world’s last signal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is undertaker-precision: “fourth body demanding attention,” “grave-quiet,” palms that itch from light not brine. Syntax lengthens underwater to mimic breath-through-wheeze, then shortens on surfacing. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent. One clause drifts slightly academic—“conceptual repricing of stillness”—but the texture overall is controlled and particular.</comment>

<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only faint echo is “stillness” used three times in closing paragraph, but each use shifts connotation so it reads as accrual, not churn. Metaphors are spare and precise: “schools of silver fish moved… like thoughts passing through a sleeping mind.” No mixed vehicles or filter-verb stacks. High information density without purple inflation; final line lands with cadence punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker buries an entire drowned civilization via lighthouse lens repair—concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet nowhere clichéd. Impossible-space library tower reframes familiar “lost city” trope through bibliophilic grief. Risk of surreal interior lighthouse pays off because the lens shard setup teaches the rule early. Specific occupational gaze keeps it from sliding into abstract fantasy tableau.</comment>
