<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s gift is concrete—she palms the film, feels acetate dust, and the interior contradiction (“wanting to find where unused love is stored” vs. withholding Luce’s identity) drives the final renunciation with visible cost. The only drag is a brief diagnostic label “psychometry” that momentarily abstracts her embodied sense.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each handled object layers density until the eight-frame strip catalyzes a resonant reconfiguration—Maren chooses eternal storage over delivery, cost legible in the crib-like set-down. Orientation is clean by line 5; closure lands with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Projection booth as micro-setting constrains every beat—acetate scent, rewinding table, clouded lenses—and charges the final image when Maren places the strip “as though placing a child in a crib.” Spatial choreography remains exact; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens when Maren discovers Luce was looking back; the knowledge forecloses the executor’s goal and alters Maren’s stance with felt ethical cost. One decisive deepening satisfies short-form escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: unspoken love migrates into objects, culminating in the earned insight that some devotion is meant to remain “in iron and dust.” No moralizing; resonance is non-literal and reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—architecture of feeling, hushed thunder—stays stable; syntax lengthens under awe, contracts under revelation. No head-hop; POV distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do double duty (“celluloid slowly remembering its own flammability”). One paraphrase loop (“letter after letter, year after year”) is minor; no figurative muddle touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: psychometry as archival storage of unreturned love, enacted in a forgotten projection booth. Risk-taking (renunciation instead of revelation) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
