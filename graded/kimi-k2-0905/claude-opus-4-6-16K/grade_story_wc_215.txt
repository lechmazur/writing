<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s solitude-driven motive is vivid, but the pivot from passive witness to active caretaker arrives in a single summarizing paragraph; no embodied beat shows her deciding to stay. Interiority is otherwise textured and consistent; the astonished recluse trait surfaces in her flinch at ghost-intimacy. The final stance is credible, yet the cost feels ambient rather than personally staked on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discovered object (husks, box, letters) layers silence until Maren’s reading reframes it into responsibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she closes the box and chooses endurance—cost rendered in “weight…pressing against her ribs.” Orientation clean by 120 words; one causal micro-jump (wild bees rumored) is too minor to wound escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Scorched oasis and desiccated hive matter to every beat: heat-warped frames bar reuse, mineral seep dictates future water strategy, stained-glass light patterns the moment of witness. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Maren’s attention—visual hush first, then tactile mineral crust. Environment directly shapes her decision to remain and repair. One minor spatial drift: “largest remaining structure” appears without prior establishing skyline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she carry or flee the unspoken silence—tightens when the ghosts’ expectant mouths pressure her to open the box. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: reading reweights solitude from refuge to responsibility. Cost is present yet diffuse; no concrete forfeiture (time, safety, resource) is risked on the page, keeping the beat below 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-repair emerges through hive carcasses, letters, and mute ghosts—never named aloud. Final image crystallizes the idea that some silences must be inhabited, not escaped, reweighting Maren’s earlier flight. Subtext in ghost lip-sync is effective. A hairline slip toward thesis appears in “she understood finally why she had walked here,” but it is anchored to concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Maren’s astonished perceptual filter: “noise of other people’s eyes” is idiosyncratic and memorable. Rhythm swells and contracts with heat-haze languor; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue to test, yet the silence itself is rendered as voiced action. One lyrical run—“light…like something living”—is earned and pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare but textured; sentences vary in length and openers, sustaining momentum. Figurative choices (salt tears, confetti husks) are concrete and non-competing. One paraphrase loop—“she had left…she had retreated…she had nearly forgotten”—is noticeable but brief and does not touch closure. No scaffolding, no mixed metaphor; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Ghost-legibility trope is refreshed by pairing with apiary extinction; covenant through bees and letters feels specific to this world. Risk-taking lies in the lyric stillness—climax is reading in colored light—yet it pays off. No close echoes of iconic scenes. Concept could still travel if relocated, but the hive-silence linkage provides enough irreplaceable texture to retain freshness.</comment>
