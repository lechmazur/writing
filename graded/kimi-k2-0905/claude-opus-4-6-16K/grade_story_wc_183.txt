<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her twin’s cellular presence is rendered as “a ghost who was also the house.” The final naming is earned: every prior clue converges, and the embodied warmth shows a paid cost. Minor flaw: the “match finally catch” epiphany edges toward label-speak, blunting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each found object thickens atmosphere and narrows the stake to the single name. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—fog thins, ship stops, warmth ignites—cost is legible in one breath. Architecture bends because memory does; pattern taught early, paid off in greenhouse sprawl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is character: tilted midway, bleeding paint, impossible greenhouse stretching past hull limits constrain every step. Emerald card and paper tags act as micro-settings that finally charge the image. Selective sensory hierarchy—smell of caramel and sea rot—filters through Maren’s alienated body. One notch off perfection: spatial scale of the nursery-to-greenhouse leap could tether one more tactile cue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—name the twin—signaled in paragraph two and tightened with each clue; the greenhouse door narrows options to speak-or-not. Cost turns visceral when speech of the name halts the ship; prior drift becomes stillness, price paid in irrevocable recognition. No reversal needed; single deepening suffices under accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of latent identity emerges through vegetal metaphor—names as pressed flowers, cells as roots—never sermonized. Final spoken name reweights “unkindled solace” into lived warmth, achieving conceptual repricing without moral. Ambiguity lingers: she remains trapped, but now haunted knowingly. Complexity honored; no tidy thesis imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance, perceptual signature steeped in maritime decay and medical precision. Syntax grows slightly clausal under stress yet stays purposeful. No head-hopping; fog and shifting corridors mirror cognitive slippage without violating focal control. Distinct voice sustained to final breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“rusted hull carving slow arcs through the fog”) propel without clutter. Metaphors interact—bleeding color, broken teeth—without mixed collision. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for drift, fragment-like bursts at revelation. One scaffold loop spotted (“She was free. That was the cruel precision of it.”) but compression outweighs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chimera science with maritime ghost-carnival is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. “Garden of Forgotten Names” converts botanical archive into ontological ledger—fresh yet grounded. Risk of impossible greenhouse pays off by literalizing memory’s stretch. Conceptual integrity intact; no retreat to safer realism.</comment>
