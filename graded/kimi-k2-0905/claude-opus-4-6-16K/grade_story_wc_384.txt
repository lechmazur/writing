<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—master forger who cannot forge her own mother—drives every beat; the micro-choice to write in her own hand crystallizes the arc with visible cost (“the weight that left her collarbone was geological”). The 20-year obsession is embodied through tactile ritual (rose-thorn stylus, ink ground from resin) rather than abstract grief. Flaw is specific: her precision becomes paralysis until the key’s release reframes identity. Only minor slip: “wisely enduring” is named, not dramatized, trimming the final 0.1.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the letter finished in her own hand reweights the premise—she renounces forgery while completing the document. Causal chain holds: rain-ruined letter → decades of rehearsal → key discloses permission → she chooses authenticity. The key misdirect (lock that never existed) pays off conceptually, unlinking need itself. Cost is legible in one line: “I forgive what you could not finish, and I forgive myself for needing it finished.”</comment>

<comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites form a micro-setting that mirrors interior state without overt symbolism; the open roof under shifting sky externalizes the possibility of release. Rose thorn and iron key are handled repeatedly, their weight and texture anchoring choices. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—aurora colors named like inks, water drips counted like pen strokes. Environment never overwhelms action; each detail either constrains (cold floor forces kneeling) or charges the final image (key abandoned on stone).</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether to forge her mother’s missing lines—tightens once: after 23 years of perfect replication she abandons the deception. Escalation is textural rather than causal; each drip and aurora shift accumulates density until the key’s removal collapses the need. Cost is felt immediately: she forfeits her lifetime identity as ghostwriter to become author of her own imperfect line. No external antagonist required; internal contradiction supplies sufficient pressure.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: authenticity as an act of surrender rather than creation. The heritage thorn, once tool of replication, becomes stylus of self-forgiveness—a re-pricing that reweights all prior forgeries. Subtext is embedded in gesture: laying down the key = laying down the need for completion. Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, achieving CR.</comment>

<comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains perceptual signature: colors “like silk dissolving,” consonant tremor read as maternal wrist drag. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fractures into shorter units at the moment of release. No head-hopping; aurora descriptions remain filtered through calligrapher’s eye. Only minor drift: one instance of slightly academic “conceptual repricing” register, quickly re-anchored in bodily sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates with pressure; clauses widen during memory, tighten at decision. Metaphors are mixed but purposeful (“pearl twilight,” “mineral deposits in a cave”) and never repeat. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Line that lands closure is lean and unadorned, letting ink and thorn carry weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Forging as maternal elegy is fresh; inversion of forgery into self-authored forgiveness feels inevitable in hindsight. Aurora-roofed sanctuary fuses natural wonder with private ritual, avoiding generic grief settings. Key that unlinks rather than unlocks supplies conceptual twist without late-rule gimmick. Risk in lyric stillness pays off: interior action carries stakes usually reserved for external plots.</comment>
