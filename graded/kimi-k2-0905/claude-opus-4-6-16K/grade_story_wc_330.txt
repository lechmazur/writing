<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s mute devotion and embodied carving choices are vivid, but the singing pivot hinges on an external object rather than an internal contradiction; the final endurance is earned yet the cost feels more luminous than painful, keeping the renunciation just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every sensorial layer thickens until the halo fragment catalyzes a cadence shift that reweights silence into song; the closure is a Charged Poise where the new quiet now carries the afterimage of voice—undeniable conceptual cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desert-train micro-setting constrains every move: alkali flat leaches color, kerosene lamp limits work hours, the swan’s hollow literally hides the fragment; these tangible constraints charge the final image where the shard’s fire projects onto unfinished beasts, fusing place and stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake—breathing life into dead carousel—tightens once: the shard demands song, song demands exposure, exposure commits Elias to an audience of none; the price is felt (his chest loosens, voice escapes) but the escalation is a single intensification, not a progressive vise, holding it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as generative medium, art as private resurrection; the final image reconfigures the premise—song doesn’t break silence, it charges it, leaving the reader to weigh solitude against witness. No moralizing, only luminous implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person stays tightly latched to Elias’s perceptual filter—chisel calluses, lamp-whisper, wood memory; diction is carved, not painted, syntax breathes with sanding strokes; the singing release modulates into longer vowel-paced phrases, teaching the reader the pattern and paying it off in the hush that follows.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") and recurs to charge closure. High density without purple strain; final line crystallizes prior motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines desert-ghost-train, mute carver, relic halo—yet renders them inevitable through sensory carpentry; the risk of lyric stasis becomes the very engine. Fresh inflection: song not as communication but as private restoration, making silence louder. Only the coyote coda feels briefly familiar, nudging it under 9.0.</comment>
