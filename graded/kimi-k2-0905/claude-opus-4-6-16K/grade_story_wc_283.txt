<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient guild member vs. subversive decoder—remains asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page moment forces her to risk guild standing. The final “quietly inspired” beat is label-only; cost (excommunication, loss of vocation) is projected, not felt. Buttons and canyon-echo supply texture, but choices are solitary and friction-free; no relationship crucible or status reversal tests her. Micro-choices (order of buttons, jar-corking) read as ritual, not escalating stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy’s deterministic shell cracks and futures multiply; cost is legible in the Guild’s looming resistance and Maren’s solitary climb. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of button-syllable accumulation → cadence shift into sung chord. Orientation anchored by word 30; no penalty. Only one meaningful tightening—the chord—sufficient at this length; earlier beats accumulate rather than narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amber warehouse, iron stairs, mineral drip, and skylight angle are selective, sensory, and filter through Maren’s professional eye. Canyon echo in a jar functions as micro-setting that constrains the final test; its evolving resonance charges the closure image. Button grid and amber light angle are recurring objects that materially shape the decoding act. No spatial drift or white-room gaps; geography stays consistent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the future from prophecy—signals early, but escalation is purely accumulative: each button adds syllable density rather than narrowing live options. No external antagonist or deadline; tension hinges on whether the echo will harmonize—an internal, low-risk test. Cost is conceptual (Guild opposition) rather than visceral; no concrete loss on page. Single meaningful turn—the sung chord—reweights meaning but does not foreclose a path Maren was shown to value.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: determinism vs. possibility, seeds not commands. Buttons as forgotten syllables and canyon as deep listener supply concrete particulars; no final moralizing. Subtext carries in silence after chord: “unearthed silence” reweights prior auditory motifs. Ambiguity lingers—Guild may still force obedience—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed third-person stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“phoneme pressed into its surface”) remains within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences build to the short release of the sung chord. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Canyon-echo variations (“glisten/loosen/lessen”) create internal rhyme without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances texture, backstory, or concept; no synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors (warehouse “held its breath,” dust “slow galaxies) are controlled and payoff in closure image. One mixed metaphor—echo “sang… set the dust motes spinning”—but clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beat shifts; paragraph cuts purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Button-as-lost-phoneme and canyon-echo-as-wisdom-engine are fresh syntheses of familiar materials; prophecy-reversal via mundane artifacts feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure over causal reversals, paid off in resonant chord. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity: premise followed to open-ended future without retreat.</comment>
