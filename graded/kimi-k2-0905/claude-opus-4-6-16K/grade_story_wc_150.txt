<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Adaeze’s contradictory impulses—engineer’s detachment vs. re-awakening reverence—are embodied in tactile choices (touching roots, placing kola). The final renunciation of spiritual emptiness is earned by the catacomb’s cumulative pressure; cost is legible in her broken Igbo apology. Minor slip: “tired of being half-anointed” drifts toward diagnostic self-label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “interrupted journeys” thickens via root-bone entwinement, climaxing in the noon-light crossing the return symbol—Charged Poise with felt cost. Orientation clean by line 6; causality intact. One soft spot: sundial base discovery feels lightly motivated, not strictly inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every move—roots dictate route, reinforcement mimics their geometry, final image is root-dappled light on bone. Sensory hierarchy filtered through engineer’s gaze: load-bearing checks, mineral deposits, fruit-light spectra. No spatial drift; geography taught via lantern movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore faith vs. structural collapse—tightens when removal of roots risks destroying the dead. One meaningful deepening: roots themselves are “interrupted” yet endure, mirroring her exile. Cost legible: she forfeits sterile detachment, accepts enchantment. Escalation is accumulative pattern rather than causal turn, fitting lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of interrupted/continued journeys emerges via recurring root imagery and re-translation of Nsibidi symbols; no explicit thesis. Final kola offering reweights earlier “word without weight” into cautious re-enchantment. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Adaeze’s perceptual filter—engineering metrics, Igbo fragments, root textures. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments under risk. No head-hopping; free indirect clean. Distinct syntactic signature carries through final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High的信息密度：roots “threading through dark hair” does twin sensory/character work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors organic. One mixed vehicle: “fruit-light dappled” briefly overlays visual-tactile registers but doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: structural-engineer diaspora returns to heal a living tomb whose struts are fig roots entwined with bone. Risk-taking (orchard-as-catacomb) heightens stakes without gimmick; payoff inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail—Nsibidi symbols, camwood half-anointment—prevents generic transplant.</comment>
