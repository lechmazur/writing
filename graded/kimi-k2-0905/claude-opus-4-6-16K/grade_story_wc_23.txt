<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s grief is anchored in tactile ritual (the censer foot as paperweight/plumb bob) and her “patchwork” credentials are dramatized through soldering and splicing, not labels. The final listening stance is earned: each night of labor converts abstract longing into an instrument that can register loss as geography. Interior contradiction—hope vs. the knowledge that the signal is “not a rescue”—is held inside the closing image without therapeutic gloss. Only the absence of a micro-choice in the climax (she simply sits and listens) keeps this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the moon-set thinning of the signal reweights the premise—“the distance itself holds shape”—with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every night’s soldering adds density until the final cadence shift makes the geography of loss navigable. No因果 gaps; even the midnight call that repeats her own coordinates folds the search back on itself, foreclosing escape. Cost is legible in the single line “she would chase again tomorrow night,” proving the path is open but the child is still gone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The frozen dishes, prairie wind, and star-weighted sky are filtered through Maren’s technician-grief gaze; detail is selective, never scenic wallpaper. The bronze censer foot operates as micro-setting: its cold travels up her arms to map sorrow inside the body. Setting constrains the final image—she sits on a concrete platform under a savage sky, nothing turning but her—charging the closure with spatial loneliness. One decimal off 9.0 only because the exterior array is sketched more vividly than the interior control room, leaving slight white-room at the console.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can loss be mapped and navigated—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the caller sends her own coordinates back, folding the quest into a closed loop. The moon-phase fluctuation acts as an external ratchet: full moon = strong signal, so time itself narrows her options. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological. The cost is felt—she will return every night—but the beat stops at stance crystallization rather than a new irreversible action, keeping this just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of migration: instead of arrival, a parent learns to inhabit the empty vector. The bronze foot’s shift from paperweight to sternum-anchor reweights “trace” as something you hold inside bone, not find in space. No moral is stated; the final whisper leaves ambiguity intact—navigation may be infinite. The concept of loss-as-geography feels inevitable yet non-obvious, synthesized through solder burns and starlight rather than thesis.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Maren’s perceptual hierarchy: maritime charts, radio static, clawed bronze temperature. Syntax lengthens under starlight, then fractures into short clauses at “she pressed the censer foot against her sternum,” mirroring cardiac rhythm. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; “the stars pressed down like a weight” is valid inference from her amateur-astrophysics past. Voice is distinct, controlled, and modulates with emotional pressure without ever explaining itself.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 8-word pulses to 32-word coils, accelerating soldering beats then breathing at moon-set. Metaphor density is high but patterned—“sunflowers tracking a dead star,” “savage with stars”—each re-illuminating the dish-as-deserted-flora motif. Zero paraphrase loops; “she listened until the moon began to set” is the first and only use of that verb phrase. The final line’s caesura before “she would chase again tomorrow night” lands with earned exhaustion, no syllable wasted.</comment>

<comment>Transforms the familiar “parent searching for missing child” by weaponizing radio astronomy as emotional cartography: loss becomes a navigable spectrum. The reverse-migration concept is made concrete through coordinate phone calls and moon-phase signal strength, not abstract label. Bronze censer foot—a relic one would expect in a gothic tale—becomes a leveling tool for hard science, a synthesis that feels specific to this narrator. Risk-taking (no reunion, no body, only a whisper she’ll chase forever) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
