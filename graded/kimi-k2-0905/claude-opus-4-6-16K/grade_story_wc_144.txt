<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied expertise and calm authority are vivid; her micro-choices (resin stroke, thermal “read” over the trough) reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The internal contradiction—grief over imperfection vs. serenity in mending—stays active in scene, earning the final “I will always be here” as Earned Stasis with visible cost: permanence of her exile in the depot. Soren functions only as urgency conduit; no status shift or contradiction, so relationship crucible is thin, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: micro-fracture → resin → water-test → symmetrical hum → launch → swarm confirmation → ship sails. Anchor (who/where/when) is secure within 120 words; depot, mist, blind tech, ticking anchor chain all in place. Closure is a Decisive Change: Aurelia gains directional life; Elara’s cost is the unchanging depot darkness she accepts. Persistent constraint—her blindness—shapes every tactic and is reiterated in the final line, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, trough, and hummingbird drone create a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: condensation feeds the mirror Elara needs; mist muffles sound, sharpening her tactile acuity. The depot’s rusted iron and groaning winch root urgency without tourist detail. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, doors, platform edge track cleanly. Environment is not merely mood; it supplies the literal medium (water mirror) that gates the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—drone must fly before anchor finishes—is signaled early and tightens through each beat: resin stroke, water test, Soren’s doorway hover, chain clank accelerating. One meaningful escalation: asymmetry detected → patch → clean hum; no reversal, but option space narrows to “now or never.” Cost is Elara’s spent time and Soren’s gamble; both are legible. Coincidence absent; agency resides in Elara’s calibrated action under倒计时 pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending as compass emerges through concrete repair beats; no abstract sermon. Final image—Elara turning to the next broken thing—reweights “direction” from ship’s navigation to her unending vocation, a Conceptual Repricing with quiet cost. Subtext in Soren’s cupped hands (reverence for tech he can’t fix) enriches without statement. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in perpetual depot exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elara’s haptic perception; diction—“thermal language of scattered light”—is idiosyncratic yet controlled. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for calm, clipped “Clean. / Outside, a horn sounded.” for pressure. No head-hopping; Soren’s anxiety is read through sound and weight-shift. Voice sustains magnetic calm while allowing micro-crescendos, meeting 9+ distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence advances tool, body, or stakes. Mixed metaphors absent; mist “like breath across cold glass” is singular and taught early. One paraphrase loop—“the way a musician recognizes a tuned string” slightly restates prior hum—but too minor to obscure closure. Filter verbs minimal and motivated; syntax breathes under pressure. High-band control with hairline slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind female tech savant using water-refraction as QA device in mist-soaked rail depot is not a stock image. Stakes hinge on micro-repair of drone membrane—intimate, not epic—yet ship’s maiden voyage depends on it, reversing usual scale. Trope of “crippled genius” is redeemed by specificity of method and refusal of pity. Risk is moderate; could push further into geopolitical implications of drone swarm navigation but wisely keeps lens tight.</comment>
