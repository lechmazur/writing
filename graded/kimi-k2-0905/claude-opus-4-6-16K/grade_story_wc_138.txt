<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vael’s 11-millennia ache is rendered in concrete, embodied beats: the amulet burning her collarbone, her palm pressing it while corridors invert. Interior contradiction shows in the same breath—she whispers exit-words yet insists she does not want to die, only to witness. The final renunciation lands because every spatial-warping step was motivated by that exact tension; cost is visible as the Escondite screams in ozone. Still, the beat that converts boredom into “quiet thunder” is slightly abstract—an emotional leap rather than a dramatized micro-choice—holding her just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: solar storm → magnetic destabilization → Vael’s centuries-rehearsed incantatory geometry → seam opens → she chooses to watch, not enter. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“Not goodbye. After.”—that reweights every prior loss; the cost is the refuge left in ruin and the amulet’s curse still clamped to her bone. Orientation is swift; who/where/when anchored inside 40 words. One slight wobble: “whispered architecture” does the work of describing how dimensions obey her—too compressed, almost hand-waved—but causality itself never snaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Escondite’s violet/gold corridors, frequencies only Vael hears, and membranes she can fingertip-read all filter through her dimensional synesthesia, giving every detail POV pigment. The storm’s magnetic groan is tactile, makes floors ceilings, and forces her final stance—setting directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting (amulet against collarbone) constrains choice by anchoring her to existence. A hair more spatial choreography during the corridor inversion would have nudged it into 9+ territory—momentary reader vertigo is part of the desired effect but slightly under-drawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the seam offers a live answer. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: she weaponizes the storm rather than enduring it. The visible price is her refuge’s ruin and the irreversible knowledge that departure is luminous, not blank. Cost is legible, but because the amulet’s binding remains intact the external constraint doesn’t tighten further—pressure plateaus instead of spikes, keeping it beneath the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via refracted particulars: immortality as architectural scaffolding, mortality as woven light-beams that continue building reality. The final reconfiguration—departure is not absence but “After,” a relational fabric Vael already inhabits—rings as earned insight rather than aphorism. Subtext hums in the amulet’s cooling silver: the curse she cursed becomes the chain that lets her stay and witness, flipping burden into gift. No editorial compression or moralizing; meaning stays inside image and choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited drapes itself in Vael’s synesthetic lexicon—“colors that tasted of iron,” “hushed thunder”—maintaining perceptual signature throughout. Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, then fractures into staccato clauses as dimensions revolt, mirroring her pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all stakes; diction stays within an 11-millennia scholar’s range without drifting into purple. One clause (“quiet, dangerous thing she now carried in her chest”) inches toward self-conscious lyricism, minor enough to leave the 9-band reachable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences build cosmic scale, then a four-word sentence—“The seam opened.”—punctures. Density is high; most lines do two jobs (description + causal nudge). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is selective. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she felt it first as a tremor”). A single scaffold phrase—“she was not destroying… she was rearranging”—is justifiable counter-point rhythm, not artifact. Closing image is crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Trope mash-up—immortal hermit, cursed amulet, living palace—gets re-wired through hard-SF magnetic topology and a metaphysical reveal that the dead become ambient architecture. Specificity sells it: “corridors of violet, gold, and impossible colors that had no mortal names” feels native to this pocket dimension. Risk is taken in rejecting literal death as payoff; the inversion earns freshness without gimmickry. A half-point shy of 9 because the solar-storm-as-key mechanic is a known SF device, slightly blunting surprise.</comment>
