<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and her need to “mirror the sky inside walls” are concrete, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the renunciation of the sketches is an earned, visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time—interiority is retrospective—so the 9+ bar is just missed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the coin deepens pattern until the final press into bark crystallizes the limit. Closure is a Charged Poise—“vastness is defined by the point where vision ends and wonder begins”—with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oak-library is sensory, lived-in, and filters every action; the coin-as-micro-setting constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; one sentence (“She climbed out through the narrow door...”) could anchor sooner, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her art’s limit—tightens once: sketches are abandoned because they can go no farther. The abandonment is agency-driven, but no new tactical cost is felt after that beat; pressure plateaus rather than re-weights options again.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through the coin’s recursion and the sky-metaphor; the ending re-prices “recognition” itself without moralizing. The refrain of approaching the unknowable lands as Conceptual Repricing, resonant and un-statemented.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric, consistent distance; perceptual signature is tactile-fractal (“mathematical architecture beneath a face”). No head-hop; patterned elision (“Cartographies of the Interior”) is taught early and pays off in the safe’s renunciation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density, rhythmic variation; only one scaffold loop (“the sketches... the sketches”) and no mixed metaphor. Final line propels without overreach; a single filler (“simply existed”) keeps it from flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist mapping identity through coin-topology is fresh synthesis; the oak-library images feel inevitable yet un-echoed. Risk is interior/lyric rather than structural, limiting the upper bonus.</comment>
