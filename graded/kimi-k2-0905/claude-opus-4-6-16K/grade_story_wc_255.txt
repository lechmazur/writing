<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—trading effortless skill for uncertain, trembling sight—lands with cost. The innocently-cunning bargain reshapes both her art and Fen’s courtyard, but the emotional tremor is reported rather than dramatized in-scene, muting the highest-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed’s return reweights Maren’s perceptual world and Fen’s self-regard, cost paid in her shaken brush-hand. Accumulative lens holds—each painted failure and planted cipher layers until the final cadence crystallizes the exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Furnace glow, cracked molds, and reed tongue function as micro-setting that steers choices: Fen only yields after seeing his discarded work transfigured on the walls. Spatial choreography stays clean; a few static floral labels momentarily stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the reed—tightens once through the mural bargain; the final tremor of lost fluency makes the trade legible. Pressure is textural rather than kinetic, coherent under Accumulative lens, but only one meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of bartered perception emerges from painted “failures” and floral cipher rather than pronouncement. Final image—ash catching light “only Maren could truly paint” —reweights the premise without moralizing, though prior plant-code verges on allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice maintains a painter’s tactile idiom—“architecture of a petal’s curve,” “orange hymn”—with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, mostly loop-free; selective metaphor serves density. Occasional elevated diction (“cathedral of imperfection,” “bartered awakenings”) slightly overshoots Maren’s grounded lexicon but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Color-blind painter decoding world through texture then receiving unnamed hue feels fresh; floral-cipher and reed talisman synthesize personal and mythic scales. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off, though phoenix backdrop remains atmospheric rather than transformative.</comment>
