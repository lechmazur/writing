<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s “subtly confident” precision is dramatized through micro-choices—sketching condensation rivers, pressing warm glass, walking onto the lake—each action carrying visible cost (isolation, forfeiture of former certainties). Interior contradiction is present but thin: one line of self-diagnosis (“Blankness was her enemy”) is the only interior label; the rest is embodied perception. The final renunciation is earned because the escalating pattern of moisture-maps forces her stance; the cost (solitude, surrender of editorial control to natural logic) is felt on the last line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she steps onto the blank lake, relinquishing atlas logic for the pattern itself; the warm-glass touch supplies undeniable physical cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each condensation sheet deepens the fractal proof until the single coordinate appears. Orientation is clean by 80 words; no teleporting props; the phrasebook’s dog-ear pays off in the final line. Only a hairline slip: the falcon’s “empty return” is declared significant but never loops back into stakes, leaving a faint outline of a Chekhov-gun never fired.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, ice-sweating walls, and frozen lake function as micro-setting: condensation patterns literally rewrite cartographic knowledge and steer her final step. Falcon, phrasebook, and warm glass each return with altered state, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—window to locker to lake-center tracked without drift. Environment constrains choice at every beat; no description is decorative. This meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the singular convergence”—is signaled in paragraph 6 and tightens when every window overlays into one coordinate, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: each new condensation map increases density of proof rather than external danger; the cost is loss of prior epistemic ground. The protagonist’s agency is assertive—she chooses to walk onto the lake after the pattern erases alternatives. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the falcon’s message merely confirms isolation, not outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory and source are inseparable—emerges through the Evenki root word and the final equation of blank ice with “full of beginnings.” No character states the moral; meaning accrues via glass-maps and the relinquished atlas. Ambiguity is purposeful: convergence beneath ice could be metaphysical or hydrological. Sentimentality is avoided; the emotional after-effect is chill wonder rather than triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance, filtrating every detail through Maren’s cartographer eye (latitude recall, tributary precision). Syntax is crisp, rhythmic, subtly sardonic—“a barnacle that had outlived its ship.” No head-hopping; condensation lexicon stays inside her professional register. Filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated. The final sentence’s cadence mirrors a river finding course, completing the prose-as-character arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and world-rule simultaneously—“The walls sweated with condensation despite the cold outside, moisture pooling on every glass surface in slow, branching patterns.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare, never stacked; mixed registers absent. Opening and closing lines are precise bookends. Only minor hedge—“in a way she couldn't name”—a tolerated concession to interior limitation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses hydrological fractals with linguistic etymology to rewire cartographic epistemology—fresh, non-obvious, yet inevitable given the POV’s vocation. Risk is taken in eschewing external antagonist for pattern-based escalation, and it pays off. Transformation test fails if “atlas editor” is swapped out; the whole logic collapses without her occupational lens. No derivative scent; the piece stakes out singular territory.</comment>
