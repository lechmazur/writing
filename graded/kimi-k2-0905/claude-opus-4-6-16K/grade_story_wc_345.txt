<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sable’s embodied actions (kneeling to touch the warm chalk, climbing to strike the arch) display credible interior contradiction—curiosity wrestling with grief—yet the interiority stays somewhat generic (“puzzled,” “grief pooled”). The communal shift from stranger to kin is asserted rather than dramatized in a single scene, so the cost feels diffuse; still, her ringing the copper bell is a concrete micro-choice that crystallizes the colony’s reconfigured trust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern is taught by the second chalk line and held to the final “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN,” a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the premise with undeniable communal cost. Transitions are legible across the mosaic shards (dawn discoveries, ridge climb, later harvest), and the ghost’s chalk messages supply the because/therefore linkage that drives each escalation. Closure lands with felt price: the ghost vanishes, leaving the settlers permanently responsible for their own continuing chalk covenant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating rock arches that “wept crystalline water” after a pole strike provide a tactile, choice-constraining environment; the copper bell’s clear tone anchors spatial choreography across the ridge. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under urgency (warm chalk, ringing drops) rather than tourist-catalog visuals. The orchard planet’s rules stay consistent—mineral rain activates dormant fungi—integrating setting into causality rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can strangers who have become family trust one another enough to save their only home—tightens when each chalk command forces a public test of shared competence. The mineral-water discovery is a genuine narrowing of options: recycled supplies failed, arches succeed, tactics pivot. Cost is visible in the ghost’s disappearance and the settlers’ permanent pre-dawn chalk labor; still, the colony’s political frictions remain off-page, muting the highest-band bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accretion of sidewalk messages: survival depends on converting shared loss into mutual capability. The copper bell’s return at the end reweights its meaning from personal heirloom to communal call, achieving thematic resonance without pronouncement. The final line “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN” offers a charged conceptual repricing: the living, not the dead, must cultivate hope—a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice owns a distinct cadence—long breathy sentences that mimic slow orchard dawns, then clipped fragments for chalk lines. Nebula-violet hue and “ribs of some slumbering god” are idiosyncratic perceptual signatures that stay consistent under pressure. No dialogue appears; the narrative’s rhythmic propulsion and copper bell acoustics compensate, keeping voice singular and controlled.</comment>

<comment>Prose density is high—“trees had begun to die... soil exhaled dust where it once breathed sweetness” does world-building and stakes in one stroke. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “accumulative pattern”) nudges academic register but stays within the narrator’s reflective stance. One mixed metaphor cluster—“sanctuary made visible” trailing nebula light—barely muddies the arch reveal; otherwise syntax breathes with scene tempo and avoids loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “altruistic ghost via sidewalk chalk” angle freshens the dying-colony trope, synthesizing mysticism with collective action rather than lone saviorics. Specificity of the copper monarch-watering bell and mineral-rain arches anchors the concept in irreplaceable detail. While the “strangers-become-family” frame is familiar, the inversion that the ghost’s final absence is the true gift pushes the premise past boilerplate uplift.</comment>
