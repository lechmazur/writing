<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “decisive kindness” is dramatized through the dulcimer choice and the unflinching phone call; Harold’s eleven-year silence and instant recall of June’s number embody a believable contradiction. Interiority stays concrete—grooves in vinyl, Tuesday smell of ironing—without therapeutic self-labeling. The final micro-choice (pressing the two shards together) crystallizes earned change at visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-aligned vinyl reweights the premise—goodbye can include breakage—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: blood-work failure → song → phone → reunion → fused record, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Tuesday…nine thousand feet”). Cost is legible in the cracked-groove image that ends the piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The altitude’s thin-air acoustics and white-gold light are returned to at closure, constraining how sound carries the forgiveness frequency. Micro-setting (vinyl shard on nightstand) doubles as moral pivot. Selective sensory hierarchy—vinyl gleam, cloud line, corridor coffee smell—filters through Elara’s musician perception without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time to repair estrangement—tightens once: “no time” after blood work → call now. The dulcimer hymn escalates by compressing mundane specifics into sacred litany, forcing Harold’s whispered request. Coincidence (June kept her half) complicates rather than resolves; the cost is the irreversible crack that still lets the song play.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—ordinary life as hymn capable of tunneling through silence—emerges from cereal, mail routes, cracked vinyl, never abstract assertion. The fused yet scarred record offers a non-literal answer: wholeness accepts fracture. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is felt in the nearly continuous grooves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s musician ear: “sound carried differently…a single struck note could hang.” Syntax lengthens to mirror sustained resonance, then shortens for the call. No head-hopping; Harold’s laughter is overheard, not interiorized. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose breathes with variable rhythm—long lyrical sentences for hymn, staccato for phone beat. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“clouds pressed…like curious animals”). No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“liquid light” beside “crack nearly disappeared”—but context keeps it legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of music-therapy hospice + broken vinyl + altitude acoustics feels idiosyncratic and inevitable. The “hymning the mundane” method transforms postal minutiae into sacrament without gimmick. Risk—elevation as liminal portal—earns its keep by shaping sound physics that enable closure.</comment>
