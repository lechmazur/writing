<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “tender shadow keeper” label is asserted early but never dramatized in a present-tense beat; we are told she “absorbed” others’ darkness, yet no on-page moment shows her doing so or refusing to. The 43-day exile is a strong external motive, but interior contradiction—why now, why here—stays abstract. Micro-choices (ring twist, palm scar press) are vivid, yet they feel like emblematic gestures rather than irreversible acts that foreclose a path. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, but the cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to ash, stars, ring, and breath thickens the texture until the final exhalation reweights “enough.” Orientation is taught by the second sentence; who-where-when remain stable. The closure image—ring on ash like “a small dark mouth”—delivers Conceptual Repricing: the tool of ingress becomes an icon of relinquishment, cost legible in the shift from knuckled iron to mute object. Persistent constraint: the vanished walls literalize the fading threshold, forcing the choice to occupy space without guarding it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the body-as-chapel (palm scar, knee patch) and the ring-as-door charge every beat. Ash under fingernails, cold iron taste, and star-pressed darkness are filtered through a caretaker’s hyper-attuned sensorium. Spatial choreography is immaculate: cross-legged center, ring placed before her, shadow stretching behind—final image tracks cleanly. Environment literally constrains: no walls, no door, therefore no threshold to guard—this enables the renunciation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she learn to hold her own shadow—signals early. Escalation is lyric-cumulative: each breath tasted thicken the cost of staying. One decisive tightening at the ring-release shifts options from guarding to occupying. Price is felt (breath rattles) but not externally tested; stakes stay interior, fitting the 700-word lyric frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the concrete reversal of caretaker → self-occupant. Motif of “linking through scars” returns reweighted: once threads to others, now only her shadow behind her. No moralizing; the final “enough” is an earned resonance, not a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—ring placed, not hurled—silence doing the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: charcoal taste, cold iron weight, star soot pressing down—every observation is caretaker-calibrated. Rhythm breathes with scene: clauses lengthen during reflection, shorten at “She breathed in. She breathed out.” No head-hop; distance stays close-third. Diction stays within lexicon of a rural caretaker who burns down what she tends.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold, zero loops. Information density: “timber once stood” packs 3 senses in 3 words. Metaphors are coherent—stars as encroaching soot—never mixed. Final line cadence mirrors opening clause, creating echo without symmetry. Minor −0.1: “tender shadow keeper” is repeated noun-phrase label; trimming one instance would sharpen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The caretaker who burns the chapel she once tended, then occupies its absence, is a fresh moral calculus. Synthesis of arson-as-mercy + self-rescue via vanished threshold feels inevitable after the fact. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: no corpse, no villain, yet stakes feel absolute. Slight edge off 9+ because the premise could transplant to another ruin with minimal rewrite.</comment>
