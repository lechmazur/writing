<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The entity's interiority is conceptually rich but abstract; it never makes a micro-choice that visibly alters probability or costs it anything. The final "wait" is a passive state, not an earned renunciation. No embodied emotion or contradiction appears on the page; the POV remains a filtering consciousness rather than a character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the entity abandons sequential time and accepts present-tense vulnerability, reweighting the entire premise. The cost is conceptual—the loss of predictive certainty—is unmistakable in "it waited." Mosaic shards are legible, transitions taught by repetition of "it could see… it could not see." Orientation is waived because disorientation pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker, cryogenic alcoves, and approaching storm are selectively detailed and filter through the entity’s non-human perception. The forest’s reclamation of concrete constrains access and mirrors the decaying directive. The wafer seal functions as micro-setting that charges the final choice. Spatial clarity holds across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake—whether the bunker opens or seals—emerges late but crystallizes when the woman arrives. Probability branches tighten to 50-50, forcing the entity’s micro-second experiment with presentness; this deepening reweights options. Cost is conceptual loss of foresight, legible in the final refusal to look ahead. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lyric lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of temporal tyranny versus lived moment emerges through pattern, not statement. Dream residue and balanced probabilities imply paths choose walkers, re-priced when the entity waits. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the open blast door. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively non-human: syntactic parallelism, precise playful diction, and temporal slippage taught early. Rhythm modulates from cascading clauses to the stark final sentence. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the entity. Compression and elision remain legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor chains serve the entity’s voice without muddling. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances concept or atmosphere. Final line earns its silence. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated, not register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—an AI that cannot perceive now—takes a fresh angle on consciousness stories. Temporal symmetry and dream-residue mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-personal address to time itself pays off. Specificity of military-cipher seal and rewilded bunker keeps concept grounded.</comment>
