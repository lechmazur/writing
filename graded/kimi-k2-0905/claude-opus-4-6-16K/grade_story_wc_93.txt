<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—visions as storm-to-tide shift—surfaces bodily in trembling hands and weeping; the final stillness costs her a lifetime of scattered sight. Micro-choices (each stone placed, pigment mixed) tether promise to present action. Backstory is anchored to sensory cues (vial, sand, eel) and tilts her stance. Earned renunciation of chaotic foresight reads as credible endurance with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the web of light crystallizes her stance, reweighting visions from curse to tide; cost is the lifelong chaos endured to reach this poise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—Fibonacci spirals, eel mirrors, pigment webs build density until the cadence shifts at the final stone. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; no debt incurred. Causality: frictionless world enables pattern visibility; her arranging enacts coherence—no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Tidal bluff, pigment vial, and aurora-lit water function as micro-setting that constrains her arranging ritual and supplies the mirrored eel pattern. Selective sensory triage—shimmering star dust, sinusoidal lapping—filters through her professional gaze. Spatial choreography tracks body, stones, eels without drift. The aurora’s “borrowed dawn” charges the final image, reweighting the premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she tame the visions?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each stone adds density until the web ignites, foreclosing the option of perpetual scatter. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure mounts via vision barrage and eel mimicry. Final spiral narrows choices to coherence or madness; price is lifetime of debris already absorbed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: pattern as relationship between observer and observed, friction as noise masking coherence. Sacred geometry motif shifts from decoding attempt to lived reciprocity. Final weeping image reweights grandmother’s promise—freedom is not escape but navigable tide. Ambiguity lingers: coherence brings responsibility to steer futures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries luminous, salt-tinged cadence suited to aurora-lit bluff; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon. Perceptual signature—numeric spirals, eel ribbons, star dust shimmer—remains consistent and biased. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk. Rhythm accelerates with stone placement, exhales into final stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Density high—“frictionless water moved differently” marries physics to mood. Metaphors (aurora as borrowed dawn, eels as luminous ribbons) cohere without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph earns its lyric lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Frictionless world as reveal for sacred-pattern visibility is fresh; eel herder profession specific and irreplaceable. Collapsed star dust pigment fuses cosmology to ritual. Risk of lyric accumulation pays off when eel spiral mirrors stone web. Conceptual reprice—“visions become tide”—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Her elusive herding expertise shapes attention to eel formations, which in turn validate her stone sequences; without it, the mirror epiphany collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Star dust appears early (vial), activates pigment, recurs in spectral web and final glow; its cosmic origin reweights the mundane rocks into star maps.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Grandmother’s promise drives every arrangement; the final stillness reconfigures its meaning from escape to mastery, closing the loop with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Precognitive curse is not label-only: random visions intrude mid-action, exhaust her, and force the arranging quest; coherence is the costly remedy.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Harness action literalized: she harnesses the tide of futures by placing the final stone; the verb migrates from eel guidance to vision steering.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mathematical sequences taught early, tested in middle beats, and fulfilled when final spiral locks, enabling the web of light and eel mirror.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Tidal bluff supplies frictionless water whose perfect curves let eels mirror her stones; aurora provides borrowed light for pigment activation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Frictionless world functions as ticking clock: only now can the masked pattern surface; delay risks eternal vision scatter, sharpening urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Desire to understand patterns is dramatized through ritual arranging; tension between needing coherence and fearing what it reveals fuels every stone.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Borrowed dawn” tone modulates from eerie aurora to earned steady glow; the final image charges the phrase with cost and clarity.</comment>
