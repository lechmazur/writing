<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—rational locksmith who courts the inexplicable—drives every micro-choice; the final silent tear is an embodied cost that forecloses her former detachment. The “harvest of echoes” tests her hierarchy of values and leaves her altered, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the cavern keeps “wonder” arriving while Sable’s tear refracts candlelight—an undeniable conceptual repricing of her original goal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo tightens the pattern and reweights stakes without causal reversals, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The marble’s light-geometry literally constrains tactics—she predicts echo-returns by reflection angles—so the setting charges the final image. Micro-setting (the timer’s bent wheel) also governs pacing, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“store wonder in reason”—tightens when the cavern returns “wonder” as an endless state, forcing her to accept unquantifiable experience. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is the tear that signals irreversible cognitive shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of her locksmith metaphor: the lock that can never be picked is endless wonder itself. No moralizing—final image of refracted tears reweights earlier data-collection without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“stood in the threshold wondering what the opening meant”—is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with the broken timer’s lurches, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances atmosphere while integrating tool detail. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; high information density sustained to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “harvest of echoes” reframed as temporal lock-picking is fresh; the broken timer as mapping device transforms a familiar cave-quest into epistemic horror. Risky lyric closure pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
