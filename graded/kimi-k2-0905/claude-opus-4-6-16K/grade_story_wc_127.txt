<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—her drive to fuse insight with empathy collides with her career of selling half-truths—but the embodied cost arrives only in the final swallow; earlier beats keep her clinically efficient, muting micro-choices that would show flaw-driven mistakes. The earned renunciation (“she would never again mistake the half for the whole”) lands because the blotter petal dissolution dramatizes irreversible fusion, yet the decade-long preparation stays off-page, softening the visible struggle that must pay for this moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the blotter petal dissolves, fusing Lida’s loneliness into Maren, foreclosing her prior mercenary detachment with unmistakable emotional cost. The amber grotto’s remembered static teaches an accumulative lens early; the final pulse reweights the premise without causal reversals, satisfying the 9+ cost test. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amber walls’ crackling static is not backdrop but medium—its remembered resin literally delivers Lida’s emotional fingerprint, constraining the fusion ritual and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s perfumer discipline: scent molecules precede sight, touch is filtered through pipette and paper, all integrated into action rather than catalogued. Spatial choreography remains exact as she kneels, palms, packs; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—own a whole truth instead of trafficking halves—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens once: the swallow that dissolves the blotter petal forecloses her professional aloofness. Pressure is situational; no antagonist is needed because the grotto’s ancient memory and her own ritual force the stance crystallization. Cost is legible in her weeping recognition, but escalation is single-note; no secondary complication raises the ante further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: commerce versus communion, half-truth versus whole grief. The blotter petal’s reprise—bergamot and cedar collapsing into lived loneliness—reweights the stakes without moralizing. No late symbolic graft; the amber’s recording property primes the idea from the opening sentence. Ambiguity remains: she will still sell counterfeits, now carrying an unpriceable whole, letting complexity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Maren’s synesthetic discipline—scent molecules, static sparks, vial weights—creating a distinct perceptual signature that modulates into trembling recognition when the full grief hits. Syntax stays controlled, almost clinical, mirroring her professional thoroughness; only in the swallow does diction slacken into weather metaphors, taught by the moment’s rupture. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from resinous long phrases to the staccato tool list, propelling the ritual beat. Figurative density is high but patterned—honey, jar, weather—each reappears to pay off at closure. No synonym loops or scaffolding; information density remains high without cluttering the microscopic space of a single cavern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Counterfeiting emotions via fossilized resin and scent blotters feels specific and non-obvious; the fusion ritual turns a familiar “feel what she felt” trope into artisanal perfumery meets paleolithic recording medium. The concept commits fully—no late rule changes—and the emotional payoff grows from that invented physics rather than imposed pathos. Risk is moderate but coherent; no derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
