<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear—keep wonder alive—but she never makes a visible, high-stakes choice that costs her anything; she only adjusts bells and watches visitors cry. The seasonal muteness is named, not dramatized; it never once blocks or shapes an on-page action. Interiority drifts toward abstract thesis (“wonder was the only honest response”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Without a micro-choice that forecloses a path, characterization remains observational, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Structure is accumulative/textural: pattern of wind-activated sculpture sessions that deepen theme. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; no causality break. Closure is a Charged Poise—“every spectrum said… stay awake”—that reweights prior material with conceptual cost, satisfying RR. However, no causal tightening or option foreclosure occurs; the piece ends in crystallized stasis rather than decisive change, capping score at mid-6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bluff, copper wires, cooling chamber, and shifting prisms are tactile, idiosyncratic, and filter every beat through Elara’s tuner’s eye. Wind, altitude, and ice refract choice: the sculpture can only exist here, tying setting to stakes. Micro-setting (the iceberg fragment) literally charges the final image with spectra that reconfigure meaning. Environment is not backdrop; it is the engine the story cannot run without.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep wonder alive—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or resource limit; pressure is atmospheric, not escalating. No middle beat narrows options or exacts a price from Elara; she merely repeats tuning and observing. Visitor tears signal impact, yet she sacrifices nothing and risks nothing. Accumulative pattern deepens theme but does not tighten the protagonist’s agency or raise cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the sculpture’s spectra and visitor reactions rather than explicit statement. The silence-after-words concept is handled as lived history, not premise dump. Final image—“stay awake to this”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the wonder question. One minor echo of thesis (“wonder was dying”) is allowed; no moralizing paragraph appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s tuner perception: measured, auditory, sternum-level. Syntax modulates from long breathy cadences to hammer-fall fragments that mimic bell strikes. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within plausible artisan lexicon. Voice is distinctive enough to be recognized in a blind extract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; figurative language is patterned and taught early (“clouds whispered like a congregation”) and paid off in the final spectra. No paraphrase loops, filter-verb stacks, or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold phrase—“the world was organized into something almost unbearably coherent”—is allowed for peak beat. Rhythm accelerates with wind events and breathes during reflection, propelling rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-language society sustained by bell-sculpture wonder—feels fresh, not recycled. Tuner-as-last-artisan and ice-core prism are specific, not archetype swap-outs. Risky lyric accumulation pattern is fully committed to and pays off in closure image. While the emotional arc is quiet, the conceptual frame and sensory engine are memorably particular.</comment>
