<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior skepticism is viscerally embodied (“tongue pressed to the roof of her mouth, tasting copper”) and her inheritance of snow is credibly foreshadowed; still, the final beat states “she had always known” rather than dramatizing the instant contradiction that earns the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted weather-signature thickens the pattern until the compass points back at her, producing a Charged Poise closure (“let the snow she carried finally fall”) with undeniable conceptual cost—she becomes what she questioned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lavender stalks, aurora color-fields, and the spinning tin ring work as micro-setting that constrains attention and finally charges the image; spatial orientation on the bluff is stable; one over-rich simile stack (“curtains…chromatic pools”) slightly dulls peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do people carry weather?”—tightens when the compass turns inward, foreclosing neutrality; the escalating taste-catalogue acts as accumulative pressure; cost is legible (“she tasted snow…belonging to both the ground and the void”) yet the beat is observed more than chosen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—weather as planetary consciousness using human synapses—emerges through concrete sensory cataloguing rather than thesis; the final snow reweights all prior skepticism into inheritance without moralizing; “terrestrially cosmic” flirts with abstraction but is grounded in taste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific skepticism filtered through synesthetic tasting of atmosphere; rhythmic control in layered clauses mirrors aurora pulses; no head-hopping; occasional elevated diction (“barometric pressure”) stays within an atmospheric scientist’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence adds scent, myth, or tool function; no loops; one mixed metaphor (“chemical ballots…election”) lightly strains; figurative language clusters at key beats but never obscures causality; final image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Weather-as-consciousness via gustatory synesthesia feels fresh and inevitable; the tin compass reframes genealogical inheritance as atmospheric synapse; risk in blending hard science with vegetal democracy pays off; only minor cap for not fully transforming the grandmother trope.</comment>
