<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s discerning curator trait is shown through embodied micro-choices (sitting to wait, turning the locket, choosing silence) that escalate to advocacy; the final renunciation of speech beside Dolores costs her the comfort of detachment, earning the closure. One contradictory impulse—professional detachment vs. communal responsibility—plays out in scene, not summary. Interiority stays concrete and voice-particular; no label-speak. The locket’s return and the withheld letters reweight relationships across the courtyard, proving listening as lived stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s silence beside Dolores crystallizes a new communal equilibrium and charges the courtyard’s future with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each neighbor’s shard adds density until the manager’s 30-day notice breaks the pattern, forcing Maren’s stance. Causality is intact: because she listened, she located Dolores; because the notice threatened erasure, she acted. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The honey-dawn light and working fountain pressure Maren’s ritual of waiting; the locked mailbox’s brass face is a tactile constraint that orients every beat. Bougainvillea color returns in the final image, recharging the courtyard as communal body. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across bench, mailbox, and care-facility room. Micro-setting (locket hinge crack) functions as charged object-as-setting that constrains the hand-off choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can unheard stories be kept alive—tightens when the destruction notice converts abstract care into urgent rescue. One meaningful deepening: the daughter’s letters shift from rumor to live evidence, reweighting the cost of failure. Maren’s agency drives the escalation under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the mailbox. Price is visible: she forfeits anonymous safety and absorbs Dolores’s grief in person.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: listening as communal repair versus disposal culture. Subtext lives in gesture—Gerald “still had it,” Rosa’s hand to chest—never sermonized. Final image of neighbors seeing mailbox and sky “for the first time” reweights prior material without moral. No echoing thesis statement; particulars carry universals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s curator sensorium—she notices salvage, weight, patina, silence. Syntax lengthens under reflective pressure, then fractures into short beats at the care-facility reveal. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct. Dialogue-free design is choice, not omission; interior voice sustains rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. “Still Here” engraving recurs with reweighted meaning, not decoration. Figurative language is selective—violent bougainvillea, raw honey light—never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence often paints time, object, and emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Quiet premise—unclaimed mailbox—made fresh through thrift-store curator POV and neighborhood oral mosaic. Risk of dialogue-free accumulative structure is embraced and paid off. Specific detail (donations-bin mug, hairline hinge crack) prevents generic “missing elder” trope. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
