<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s folded-grief coping mechanism is vivid, embodied, and powers the final release; the twentieth-lantern refusal/replay choice shows contradictory impulses in scene with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the single epiphany sentence “giving permission to unfold” drifts toward label-speak, blunting the full 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lantern replay and crane adds density until the final dream ruptures the pattern, yielding earned stasis as Maren swaps folding for drawing. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—grief re-instrumented from origami to flat charcoal wings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating tea garden, pavilion rail, detached shadow, and basilica across the gap are rendered through Maren’s selective attention; every environmental detail (jasmine, bergamot, thermal drafts) doubles as emotional barometer. The basilica’s final glass-to-crane transformation charges the closure image, meeting 9+ constraint requirement with only a hairline slip of extra adjectival uplift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to view the last dream—tightens once at the shadowless hour; the replay irrevocably widens grief’s container, satisfying escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible (trembling hands, shift to flat paper), yet the beat is solitary; no external opposition amplifies pressure toward the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting grief into motion emerges organically from lantern-light, origami cranes, and the basilica’s paper flight; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image reweights earlier folding ritual into open-ended creation, delivering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains precise psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through craft metaphors (gem polishing, creases, luminescence). Rhythmic control crests in the dream projection sentence that runs long then fractures into short beats, mirroring emotional spill without syntactic scatter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, largely loop-free; mixed metaphors (“grief was a kind of light — blinding… impossible to hold”) read deliberate and consistent. One scaffold clause “across the gap” repeats within fifty words, minor enough to stay above 8.8 cap line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dream-capturing lanterns merged with origami grief-craft feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior story combines these precise mechanics and metaphorical payoffs. Transformation of basilica into paper crane crystallizes the concept, making the fantastical emotionally self-evident.</comment>
