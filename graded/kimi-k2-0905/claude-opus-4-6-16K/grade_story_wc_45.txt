<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s bone-setter pragmatism and reluctant yearning are vividly embodied; the micro-choice to pull the tooth and then follow the changeling crystallizes her contradiction. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final hand-clasp shows earned shift: skepticism kept but path foreclosed—cost felt in the star-tooth pressed to palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tooth-pull → yearn → maze breach → garden confrontation, each beat narrowing options. Closure is Charged Poise: “the path home became something new” reconfigures stakes with visible cost—she walks on, certainty permanently cleft. Orientation anchored by 110 words; no teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Foxglove beside luminescent moss and humming ivy fuse folk and tech in one tactile breath; garden’s scale and wildness constrain Maren’s choices—she must kneel, offer hand. Micro-setting of the wooden puppet’s loose enamel tooth charges the final image when she pockets it again. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover real Gemma—signaled at tooth discovery; pressure tightens when maze rearranges behind her, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful reversal: skeptic forced to act on fairy logic. Cost legible in irreversible certainty fracture; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “mistakes as constellations” emerges through bone-setting metaphor and tooth-star image; never stated, only shown. Final image reweights premise: skeptic’s fracture now a navigable light. Ambiguity preserved—no moralizing, only charged invitation to forgive the unknown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—medical precision meets folklawe. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for skeptic doubt, clipped fragments at tooth pull. No head-hopping; diction stays within village healer lexicon. Dialogue brief, subtext-rich: “I leave things behind so people will come looking.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences multi-task: “clean snap of a fracture finding its true line again” delivers sound, metaphor, character vocation in one breath. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse under peak pressure. Final line breathes, no overwriting. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Changeling lore fused with biomedical realism feels inevitable yet fresh; bone-setting as fairy negotiation is new. Garden’s tech-ivy resists twee, creates uncanny tilt. Risk-taking—quiet lyric closure rather than rescue fight—pays off by reconfiguring worldview, not plot mechanics.</comment>
