<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Milo’s hunger to “translate between generations” is embodied in every micro-choice—winding the box, layering sounds, deciding to walk to town—so the final gesture feels earned. The contradictory pull between hermit isolation and communal gift tightens through the beat sequence. Cost is visible: he seals the dawn chorus with “trembling hands,” then steps into exposure, deserting his safe bunker. Only the cats witness, but the interior stakes scale to the ancestral absence that drove him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern (jars → layering → offering) taught by 25% mark; closure is Charged Poise: the gallon pickle jar pressed to his chest reweights all prior gleaning with public risk. Causality is lyric rather than plot-swivel, but each shard advances the sound-archive goal. One transition (loft → town path) is cleanly anchored. Cost is legible in the final image—“ lantern” against lonesome splendor—so lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting—the concrete bunker’s cracked ceiling and battery scavenges—constrains his scavenging tactics and determines the dawn-hatch ritual. Dune lung, hammered gold, salt-shaker napkins: sensory triage filters through Milo’s poet-bias without checklist drift. Spatial choreography stays continuous as he packs jars and steps onto the path. The music box’s corroded cylinder is handled twice, charging the final composite sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove nothing vanishes if someone holds it”—tightens when the anonymous lullaby risks being lost again unless he shares it. The layering of live dawn + three stored sounds creates one decisive escalation that forecloses private ownership; once mixed, the archive must leave the loft. No coincidence; all pressure is accumulation of his earlier captures. Visible price: exposure to the town that once mocked him.</comment>

<comment>Theme of trans-generational salvage emerges through the tactile jar ritual, never abstract assertion. Final image reframes “redemption” as itinerant offering rather than possession, sidestepping moral tag. The wistful lullaby threads an ache the children will inherit as nameless hunger—quiet irony that lands without sentimentality. Subtext in cat silences and unmarked pickle jar deepens the loneliness-of-custody idea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Milo’s sensorium: “sand in his beard,” “salt like tips paid in reverse.” Syntax lengthens during the dawn recording, then compresses for departure, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature is penny-poet scavenger, consistent to final step. Rhythm control peaks in the layered release of sounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective—“dunes shifted like breathing… hammered gold”—and never clutters the high-stakes beat. Sentence variety supports the accumulative cadence; no template chains. Information density high: one line can anchor setting, backstory, and object (“He had lived beneath the dunes for three years now…”). Only micro-loop: “sealed with wax and labeled” echoes next clause; barely intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sound-jar premise feels singular; not a trope rewrite. The “vagrant penny poet” archetype is re-animated through scavenged electronics and pickle-jar sacrament. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off with the dawn mash-up that reframes archive as gift. Specificity of Mrs. Aguilar’s hum and tern cry prevents generic “nature” collage.</comment>
