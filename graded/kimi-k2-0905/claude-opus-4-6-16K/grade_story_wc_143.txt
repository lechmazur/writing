<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s vigilance is embodied in every beat: tripod placement, vial-whisper, chemical brush-stroke. Contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. parental guardianship—co-exist in the same gestures, giving her a live interior. The final renunciation (descent with only an image) carries visible cost: she forfeits any later claim to intervention. One decimal off 8.8 only because the father backstory is delivered in a single expository block rather than being pressure-tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the photograph and the grain together reweight the premise—extinction acknowledged, attention chosen anyway. Causal chain holds: impact → lichen → oxidation → chemical stall → photograph → descent, each because/therefore legible. The hourglass grain pays off as the constraint that keeps her watching instead of collecting. Cost is unmistakable in the last line: “carrying with her the proof that something extraordinary had once burned quietly…”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Regolith crunch, bioluminescent crackle, and the moonlit color shift are filtered through Maren’s professional eye, guiding every micro-choice. The summit’s exotic chemistry literally constrains her tactic—she paints neutralizer into the very fractures she stands on. Spatial choreography is flawless: switchback, rim, tripod, vial, descent. Micro-setting (vial on base plate) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“photograph the last” —is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when oxidation outruns taxonomy. One meaningful turn: the decision to paint the rock instead of sampling it narrows her option from preservation to delay. Cost is the year she gambles and the certainty she surrenders. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; a second tightening beat would push this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring equation of vigilance vs. vanishing: hourglass grain, chemical letter, camera exposure. Final image reweights the premise—value is located not in saving but in refusing to look away. Subtext is carried by objects rather than exposition; no character states the moral. A hairline slip: “dawnlit melancholy” edges toward label, but the closing sentence’s particulate specificity redeems it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual bias—she notices minerals, fracture widths, exposure times. Syntax lengthens under calm, compresses under urgency (“She capped the vial, stowed the chemical kit, folded the tripod”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. The lyric register is earned by her vocation; elevated diction (“charcoal stone,” “nebula seen from within”) remains within a scientist’s metaphoric range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hike: long sentences climb, short sentences crest. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or stake. Figurative language is sparse and precise; only two metaphors in 90 seconds of exposure, both physically accurate. Meets the 9+ quick test flawlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent lichen feeding on impact chemistry is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of extinction biology and cosmic debris. Risk is taken by making the climax a refusal to harvest rather than a last-second rescue, yet causality holds. The hourglass grain re-contextualizes the extinction trope into personal time-keeping—an angle not templated in cli-fi. One decimal off only because the father anecdote is a familiar “parent gift” device; its materiality saves it from cliché but not fully.</comment>
