<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyric but remains anchored to the mirror’s tilt and shutter choreography; the “spiralingly calm” trait is shown through micro-gesture, not label. Cost is present—the boy’s softened shoulders, her renunciation of speech—but the stakes never escalate beyond quiet recognition, so the endurance reads as graceful rather than wrenching. Still, motives stay consistent and the final shared breathing cadence is embodied, not declared.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrored coin of light and synchronized breath reconfigure loneliness into wordless company at visible cost (mirror lowered, lantern unlit). Accumulative lens holds—pattern builds by shutter adjustments and reflected gleams until the final image crystallizes meaning. Causality is internal but coherent; no orientation debt. Could edge 9.0 if one incremental choice had sharper forfeiture.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet planks, canal stillness, and the dental mirror’s gleam are returned as tools that constrain angle, reflection, and finally communion. Spatial logic is immaculate—every shutter tilt is tracked and re-seen across water. Weather and wood texture feed the hush that enables the pairing; environment is indivisible from tactic. High-band gate met: setting charges the final image.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness versus recognition—tightens once when the lantern boy appears; the constellation’s creation is the deepening beat under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt but moderate: mirror relinquished, words still withheld. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping escalation lyrical; sufficient for sub-800-word form yet shy of the visible price needed for 8.5+.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: darkness as canvas, light as syllabic punctuation, silence as weave. No explicit thesis; final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains fertile—reader must decide whether recognition heals or merely pauses loneliness—yielding complexity within brevity. Almost 9.0; nuance would sharpen if shutter pattern had one failed earlier iteration.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her tactile perceptions; diction is weather-soaked, rhythmic, and consistent. Filter verbs serve voice (“she studied the way a weaver studies a loom”). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Mirror’s metallics and canal’s ironwet air create a singular perceptual signature. High-band control with zero head-hop.</comment>  

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; metaphors mingle water, textiles, language without contradiction. Information density high—one line often does description, metaphor, and causality. No loops, scaffold, or thesaurus drift. Read-aloud rhythm supports hush and swell. Closure line is clean, image-driven, artifact-free. Exemplary line-level craft at this length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar ingredients—mute mentor, wounded child, found constellation—are re-cast through dental-mirror optics and architectural semaphore. Conceptual risk (teaching darkness to read stars via neglect) is fully committed to and paid off. Specificity of dock wood iron smell and shutter angles prevents template drift. Not revolutionary, but synthesis feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Setup and payoff strong; middle development modest—her pattern-weave is active but boy’s arrival is observational, not forced choice. Still, the final shared breath depends on her prior silence and mirror discipline. Cost legible in lowered mirror. Could ascend to 8+ with one denied alternative tactic mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mirror appears early, steers two beats (angled reflection onto planks, final pocketing), and reweights meaning at closure. Its small round glass converts warehouse decay into private cosmos and literally courts the boy. Irreplaceable prop; removal collapses both tactic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Concept shapes action: silence is the medium through which pattern and recognition occur. Enables the boy’s approach without speech and charges the closing stillness. Not aggressively conflicted, but consistently influences tactics and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Trait enables precise shutter adjustments and withheld speech; cost is opportunity for quicker rapport. Spiraling control is dramatized in repeated micro-tilts of mirror and slats, not merely declared. Middle development present but brief; still sufficient for high-mid integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Weaving is the central beat sequence—shutters into constellation, light into sentence. Without it, no pattern, no reflection, no invitation to the boy. Appears in setup, develops across paragraph, and informs closure image. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Method is taught early, executed step-by-step, and echoed in mirrored surface; mechanics determine visibility from dock. Failure to adjust angles would break recognition beat. Present at all three gates with visible specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-rain slickness enables mirror-coin glide and footbridge crossing; cobalt hue feeds celestial motif. Setting’s damp silence pressures the hush that allows non-verbal connection. Integral across beats and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Phrase sets mood but never constricts available minutes or forces quicker choice; time remains loose and impressionistic. Serves tone more than tactic, limiting score to mid-band despite poetic appeal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Motive declared yet dramatized—each shutter tilt is a syllabic lesson, mirror gleam the punctuation. Conflict light: darkness both resists and enables her pedagogy. Cost is solitude maintained while teaching. Strong integration, though could edge higher if one beat showed pattern mis-read by night.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stillwater tension permeates syntax, pacing, and canal surface; modulates when light coin skids across planks, then settles into synchronized breathing. Tone directly charges the final Charged Poise. Coherent and indispensable to resonance.</comment>
