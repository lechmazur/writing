<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s grief is embodied and character-specific—palming the glass eyes, kneeling on the chipped mosaic. The conjuring trial is a micro-choice that externalises her refusal to close the loss-account, giving us active interiority. The climactic realisation (“the mathematics of emotion did not resolve. They iterated.”) lands as earned renunciation because every tactile beat has fed that asymptote image. A hair more contradiction-in-scene rather than expository summary would push it into the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spell fails to locate Elda yet crystallises Maren’s future path—“tomorrow she would return to the deeper passages.” Cost is legible in the extinguished eyes and the tightened, still-ambiguous equation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of iterated loss tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is complete by line 9; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is vivid and selective—moon-column, mineral-sweet fruit, calcite-rooted trees—all filtered through a conjurer’s secrecy. The mosaic stepping-stone’s chipped absences physically constrain the spell and reappear in the closure glow, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean as Maren kneels, places the eyes, and rises. Only the brief “architecture of her skull” phrase drifts toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove/disprove ambiguous loss—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens once when the spell’s hum reframes the equation without resolution. The cost is the extinguished glass eyes and the iterated asymptote that forecloses tidy grief. Agency belongs to Maren throughout; no convenient external solve. A crisper material loss (broken lantern, frost-bitten fingers) would have pushed the felt price into 8.8 territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the iterative spell: grief as an asymptote, not an answer. The glass eyes reweight from “return what death borrowed” to “socket filled with seeing yet still dark,” offering resonant non-literal closure. No overt thesis statements—insight is earned via tactile particulars. Final image of moon-reliant growth keeps ambiguity alive without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a hushed, mineral cadence that matches subterranean secrecy. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, tightens during spell-craft (“Numbers surfaced… better questions”), mirroring pressure. Distinct perceptual signature—orchard read by feel, mathematics of emotion—never leaks into explanatory exposition. Filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and propulsive; every sentence pulls double duty (image + emotion or setting + theme). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Metaphors stay coherent—“asymptote shaped like her sister’s face.” A single mixed image (“congregants frozen mid-prayer”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched. Read-aloud rhythm modulates effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The taxidermist-glass-eye / mathematical-grief fusion feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template replicates that pairing. Subterranean moon-orchard is highly specific, constraining spell logic and emotional tone. Risk in the iterative non-resolution pays off: refusal of binary found/lost reconfigures reader expectations. Transformation is complete—swapping names or setting would collapse the core metaphor.</comment>
