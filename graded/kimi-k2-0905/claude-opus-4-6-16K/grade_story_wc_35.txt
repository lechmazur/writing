<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-tasting gift and the seven-minute guilt are viscerally embodied; the renunciation to “carry, not cure” is earned through the sub-zero absorption scene. Interiority stays concrete—salt in fingernails, cold climbing forearms—without diagnostic labels. The only slack: the daughter’s death is recounted, not dramatized, so the memory lacks the sensory punch the gift promises.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tasted memory layers density until the single tightening—hands on coral—reweights the stake from private agony to shared archive. Closure is a Charged Poise: ice seals her spiral with others, cost legible in “unsteady legs.” Orientation clean by 120 words; no因果 breaks. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Desert fortress weeping rain, salt-stained palms, and the impossible ice-coral pavilion are tactile, selective, and mirror interior thaw/freeze cycles. The pavilion’s tidal pools act as micro-setting that literally receives her body and memory—constraint that charges the final image. Weather and architecture guide every move; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“sandpaper rough memories into swallowable”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative saturation: each absorbed grief increases risk of erasure; the final immersion forecloses solitude, price paid in numb limbs. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Cost is visible, persistent, and shapes tomorrow’s cooking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: grief is communal archive, not private wound. Subtext lives in salt/coral binaries—preservation vs. accretion. Final image of “shared weight” reconfigures the opening salt bowl without moralizing. One near-miss: “grief was not a thing to cure but a thing to carry” edges toward thesis-statement, but saved by embodied cost moments earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s synesthetic palate; perceptual signature is gustatory, never generic. Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences during absorption, clipped ascent at exit—mirroring temperature shift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are few and motivated (“tasted,” “traced”) rather than explanatory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water traced the cracks…like tears following old scars” performs both setting and metaphor in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“coral…sharp and branching, cutting her from the inside”—but physical logic holds because grief is literally crystalline inside her. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + desert ice reliquary is a fresh synthesis; neither trope feels grafted. The inversion of culinary nurture into grief ingestion reweights vocation as affliction. Conceptual risk—frozen coral beneath dunes—commits fully, never explained away. Transformation test fails if relocated to temperate climate; setting is irreplaceable.</comment>
