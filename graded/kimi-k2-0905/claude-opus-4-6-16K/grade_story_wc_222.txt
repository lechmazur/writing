<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s fear-shaken resolve and “theft” of the cipher back into safety land as credible, embodied choices; the final descent with “hands still shaking” sells cost. Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. Yet her chivalrous-thief identity is asserted, not dramatized—no beat shows her stealing-to-return outside the chess reset—so motivation tops out at strong, not exemplary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is lucid: wrong sky → climb → disturbed board → lid-corrected cipher → stars re-anchored. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she restores cosmic order but leaves Oduin lost and herself descending into fresh uncertainty. The lid’s earlier gifting is briefly sketched yet sufficiently cued; no orientation gap. One causal jump—how sky-reorder immediately follows the king’s click—keeps it from flawless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spire, observatory, and hollow pieces are tactile, cold, and altitude-affecting; the chess set doubles as micro-setting that steers every move. Selective sensory triage under stress (numb fingers, cracked ice singing) keeps description purposeful. Sky shift is vivid but physically ungrounded—no sense of horizon or temperature change—so environment stops just short of charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent weaponization of secrets—surfaces by line 6 and tightens when the cipher is found scrambled. Single reversal: restoring the board forecloses her escape-with-secrets option and commits her to unknown reprisal; price is the groaning spire and her shaken descent. Pressure is coherent but static—no counter-force beyond implied off-screen antagonist—so escalation is present, not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of attention-as-courage emerges through action: she literally re-orders the heavens by looking, choosing, acting. Sacred play (chess/game) fuses with mortal stakes without sermon. Final image of steady stars above trembling hands leaves resonant ambiguity—order restored yet personal cost unpaid. No moralizing, just reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter—cold, altitude, weight of ivory—syntax tightening as air thins. Phrasing (“scoop them like dice,” “sacredly playful grin”) is character-specific, not ornamental. No head-hop or register drift. Voice under peak stress compresses cleanly: “Tonight they shook badly.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: volcanic-glass table, hollow pieces, brass lid each do double duty. Rhythm breathes—long climb sentences contract into staccato piece swaps. One scaffold loop: “She swapped…/Moved…/Each piece she lifted…” three near-identical syntactic fronts in five lines (−0.3). Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Star-reordering chess cipher feels fresh, not borrowed; the notion that constellations are a mutable message encoded in a game is a striking synthesis. Familiar mentor-apprentice arc is revitalized through the “theft” of resetting rather than stealing. Risky cosmic scale is earned by concrete micro-actions. Could verge on gimmick but grounds in Maren’s embodied cost.</comment>
