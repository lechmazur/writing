<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The boy’s withheld revelation is credibly rooted in reverse-lived experience; Maren’s shift from terror to acceptance is embodied through her translucent hand reaching into starlight. Interior contradiction—he teaches by not teaching—drives the scene. Cost is visible: her fear is not “cured” but reframed, foreclosing denial. Voice convergence is acceptable at the quiet climax; micro-choices (tossing stones, open palm) encode hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “arrival” reweights vanishing with undeniable cost—she must live translucent. Causal chain withheld→rings→revelation holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; ripple pattern taught early and recalled in final image. Orientation anchored by word 40; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint—iron-rich basalt slowing thought—shapes pacing and final stillness. Cost legible in last line: light already passing through her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto, floating rock, and mineral-starred ceiling are not backdrop but tacit antagonist: basalt pulls iron, slows cognition, enables trance. Micro-setting (Maren’s glassy hand) acts as lens for starlight, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy服从POV: boy notices ripples, Maren notices transparency. Spatial choreography clean; platform, pond, walls remain consistently placed. Environment constrains choice—no exit, only altered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fear of disappearance—signaled in first 120 words. Single tightening: transparency past wrist → reframing as doorway. Agency resides in attention shift, not external victory; renunciation of cure narrative carries felt cost. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: each stone’s ripples deepen trance until stance crystallizes. No coincidence; magnetic grotto complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—disappearance as arrival—emerges through ripple imagery rather than assertion. Subtext operates in silence: boy withholds, Maren reaches. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing; ambiguity lingers (where is she arriving?). No motif checklist; stones and transparency recur because they constrain perception and choice. Insight earned via embodied trance, not dictum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited flexes focal depth: boy’s ancient calm, Maren’s terror filtered through starlight on glassy flesh. Perceptual signature distinct—boy clocks ripple geometry, Maren tracks transparency creep. Syntax mirrors pressure: longer clauses during trance, fragment-like tosses at stone beats. No head-hop; distance stable. Free indirect clean: “She called it terror” stays within her idiom.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. High density: “basalt walls pulled gently at the iron in his blood” fuses setting, physics, and slowed cognition. Rhythm varies naturally; short tosses interrupt lyrical drift. Metaphors consistent—rings, honey, lantern—without muddle. No filter-verb clusters. Final line breathes, propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Reverse-aging mentor + disappearing syndrome feels fresh, synthesized through magnetic grotto physics rather than trope mash-up. Ripple-as-teaching-device is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in withholding cure pays off: no last-minute magic, only perceptual flip. Specificity—iron in blood, figure-eight ripples—grounds concept. Could not swap names/places without destroying logic.</comment>
