<comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her contradiction—dreaming within data—animates every beat. The final choice is rooted in her maps and models, so causality is intact. Yet the emotional cost is only implied; no bodily shock or forfeiture lands on the page, keeping her just shy of the 8-band where felt cost is required for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The causal arc is clean: eleven years of mapping → convergence zones → single-page mandate → final dive of the quill. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the future is literally redirected. The lens holds; no teleporting data or retro-fixes appear. Minor waiver: the “kingfisher dove” image is abstract, but under lyrical closure rules it reweights the premise, so cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and wall of ignorance maps are not backdrop—they funnel her attention and physically host the mandate ritual. Micro-setting wins: the nib’s glint on obsidian, the lake’s black mirror, charge the final image. Environment constrains: she must write now, here, one page. Only absence of temperature sensation on her body keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—what unknowns deserve ten years of talent—is signaled early and tightened by the one-page constraint. Escalation is conceptual: each blank zone on the maps narrows her options until only three convergence zones remain. Agency is pure decision inside her head, but the cost is institutional: entire disciplines will rise or languish. The absence of a visible personal price (she does not bleed, sweat, or lose tenure) caps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating shape of absence—white spaces on maps—rather than authorial statement. The final image (kingfisher diving) reweights the premise: precision is violence against ignorance. No moral is preached; the reader is left to feel the river under ice. The concept of “writing the future” is dramatized, not labeled, giving clean resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is geologist-precise, cold, compressed: “cataloging the borders of human understanding.” Syntax mirrors her scalpel mind—short clauses, metal verbs. Perceptual signature holds: she sees fatigue as unmapped territory. Only a single register drift—“generative investments” slides into policy jargon—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is scaffold-free; no loops, no filter stacks. Figurative control is surgical: “black needle,” “river beneath ice” extend metaphor once each, then exit. Information density is high—one sentence often carries setting, interior, and conceptual move. The final line’s monosyllabic plunge—“the kingfisher dove”—earns rhythmic closure without artifact, missing 9 only because earlier paragraphs occasionally over-alliterate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The ignorance-cartographer profession is a fresh angle; the mandate-as-single-page constraint is a brilliant engine. Convergence zones (neurology ↔ materials science etc.) feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk: the entire climax is internal, yet the concept sells it. Transformation test fails—this could only happen here, now, to her.</comment>
