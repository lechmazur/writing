<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—filial loyalty vs. moral disgust—are alive in the prep-room silence; her micro-choice to cradle the ink pot while mapping the “mathematics of a fair trade” shows embodied cost. Desmond’s shift from reflexive smile to “calculating a fair price” is credibly forced by her blackmail, not an unearned epiphany. The final “Okay” carries visible cost: he surrenders thirty years of grift logic. One slip: “something colder” is diagnostic label-speak that could be more viscerally shown.</comment>

<comment>Causal spine holds: discovery of file → phone call to consulate → midnight ultimatum → father’s capitulation, each beat tightening options. The ink pot acts as both emotional anchor and bargaining chip, reweighted at closure when Desmond cradles it—visible cost. Mid-scene orientation is swift (17-yr-old daughter, prep room, midnight). No outline drift; every sentence advances position or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prep-room details—formaldehyde/lavender, steel stool, embalming table—are filtered through Mara’s habituated disgust and constrain her ability to breathe normally, mirroring moral suffocation. The ink pot’s Czech cobalt glaze is micro-setting that dictates the final leverage beat. Spatial choreography clean: door opens, father sits across table, object placed between them. Weather cue (rain on coat) adds texture without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—force father to execute real asylum—signals early and escalates through Mara’s blackmail; the 200k becomes the price of Desmond’s survival. One meaningful tightening: “If you don’t, I turn over your files…” forecloses evasion. Cost is legible in Desmond’s exposed jaw tension and the single whispered “Okay.” Agency stays hers; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of equitable exchange emerges from the con’s arithmetic inverted: the scam money must now buy the very truth it faked. Ink pot motif (honest object in house of lies) reappears at closure to reweight meaning without moralizing. Final image of “math…balanced” offers conceptual repricing. No tidy thesis stated—ambiguity lingers on whether Desmond will stay altered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual bias: she smells through formaldehyde, notices rain on his coat, hears humming lights. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She had waited actively…”—and loosens slightly in reflective paragraphs, matching chess-player patience. No head-hop; Desmond’s interior is read only through his jaw and hands. Dialogue sparse but carries subtext (“That’s not how this works” = entire life philosophy).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high-density lines (“architecture of consequence”) coexist with stripped declarations (“Okay”). No filter-verb stacks or loops. One mixed metaphor—“architecture of consequence” beside “mathematics of a fair trade”—is allowable because both motifs recur and payoff. Opening and final lines are sharp, propulsive, and free of scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “honest child of crook” trope by placing negotiation inside a funeral prep room and making the moral leverage a dried-up ink pot. Asylum scam angle gives geopolitical urgency seldom paired with small-scale filial blackmail. Risk: Mara’s triumph could feel neat, but the cost to Desmond (exposure, surrender of identity) keeps it from symmetric satisfaction. Details—Moldovan brother, cobalt glaze—are specific enough to prevent swap-out.</comment>
