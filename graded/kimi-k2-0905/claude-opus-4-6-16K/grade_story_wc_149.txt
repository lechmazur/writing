<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority—her dawning recognition that the orchard is a love-offering she once planted—rides embodied micro-choices (pruning, narrating aloud, finally opening her palm). The contradiction between her modern solitude and inherited memory is kept in scene, not abstracted. The ghost bride’s presence, though off-page for most beats, still applies pressure via warmth of the bead, scent, light-bloom—enough to register as relationship-under-pressure. Cost lands in the bead’s sudden coldness and the irrevocable retreat of night; renunciation is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early (repetition of “winter-cracked fields,” each fruit-light glimpse) and tightens into a single cadence shift at the simultaneous blossom/constellation eruption. Orientation anchors inside 120 words: Maren, greenhouse, third night. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—night thins, bead cools—visible cost paid. One minor scaffold: “over the hush…” phrase repeated at open and close; since it frames accrual rather than stalls, deduction stays minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass fog, mercury pomegranates, stone runnels—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Maren’s alchemical task-attention. The greenhouse itself supplies the final image’s lighting and constraints; the carved bead functions as micro-setting that charges the last touch. Spatial choreography stays clean across apparitions. The repeated “winter-cracked fields” risks postcard echo, but its return at thinning darkness reweights it, giving functional payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: remembering/accepting a trans-lifetime love before endless night swallows the orchard. Pressure accrues through lengthening apparitions and bead heat; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening—Maren’s narration aloud—narrows her stance from passive caretaker to reciprocal lover. Cost is rendered in ghost’s disappearance and bead’s chill, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love as cyclical cultivation emerges via grafting/blossoming imagery rather than statement. Subtext resides in the orchard’s impossible fruit: nourishment extracted from poison mirrors love refined through death. No final moralizing; last whisper reweights prior material without abstraction. “Lovingly venomous” smile and frost/fire touch keep ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited keeps tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors metallics, luminescence, and alchemical lexis. Rhythm swells into long breathless sentence at blossom eruption, then collapses into short declaratives as bride vanishes—intentional modulation. No dialogue, so voice purity remains uncontested. Compression (“centuries of exhalation”) is taught in first paragraph and stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action plus atmospheric charge—with only one paraphrase loop (“winter-cracked fields”). Metaphors stay coherent within alchemical register; no mixed vehicles. Opening clause fog/edge alignment efficiently anchors. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to breathe”) is marginally cushioned by POV uncertainty, not enough to mar closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reincarnation debt paid through botanic alchemy feels non-obvious; greenhouse-as-love-letter reverses haunt trope. Transformation test fails if you swap setting—these trees must bleed mercury to justify centuries of waiting. Risk in lyric accrual pays off: night’s retreat earned, not asserted. No close genre echo; ashen-veil bride remains folkloric yet specific to this voice.</comment>
