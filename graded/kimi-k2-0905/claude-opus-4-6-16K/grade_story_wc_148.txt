<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s inherited incredulity and the need to be believed drive every beat; the nightly carving of testimony embodies the cost of endurance. Contradictory impulses—hope that the tide will expose the bodies vs. despair that no one will read his grooves—coexist in-scene. The final stance of continued confession, foreclosed absolution, is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each copperlight return and each new scuff thickens the pattern until the tower itself becomes a sealed affidavit. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lattice, the beam, the carved door crystallize the stakes; the cost is lifelong imprisonment in testimony. No causality breaks; orientation anchored inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse, reef, confessional lattice, and scuffed door filter every perception; the lattice constrains voice literally, the door records it physically. Copperlight reappears to re-weight the same stones, making environment an active co-witness. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—credibility vs. erasure—tightens through ritual repetition: each sunset adds one carved line, winter storms one step closer to exhumation. Agency is the act of enduring inscription; no external reversal, but the accruing evidence narrows possibility of forgiveness to zero. Cost is legible in the growing tally on the door.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of testimony versus disbelief emerges through material acts—carving, whispering, waiting—never assertion. Final image re-prices silence: the hush after confession remains wind-filled, proving truth alone grants no absolution. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical, compressed diction mimics a mind pacing a spiral cell; patterned repetition of copperlight/scuff/lattice teaches rhythm early and pays off in closing cadence. Perceptual signature is obsessive, tactile, maritime—no head-hop, no register drift. Voice scales naturally under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density, vivid metaphor grounded in POV; occasional slight modifier stacks (“amber flood… cathedral”) flirt with excess but serve beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar. Rhythm breathes with daylight rotation—prose accelerates at dusk, slows at nightfall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Inverting the boy-who-cried-wolf legend into the son who tells truth but is still disbelieved gives fresh moral torque. Lighthouse-as-confessional, carving testimony into prior prisoners’ scars, feels inevitable yet unvisited. Specificity of copperlight and seagrass hair lifts the piece above allegory.</comment>
