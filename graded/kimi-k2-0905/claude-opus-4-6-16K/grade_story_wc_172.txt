<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory calculus—eleven thousand displacements vs. one extinct call—is dramatized through embodied micro-choices (kneeling, setting the egg, walking away). The final renunciation of sentimentality carries visible cost: she leaves the egg and her absolution behind. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, “vestigial” and “arithmetic of sin” keep flaw sharp. Voice stays singular, but the absence of on-page opposition caps her at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drought fractures → salt-flat arrow → speaker-loop. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. Closure is Charged Poise: egg left as sentinel, call looping eternally—conceptual cost undeniable (“something that could not be taken away”). Persistent constraint: the arriving rain will erase the map but not the sound, reweighting all prior cruelty into lament.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt-flat crystals function as micro-setting: they refract light onto the egg, guide her knee placement, and will be washed away by the storm. Cracked riverbeds as “cartography of thirst” is specific, lived, causal. Sensorial hierarchy—white glare, low thunder, thermal foam—mirrors internal austerity. The egg’s pale blue against salt white charges the final image; removing it collapses the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can a conscience purchase permanence for a vanished voice? One tightening: the map of cracks converges on the exact egg placement—her agency literalizes the arrow. Cost is legible: eleven thousand lives traded for an eternal loop she will never hear again. No reversal needed; the ethical crater is the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of conservation-through-genocide; no sentence preaches. Final image reprises the night-heron’s call as “fractured and graceful,” reweighting drought,算术, and abandonment into mournful resonance. Subtext in her refusal to look back: the only memorial she can bear is auditory, not visual. Complexity held: reader complicity is implicated without moral spoon-feeding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Detached, clinical diction—“carbon-fiber case,” “thermal foam,” “fourteen million dollars”—mirrors her emotional austerity yet stays within POV lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for satellite imagery, staccato for egg placement. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent (“sky bruised with clouds that refused to weep”). Compression in final paragraph—“Let it come”—is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence performs double duty (salt flat = mirror + altar). No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (“cartography of thirst”). Final line—“she let it”—earns breath after propulsive syntax. Minor −0.1 for “pigment that had faded to the faintest bronze” (slight modifier stack), but does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise flips eco-restoration trope into eco-murder-for-memory, a synthesis not seen in slush. Night-heron egg as relic + speaker array as eternal choir is a fresh material culture. Risk of unsympathetic protagonist is embraced; no safety-hedging relief. Removing salt-flat map or egg breaks the story’s logic; hence high specificity and non-obviousness.</comment>
