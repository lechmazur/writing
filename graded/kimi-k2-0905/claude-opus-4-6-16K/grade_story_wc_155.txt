<comment>Luma’s interiority is vivid—her “small, pensive laugh” and the moment she “felt the old delight return” show embodied, contradictory emotion. The causality of her artistic paralysis → orchard quest → light-painting is clean and character-bound. Yet the shift from private grief to public sharing relies on an epiphanic leap (“Joy…needed to be shared”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her something concrete on the page. Still, the endurance of the fresco fragment and the visible glow she projects give her arc an Earned Stasis that feels proportionate to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the projected orchard is decisively temporary, the battery will die, and that impermanence is the felt cost reweighting her earlier despair. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (fog, calcium, flashlight, projector) deepens the stake of “exposed film” until the final floating petals. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. The only slack is the off-stage “knowledge network” upload that resolves the external legacy—minor, but it slightly blunts the causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fog is not backdrop; it scatters her projections and literally makes the light-painted blossoms drift in mid-air, constraining her display and charging the final image. The calcium-veined fresco fragment is handled twice—first as ruin, then as the anchor for her projection—so the micro-setting (fragment-as-wall) drives the turning beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: mineral-sweet fog taste, wet stone scent, flashlight beam caught in droplets. One minor spatial glitch: “sat on a pile of rubble” directly after roofless walls—“pile” could be sharper, but it never confuses choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where joy went”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens when the fresco fragment surfaces. The meaningful deepening is the daydream vision that reconfigures her options: from passive grief to active light-painting. Cost is legible but diffuse: the orchard will vanish at dawn, the battery will die; a more concrete forfeiture (battery drain mid-process, risking total darkness) would have lifted this into 8+ band. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: beauty as civic duty that can’t be hoarded. The exposed-film concept is woven through action rather than thesis—her projector literally needs the fog’s diffusion to make the orchard float. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “quiet, like a tree deciding…to bloom” is a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo penalties; no platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is strong: “licking a wet stone,” “sensitive surfaces waiting to be struck,” “fog pooled inside the walls like milk in a bowl.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, image-stacked sentences during projection; short, stunned fragments when she laughs. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Register stays within an artist’s plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: every sentence advances character, image, or atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors per high-pressure beat, both paid off (“exposed film,” “milk in a bowl”). No synonym churn or template cadence. One near-loop: “slowly, then all at once” is a stock phrase, but it’s brief and early enough to avoid closure contamination. Opening and final lines are ear-tested and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of fog-as-projection-screen + fresco fragment + exposed-film metaphor feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Light-painting in ruined orchard is a risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes. The conceptual integrity—beauty as temporary, shareable light—commits fully. Minor deduction for the familiar “artist blocked → ruins → epiphany” spine, but the sensory specificity and networked-archive twist transform the trope.</comment>
