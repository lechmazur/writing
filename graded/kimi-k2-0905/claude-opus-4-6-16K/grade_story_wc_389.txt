<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s decade-long isolation and her reflexive micro-choice to reverse the arrays and speak back give a credible, embodied arc; the final “beans & dawn” shrug shows earned cost. Interiority stays particular—she anthropomorphises weather patterns and swears at cans—yet the causal leap that “someone down in the muck” has an identical receiver is asserted, not shown, softening motivation at the pivotal race beat. Flaws (bitterness, hoarding prophecy) actively complicate her tactics, satisfying 9+ quick test despite the off-stage twin receiver gap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density increases until Elara reweights prophecy from “leash” to “seed catalog,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—she is still alone, eating cold beans while the continent forks. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words; causality remains intact under the lens, though the single beat jump to “someone down there has a receiver” is a mild teleport that keeps the score sub-9. Closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost: open futures purchased by her own indefinite solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt portico and storm-lit peak constrain every tactical move—she builds the station around the singing glass, then weaponises its hum to out-broadcast the prophet. Sensory triage matches crisis: lightning taste and star-weeps narrow to the cold tin can at the end. Micro-setting (the glass) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. One minor drift: altitude weather vs. “permanent thunderheads” could freeze the dome, but the piece hand-waves insulation without credibility break.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“who gets to write the next dawn”—is clear early; pressure tightens when Elara realises the shadows serve any taker and she flips her rig from listener to broadcaster, narrowing her own safety. The beat costs her secrecy and whatever collective future she might have joined, a visible price under Accumulative escalation. No reversal or antagonist beyond the abstract prophet, but the deepening choice forecloses her withdrawn certainty and rewrites continental possibilities, meeting the 8.8+ bar for on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: prophecy as open-source horticulture rather than fate’s collar. Subtext resides in metallic tastes, canned food, and the final star-wheel shrug—no explicit thesis. “Seed catalog” reprises earlier agricultural fragments, reweighting meaning with conceptual cost. The piece resists moral binaries: both prophet and astronomer garden the unknown, yet neither is vindicated, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is thick, sardonic, scientifically mythic—“lightning learned to sing,” “gravel dipped in honey”—with rhythmic compression that never loses clarity. Perceptual signature filters cosmos through solder-burned fingers and bean-can pragmatism. No dialogue to test, yet free-indirect slips are clean. Under stress, diction fragments (“storm-lit and alone and finally understood”) while syntax stays controlled, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus causal push—and rhythm breathes with beats. Figurative layers are dense but purposeful; pattern taught early (“cobalt hummed”) pays off at closure. One scaffold loop: “listened… listening… listen” inside 80 words drags slightly. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; minor loop keeps sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synthesises Clarke-style ancient tech, Appalachian radio gospel, and punk DIY astronomy into an inevitable fable about open-source futurity. “Variant allegiance” flips the trope of oracular destiny without gimmickry. Risky lyric density is held by concrete engineering details—solder, surplus arrays, cans—making abstraction visceral. Feels specific to this narrator and this peak; swap any part and the fable collapses.</comment>
