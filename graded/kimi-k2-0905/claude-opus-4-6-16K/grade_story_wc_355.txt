<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s pacifist refusal to force the diary open is embodied, costly, and drives every beat; the micro-choice to listen instead of break crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—tears “with frequencies,” palm pressed to leather—never sliding into label-speak. The arc’s renunciation is earned: three hundred prior silences prime the final forgiveness, and the price (permanent unknowability of Petra’s words) is felt in the last image. Only the sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics bullets are N/A; interior contradiction is vivid but once—no second layered impulse—keeping the score just outside the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a pristine Earned Stasis: Maren rewinds the tape, embracing an unbroken clasp whose secrecy now carries the weight of Petra’s apology. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each catalogued silence thickens the final resonance—and the conceptual cost (she will never read the words) is legible in “ready to listen again… until the silence felt less like loss.” Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no teleporting props; the diary’s arrival six weeks earlier is the single, necessary backstory fragment. One tightening only, but it is decisive, and the fireworks’ external countdown satisfies the on-page price test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The roofless workshop is no postcard: stars pour onto benches, tuning forks glint, and the contact microphone’s cable literally tethers Maren’s body to the diary during the climax. Sensory hierarchy mirrors pacifist priorities—sound over sight, hush over glare—guiding her choice to listen, not look. The seashell labeled “ocean’s apology” sits beside the diary in the final image, recharging the maritime distance motif with closure cost. Micro-setting (the diary’s leather skin as resonant cavity) constrains the tactical method, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“recover Petra’s silence”—is signaled in paragraph six and tightens once: the lost silence is found inside an unbreakable clasp, forcing a non-violent tactic that reweights the evening from cataloguing to forgiving. Agency is continuous: sweep oscillator, press mic, label tape, rewind again. The price—permanent textual silence—escalates under Accumulative lens rather than causal reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices. No external antagonist needed; the clasp itself is the irreversible constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: empathy is practiced by honoring what cannot be opened. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of rewound tape beside seashell reweights every prior silence as surrogate sibling presence. Subtext resides in gesture—hand on locked leather, tears as frequency—never in exposition. The refusal to moralize keeps complexity alive: Petra may still be unforgiven in words, yet forgiven in silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual signature—singing bowls, vacuum-tube earring, silence as texture—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under emotional load (“heavy and clean at the same time…”) then shortens at peak beat (“She recorded… She labeled…”) mirroring breath control. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are N/A. Patterned elision (“three summers ago…”) is taught early and paid off in the roofless payoff, keeping experimental tolerance intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: one sentence often carries image, metaphor, and causal nudge (“Paper remembers pressure. Ink leaves weight.”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (curtain rising on empty stage = theatrical sincerity). Register never drifts above Maren’s maker lexicon. A single near-purple line (“stars poured in like witnesses”) survives because it is later recharged when fireworks fail to impress those same stars, so the image earns its slot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—“catalogue silence by listening through locked covers”—is non-obvious and fully committed to; no retreat into normal diary-opening. Risk-taking (roofless workshop, oscillator as stethoscope) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if Maren were a generic collector: pacifist ethic and audio hacker skillset are inseparable. Fresh inflection arrives when fireworks become the foil to curated hush, reconfiguring celebration as intrusion.</comment>
