<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s “noticer” trait is vividly dramatized in her tactile inspection of the cottage wall and her later micro-choice to place the orris shard; the internal contradiction between her compulsion to catalog and her need to intervene is felt on the page. The only slack is that her emotional cost is more implied than embodied—no bodily aftermath registers after the house “takes its first breath.” Still, the renunciation of her treasured fragment is credibly motivated and forecloses her role as mere observer, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the bungalow’s first “hushed blaze” reconfigures the meaning of every prior migration while the orris scent lingers on her fingers as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each displaced object tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the whole bay. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. One persistent constraint—the shard is gone—shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bay’s half-hearted streetlights and spring-swollen water are not backdrop but instruments: their liminal glow cues Maren’s nightly ritual and grants her access to notice. The orris shard itself functions as micro-setting, its violet ghost on her fingers charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—three objects on the sill form a “small congregation” that the camera can track. Environment thus constrains the final placement and recharges the image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens: each discovered migration (porcelain dog, brass knob, marble) tightens the central question until the bungalow beat forces the decisive placement. Cost is legible—the loss of her grandmother’s keepsake—paid on the page. No reversal is needed; the pattern break is the deepening. Stakes stay singular and grow denser rather than louder, satisfying the lens guardrail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges without announcement: sanctification is an unconscious by-product of care, never moralized. The final image of the marble beginning its “long, quiet journey” offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior migration. No echoic thesis line; the insight stays implicit in the hushed blaze. Ambiguity lingers—does the house feel, or do we?—yet feels earned rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “daydreaming streetlights,” “shard of hush,” and the synesthetic violet ghost create a lyric cadence that is taught early and paid off at closure. Compression is purposeful—ellipses like “Unremarkable. But…” control breath under pressure. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to Maren’s notice-filter. Diction never drifts above her quiet, coastal register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for bay description, staccato fragments for revelation. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor time, reveal trait, and advance plot. A single scaffold trace—“the question consumed her”—is too abstract for peak pressure, preventing a full 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sanctification-via-displacement premise feels fresh yet inevitable; no trope template is borrowed. The bay’s “daydreaming” streetlights and the orris shard as “shard of hush” supply particularized imagery that would collapse if relocated. Risk is quiet—no twist, yet the conceptual reprice lands. Slight deduction for the universalizable moral could travel to another setting with minor edits.</comment>
