<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maren’s grief-driven ritual is credibly embodied—her fingers working the ash, the decision to face the mask toward the vanishing point—yet the interior contradiction between preservation and obliteration stays largely asserted rather than dramatized in a single acute beat; the final renunciation lands cleanly under Earned Stasis with visible cost (leaving the mask), satisfying the 9+ quick test boundary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ash-line and abandoned mask reweight “safety” as an impossible convergence; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each scattered handful intensifies the stakes of disappearance—cost is legible in the last sentence (“the way safety always does… vanish”), no causal breaks, orientation anchored by 120 words; minor drift in reflective paragraphs keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The gallery’s impossible perspective is not mere backdrop—it forces Maren’s ritual path and charges the final image; ash motes caught in converging light literally steer her tempo of scattering; the porcelain mask and urn serve as micro-setting that constrains placement; all sensory detail is filtered through her charcoal-trained eye; environment meaningfully shapes tactics, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—crystallize the fleeting emotion between memory and grief—is signaled early; each handful of ash tightens the irreversible commitment under Accumulative lens; the mask’s placement is the visible price; escalation is single-track but sufficient for 800 words; cost is unmistakable on the page, satisfying 8.8+ band requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the vanishing geometry and ash-line rather than statement; the mirage of safety is repriced when Maren walks away, leaving the fractured mask as sentinel; ambiguity between preservation and erasure lingers without moralizing; final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost, meeting the 9- quick test threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—attention to “temperature of grief,” graphite snow—syntax lengthens in reflective beats then compresses during scattering; no head-hop; patterned elision (“the feeling that lasted only as long as ash stayed airborne”) is taught early and paid off, keeping it sub-9 only by a hairline lack of rhythmic risk under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances image or stake; figurative language is selective, never floods a single beat; no loops, scaffold, or register drift; opening line anchors voice, final line resolves by image; minor over-modification in “somber marvel she had no language for” keeps it just below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-point gallery as crematory is a fresh synthesis; porcelain mask built from mother’s destructive seizures transforms familiar grief-memento trope; concept commits fully without late rule-changes; risk in perspective-illusion pays off by reconfiguring stakes; particularity of charcoal ash versus generic dust keeps it from template territory.</comment>
