<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s quietly driven nature is embodied in dawn-to-dusk work, paint-layer choices, and the final sealed postcard; the inherited need to “see what opens in darkness” motivates every beat and is paid for with visible exhaustion and the hidden message itself. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only realized after reflection, keeping her just shy of the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each postcard and paint layer thickens meaning until the final hidden envelope crystallizes the mother-daughter inheritance. Closure is a Charged Poise—amber light holding both darkness and bloom—whose conceptual cost (permanent concealment of the last postcard) is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber glass governs every visual shift and pigment choice; the melting snowline outside tracks interior progress, while the tucked envelope turns the wall itself into a micro-setting that will outlive the artist. Slight over-description of cathedral names keeps it from indispensable constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she grasp why night blooms matter?”—tightens as each postcard forces a new translucence layer; the final sealing of the envelope forecloses further searching, paying a felt price. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the pressure curve is gentle, not sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through layered glass and pigment: honesty requires chosen darkness and patient witness. Final image reweights all prior postcards without moralizing, achieving resonance by showing the hidden message rather than stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual filter—paint viscosity, amber refractions, postcard paper texture—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with long reflective sentences that breathe like brushstrokes, then tighten at the final envelope seal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description advances theme (“petals rendered in layered glass that revealed different images depending on the angle of light” propels both craft and insight). Occasional cadence echo (“layered…layers”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Night-blooming flowers as filial cipher feels fresh; cathedral-glass technique translated into mural pigment offers concrete specificity. Risk lies in quiet accumulation rather than twist, but the synthesis is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
