<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The weaver’s compulsion to measure rather than heal is vivid, embodied, and consistent; her minute calibrations reveal a hierarchy of values. Yet she never actively chooses or refuses—she endures, so the “earned” clause of the 9+ test is only half-met. The woman visitor functions only as a prop; no relationship crucible or status shift occurs. Interiority stays specific and sensory-rich, but the absence of a decisive micro-choice caps the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of “silence shingled higher” reweights the premise, showing the iterative prison is permanent and growing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift carry the cost rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by line 40; no teleporting props or amnesia. The cost is felt but not dramatically forked by a last-beat choice, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight are not backdrop—they constrain: the lamp’s pulse times the ritual, the open ceiling lets starlight serve as the only other illumination, the oxidized walls mirror the weaver’s verdigris brass. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the single continuous scene. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; cold, drip, and moth-wing beats weave into the hush motif. Environment materially shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quantify grief or remain trapped—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accretion: each new stone increases the psychic load and tightens the recursive loop. No reversal or trade-off is forced; instead, density and cadence deepen until the closing image forecloses escape. Cost is present but generalized to the eternal cycle rather than sharpened in a single beat, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated images: fractal recursion = grief without exit; silence shingles = burden accrual. No character states the thesis; meaning is left implicit in the final “shingled higher.” Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether measurement is mercy or violence. The reweighting at the end reconfigures earlier motifs, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but a hair less complexity than top tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings so tightly to the weaver’s perceptions that syntax itself loops and recurses, enacting the premise. Diction—“copper-bright,” “green-gold whispers,” “whalebone held the shape”—is idiosyncratic and sustained. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under pressure. Rhythm accelerates with shorter image bursts during calcification, then lengthens into the final hush, demonstrating purposeful modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, atmosphere, theme—without scaffold or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “shingled hush” extends cleanly across the piece. One paraphrase loop (“weight… heavy… weight”) appears mid-story but does not touch closure. Figurative language is dense yet always patterned, taught early, and paid off; no register drift or filter-verb stacks under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of fractal mathematics with grief-metrology feels freshly non-obvious and fully committed. Risky lyric recursion could have collapsed into gimmick but remains coherent via disciplined pattern teaching. Specificity of bronze oxidation, kerosene flame, and river-silt stones anchors the concept in tactile reality. Transformation test: story fails without the exact loom/calcify rule—proof of organic invention.</comment>
