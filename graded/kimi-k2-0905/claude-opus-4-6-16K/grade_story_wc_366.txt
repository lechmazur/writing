<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Margit’s reticence is never label-speak; every micro-choice—pocketing the sea glass, stacking three east-tilted stones, adding the twelfth-word page—externalizes her guarded tenderness. The contradiction between silence and the need to “bottle safety” is dramatized in scene, not summarized, and the final renunciation costs her the anonymity she guarded for twenty-three years. Interiority stays concrete: “the color of sea glass held to the sun” instead of abstract grief. One hairline slip: “she realized then” momentarily abstracts what the rest of the beat shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the anonymous chain becomes voiced, the sea glass returned, the east-tilted cairn restacked—cost is the loss of perfect silence. Accumulative lens holds: each cairn, note, and transit adds density until the final lamp-relighting reweights Margit’s entire vocation. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“northern chain,” “landing dock”) and pattern is taught early. No causality breaks; even the letter chain’s spread is shown through concrete crate-to-crate transfers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea-salt specificity—“three flat stones tilted east,” “milky green of a held breath”—is filtered through Margit’s professional eye for weight and balance. The lantern room micro-setting constrains the climax: one match, one lens, one sheaf of papers whose collective weight forces her twelfth word. Weather and tool detail (lamp mechanism, brass fittings) guide her choices rather than decorating. Slight over-description of Atlantic “breathing” keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can wordless care survive death and distance?—tightens when Solveig’s cairn is orphaned; each added page raises the risk of exposure. The final lamp outage forces Margit to choose: keep silence or add her voice. Cost is irreversible: once the twelfth word is placed, her anonymity is foreclosed. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but the lens allows it; pressure peaks inside the dark lantern room where the chain is literally illuminated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: tending light is reciprocal, never anonymous. The sea glass migrates from grief token to communal prism, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image—“burning so quietly that only the keepers could tell she was aflame”—offers a non-literal answer: visibility is not the same as being seen. No thematic echo sentences; meaning stays embodied in objects and gestures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Margit’s perceptual signature: stones are read, not interpreted; emotions arrive as color, weight, or temperature. Syntax mirrors her rationed speech—short, declarative, then a lyrical flare when pressure peaks. No head-hopping; even the keepers’ voices are mediated through papers she handles. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical: “ferrying oil, wicks, lenses, letters, and silence” packs five nouns into one cargo. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language spikes only at the climax—“luminescent ache between them”—and is earned by prior restraint. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during the lamp relighting, then exhales with the dawn departure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The cairn-to-letter pipeline flips the familiar “message in a bottle” into a lateral, anonymous lattice; the innovation feels inevitable in hindsight. Reticence as heroic engine rather than character quirk is fresh, and the final inversion—skipper becomes signal—carries conceptual cost. Specificity of maritime lamp logistics keeps the premise from drifting into allegory. Risk is high yet fully executed without gimmickry.</comment>
