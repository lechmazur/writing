<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s solitude-driven interiority is vivid—her eye for dusk, her stone-anchor, her refusal to broadcast the discovery—but the daughter-loss motive is summarized, not dramatized, so the final renunciation, though earned, feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the last shadow drifts free while Lira seals her notebooks, crystallizing the cost of unshareable knowledge; causality holds under an accumulative lens, each clip-comparison adding density until the final image reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The stratosphere library, UV-fed flowers, and wind-turned pages create a coherent micro-world that physically enables her archive and symbolically charges the finale; the river stone’s tactile coolness anchors the speculative frame in lived matter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens incrementally: each paired clip reveals shadows sliding farther, turning abstract pattern into existential threat to private hope; the final notebook closing is the visible trade-off, foreclosing the Loom-route forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the contrail of withheld dreams—hope as a shadow that must stay attached to a single body; the ending refuses to moralize, letting the orphaned bench-shadow silently reprice collective sharing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric distillation stays locked to Lira’s perceptual filter; diction like “petals of a lotus made from glass and reclaimed wood” is poetically heightened yet consistent with her archivist precision, and no filter-verb stacks dull the ascent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with altitude—long sentences at altitude, staccato notebook entries at crisis; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “luminous regret filled the space between her ribs” is compressed, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating library, migrating shadows, and anti-Loom stance synthesize fresh speculative terrain; the notion that shared dreams leach waking desire is non-obvious and pursued to its atmospheric limit, risking lyric obscurity yet landing cleanly.</comment>
