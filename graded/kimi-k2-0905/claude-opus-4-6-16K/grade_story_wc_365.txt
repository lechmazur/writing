<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voss’s interior contradiction—grief-driven compulsion versus forensic detachment—survives the exposition-rich open and crystallises in the shard-driven crossing; her final pivot from passive mapper to active witness is foreshadowed by every micro-choice and paid for with the spent shard and the “solid ballast” realisation. No head-hop or stock therapy-speak, and her sensory-biased worldview is consistent. Could nudge 9+ if we felt the mother’s absence sting on-page earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens declared and held: each shard resonance obeys the 11-day rule, each crossing because/therefore supplies missing data, and the climax delivers a decisive change—Voss now seeks public restitution—with conceptual cost (the cracked shard, the sealed record). The withheld-truth weight is repriced in the final image (“ballast”). Exposition density risks a BRR breach but is anchored to present tactile cues; orientation is clear before 120 words. Closure satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering (nerve-graft texture, drip cadence, coolant stains) keeps the derelict bay alive without museum tour; the shard doubles as micro-setting that constrains the final move. Spatial choreography clean across the tarp, console, viewport. For 9+ the environment would need to actively hinder or enable the closing decision; here it provides atmosphere more than tactical leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover why the record was sealed—tightens with each crossing until the corridor vision forecloses the mother-alive fantasy and reweights Voss’s goal toward accountability. One visible price: the shard fractures, signalling final usability. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence is absent. Could edge 9-territory if a station authority appeared in present time to oppose her exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of erasure as protective sacrifice; the glass shard’s reweighting from keepsake to key to spent cartridge traces the moral arc without explicit statement. Final image (“directions home” now meaning justice route) supplies conceptual repricing. Subtext in the administrator’s threat and mother’s silent exile carries institutional critique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—synesthetic cartography through grafts—remains consistent; diction (“texture, temperature, electromagnetic residue became spatial data”) is precise yet poetic. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective clauses in tarp scene, clipped fragments at shatter exit. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Dialogue fragment is indirect and sub-textual, fitting voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line often performs setting, character bias, and world rule. Metaphors (“skin of the universe”) are sparing and paid off. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) appear in exposition but not in peak beats; no loops or mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop (“weight… heavy… solid ballast”) is acceptable as deliberate motif cadence. Polished for immediate print.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Merging slip-stream portal key with haptic forensic cartography feels fresh; the shard’s cyclic activation supplies built-in tension without deus-gimmick. Emotional core—grief converted to evidentiary quest—grounds the concept. Risk in multiverse peeking is justified because crossings remain observational until the final re-purposing. Not quite 9+ because the administrator antagonist is a familiar bureaucratic villain.</comment>
