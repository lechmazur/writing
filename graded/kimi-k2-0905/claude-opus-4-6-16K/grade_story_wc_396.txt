<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulse—clutching pain as knowledge yet recoiling when she sees herself feared—plays out in the single, embodied gesture of releasing Darvo’s shadow. The cost is immediate and irreversible: she forfeits perfect recall and walks toward the ice “lighter, less certain,” a credible renunciation scaled to the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard, mirrors, and fragment layer sensory and ethical density until the reflected fear re-weights the stake; Maren’s choice to disperse a shadow delivers a legible before/after with conceptual cost. Closure lands cleanly—she forecloses her old method and steps into unmapped terrain—no causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt-tasting apples and lead-lined box constrain Maren’s ritual; the ice-groan cadence mirrors her dawning uncertainty. Final image—“apples hung like small red lanterns against the grey sky”—recharges the orchard as a threshold she must now cross without her archive of pain, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether empathic appropriation is protection or predation—tightens when the mirrors show the cost already paid: fear of the keeper herself. One decisive intensification: releasing the shadow narrows future tactics; felt price is visible in the instant memory gap and her lighter step onto the ice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The question of what empathy may rightfully claim emerges through mirrored reversal rather than authorial assertion. Final orchard-to-ice image re-weights “map empathy onto action” from hoarding to listening, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Detached, tide-drawn rhythm mimics a woman who listens for ice plates and human fracture alike. Syntax lengthens then thins as certainty dissolves—“lighter, less certain”—taught pattern paid off at exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density—“shadows laced her arms in dark filaments…milky opacity that warmed when held”—each noun pulls double duty; zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphor. No artifacts mar the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Empathic hoarding as occupational hazard feels fresh; crystalline scrying via antique mirrors reframes classic trope into ethical instrument. Risk—quiet renunciation instead of external battle—heightens coherence and pays off in the weighted-breath exit.</comment>
