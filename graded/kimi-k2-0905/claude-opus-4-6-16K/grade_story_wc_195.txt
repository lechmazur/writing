<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric’s “hollowed” withdrawal is embodied in pewter-dulled armor and visor-as-mask; the trembling recognition of his own drilled footwork in puppet diagrams converts abstract damage into a micro-choice that justifies stripping each pauldron. The final allegiance vow is earned, but “shivering bliss” and “second skeleton” flirt with therapeutic abstractions that slightly dull the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: program find → recognition → armor-shed → spoken vow → orchard erupts. The Orientation Test is satisfied by the greenhouse anchor within 120 words, and the closure beat—“shape of possibility settled…almost unbearably bright”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (bare face, no strings). One paraphrase loop (“the endless night…fractured into something else—not dawn, but the raw material of dawn”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The breathing soil, mercury pears, and gold-weeping bark are filtered through Aldric’s wartime numbness; every glowing blossom he triggers constrains his next step and charges the final frost-bright image. Environment is indispensable: the greenhouse’s glass ceiling and star-alphabet directly shape the vow and the dawn-possibility payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the hollowed knight re-engage with life?—is signaled early and tightened once: the program forces a public-private choice to unsnap armor or remain hidden. Escalation is single but decisive; cost is visible (bare terrified face). Could edge higher if an intermediate obstacle had tested the vow before the final flourish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-surrender emerges via puppet-ritual transposed onto flesh; no moral is stated. The reprise of “strings” versus “no strings now” reweights the premise without abstraction. Minor deduction for “shape that has not yet formed,” which flirts with thesis-speak yet is saved by the crystallizing final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aldric’s pewter-and-phosphor sensorium; diction (“gorget,” “vambrace,” “silver filament”) remains armor-and-alchemy specific. Rhythmic control peaks as armor drops—single-sentence staccato then lyrical expansion—without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: armor stripping does quadruple duty—ritual step, psychological exposure, causal trigger, symbolic payoff. Mixed-metaphor risk (“draft through cracked glass”) is justified by the greenhouse’s literal breath. One template cadence run (“Then the…Then the…”) is purposeful mimicry of ritual action, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Knight-as-puppet transcends trope by reversing agency: he learns choreography was copied from his forgotten order, so the puppet master is absent and the knight rewrites his own strings. Alchemical orchard plus star-alphabet folds genre war trauma into lyric cosmology without novelty for its own sake. Risk-taking (no dialogue, no human antagonist) heightens resonance and pays off.</comment>
