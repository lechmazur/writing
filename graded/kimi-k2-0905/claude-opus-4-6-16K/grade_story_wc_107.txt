<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—her need to narrate order while surrounded by collapse, her simultaneous surrender to and resistance of thaw—are dramatized in concrete beats (self-narration vs. re-wiring sensors). Her interiority is glass-specific, never generic, and the final choice to “begin again” is earned by the causal chain of bookmark touches, dripping ice, and restored panel light. Embodied cost is legible in the cracked bookmark spine pressed like a “splint against a broken bone,” anchoring her decision. No safety-hedging: she stays alone in a failing vault, refusing exit or false hope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ice keeps dripping, but Maren re-prices her frozen grief into a mandate to shape “molten unknown.” Causal linkage holds throughout—each sensor she re-lights is a because/therefore response to thaw—and the final image of her beginning again is visible cost under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean by line 4 (who/where/when). Persistent constraint: the bookmark’s cracked spine literalizes irreversible damage that will shape every future choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dripping ice threads, flickering overhead panel, and leather bookmark function as micro-setting that constrain choices: she can’t leave the console until she maps the thaw. Bookmark reappears at closure, pressed like a splint, recharging earlier glass/light motifs. Sensory hierarchy is glassblower-biased: she notices refraction, filament curves, annealer memories. No static catalogue; each detail is filtered through her professional eye and either enables wiring choices or mirrors internal melt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she stay present to irreversible thaw without retreating into frozen grief—tightens once: narrating shifts from ironic shield to prayerful stance. Escalation is accumulative: each new drip and revived sensor adds density until the bookmark snap crystallizes cost. Agency is continuous (every toggle is her refusal to flee). No coincidence; pressure is environmental and internal, forcing stance crystallization. Price visible: she forfeits the safety of perpetual winter inside herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from glass metaphors melted into climate grief: shaping molten unknown becomes the moral equal of shaping seed-vault data. No overt thesis; the final line “She begins” is an image, not a moral. Subtext in gesture—pressing cracked leather like a splint—carries the weight of inherited fragility. Ambiguity lingers: thaw could still destroy everything, but inquiry itself is reframed as craft. Resonance arises from particulars (bookmark, drip, panel flicker) rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is glassblower: light bends, filaments spin, scents rise “like a dispatch from civilization.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for memory, staccato “She drinks. She begins.” for decisive beats. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression taught early (“She narrates”) and paid off in final quiet line. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Internal texture coherent under stress: metaphors stay optical/thermal, never stray into generic therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths breathe with sensor toggles and memory expansions. No loops or scaffold; every clause adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors are glass-specific and consistent (light, melt, filament) without overcrowding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves as image. Minor over-modification in “molten orange worlds” but does not touch closure. Pronoun and tense clean; no synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-science seed vault meets artisanal glassblowing grief, rendered through self-narration mechanic not seen in prior fiction. Thawing heart as literal permafrost and kiln metaphor transforms familiar eco-anxiety into intimate craft ethics. Risk of solitary POV in abandoned room is embraced, not hedged; narration-as-prayer justifies the device. Specificity of bookmark spine, drip cadence, and annealer memory makes premise irreplaceable. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
