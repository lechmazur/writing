<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s tinker-identity is vivid—her damp soldering iron, pocket of screwdrivers, habit of “opening broken things” all feel lived-in. The interior contradiction between her love of measured plans and the need to “befriend uncertainty” is dramatized in the moment she pockets the compass rose, not merely labeled. Closure cost is legible: she accepts an open-ended guardianship that will upend her solitary life. Only the letter beat feels slightly tidy, keeping her from a 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: three clocks → coordinates → greenhouse → cipher key → new responsibility. Each step tightens options; the compass rose is not a MacGuffin but a live constraint on future action. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—she “began” without a plan, soldering iron in hand, foreclosing the safety of anonymity. One micro-drag: the 200-year letter lands as pure exposition; still, the lens stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone cavern, perpetual mist, thermal leaf-cyclone—selective sensory triad anchors every move. The greenhouse’s slow vortex is not backdrop; it forces Maren to push through physical resistance, mirroring her cognitive shift. Compass rose and waterfall both return in the final image, re-weighted as tools of navigation and time. Meets 9-band gate: environment constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect refugee safe-harbors—emerges late but immediately narrows future options. Pressure tightens when she realizes the cipher still works; inaction now equals complicity. No antagonist needed; the ethical cost is the tightening agent. Escalation is single-cycle yet sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “repair as resistance” emerges through clocks, compass, and Maren’s willingness to improvise. Subtext in the admiral’s letter—self-immolation to protect the persecuted—reverberates without sermon. Final image of her starting to work “one gear at a time” offers a charged, non-literal answer: restoration of hidden histories, not just mechanisms. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—soldering iron “difficult to light,” leaves “papery edges catch…like whispered warnings.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, shortens during discovery, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction stays within her mechanical lexicon. One clause drifts slightly academic—“conceptual or social cost”—but it sits outside her direct thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “water-stained map,” “oilcloth that crumbled,” “thermal draft…spiraled” all do double duty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“swallowed every silence”—never crowding the mechanical clarity Maren values. Final line breathes, giving cadence release without momentum loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing underground waterfall tinkerer with naval-cipher scavenger hunt feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The compass rose reappears as both historical relic and living key, transforming familiar salvage-trope into archival activism. Risky choice to hinge climax on a centuries-old letter pays off because the emotional transfer—from admiral’s arson to Maren’s open-ended repair—lands through concrete objects, not exposition. Specificity of damp soldering iron beside bronze artifact secures freshness.</comment>
