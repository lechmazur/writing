<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory drives—profit vs. conscience—stay active in-scene: she fingers the whale while picturing Petra dispossessed. Body cues (cool tile, second heartbeat at ribs) externalize guilt without lapsing into label-speak. The micro-choice to pocket the whale and seek Petra first crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses the path of continued silence; cost is visible and scaled to length. Interiority remains concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrases; only the “architecture of guilt” line flirts with abstraction, keeping this just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: Dusek commission → Petra displaced → Maren’s silence → whale discovery → decision to confess. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within 120 words via terrace, dusk, cloth bundle. Closure is a Decisive Change: Maren chooses restitution over erasure, cost felt in the whale pressing like a second heartbeat. Persistent constraint—her complicity—shapes every tactical tilt; lens stays Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace tiles, salt-bleached driftwood, and the brass watch hand are selectively detailed and concretely handled; the whale carving literally constrains the final choice by fitting into the coat pocket. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Maren’s professional eye: archival paper, daguerreotype, inventory recall. Weather and light evolve from bruise-colored dusk to darkness, tracking her decision window. Micro-setting (pocket against ribs) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will continue to hide—tightens when the whale artifact offers a reversible path; cost is the irreversible shame of confession. One meaningful turn: discovery of the watch-hand whale forecloses continued silence and forces restitution. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the plot. Pressure scales credibly under 800-word ceiling, though a second beat of external interference would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: false genealogies vs. undeniable artifact; “letting the record stand, ugly and complete” is the emergent moral calculus. Subtext lives in gesture—pocketing the whale, feeling it beat—rather than thesis. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: the brass hand points toward a time that must be acknowledged. No tidy equivalence; Maren remains morally stained even as she chooses truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-close limited stays locked to Maren; perceptual signature filters everything through genealogist’s diction—“scattered alphabet,” “wax seals,” “archival paper.” Rhythm tightens under pressure: short sentences at whale discovery, longer reflective cadences on terrace. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts smoothly to body level (“pressed against her ribs”). Free indirect slips are clean; filter verbs serve voice (“she recognized the style”). Read-aloud ear shows deliberate variation without algorithmic patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “salt-bleached and cracked” paints wood and moral state simultaneously. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are clean. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “guilt became architecture” is the single abstraction, earned by context. Brass watch hand as metaphor for inevitable reckoning is precise, not strained. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: black-market genealogist who forges lineages confronts the palpable remnant of the real past. Driftwood alphabet and whale-bone clock fuse natural found object with archival crime. Conceptual risk—quiet ending without courtroom fireworks—pays off by reweighting meaning rather than plot twist. Specificity of Rohn estate inventory and journeyman horologist 1887 keeps world particular; premise could not swap names without collapse.</comment>
