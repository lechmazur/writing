<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tal’s “quietly determined” trait is shown through deliberate micro-choices—descending the mine, naming the huge awakening, hammering each bolt—so motive stays legible. Interiority is sparse but character-particular (“shaping metal the way rain shapes stone”). No real contradiction or visible flaw is tested, so the arc is flat, yet the requested endurance/renunciation is earned: he keeps the forge lit instead of chasing grandeur. Enough for mid-high band, but not the full combustion needed for 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: desire bolts → offer trade → request awakening → descend → hammer. Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: “quiet defiance rang on” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (planet and smith revived, labor continues). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only nit: the awakening itself is lightly off-stage summarized (“copper veins flickered”), blunting full cost visibility, but the ending image pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating granite arches, root-draped trees, and the forge-mouth at a played-out mine create an immediate, tactile world. Details filter through Tal’s salvager-eye—iron filings, copper dust—so every sense note does double duty. The arches reappear in the final line, recharged as witnesses to “quiet defiance,” satisfying the 9+ gate. One stray: “valley floors to impossible cliffs” is stock phrasing, but它不损害整体清晰度或结局。</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Primary stake—can Tal secure ore to stay open?—is signaled early and tightened when he risks the entire mine’s resurrection. The magician’s silk keeps tension physical: will it flare ash and break the deal? One meaningful escalation—awakening granted—pays off in forty bolts. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: perpetual labor now required to feed a living mine. Slight reserve: no tangible drawback shown beyond “more rubble waiting,” keeping it just sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet persistence emerges through image (rain-shaping stone, heartbeat hammer) rather than statement. Final image reweights “rubble” from waste to source, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No motif checklist: arches and forge exist first as geography/tools, gain resonance only at close. Ambiguity remains—planet revived, but at what future strain?—inviting reflection beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Tal’s perceptual filter: “meek in voice, deliberate in strike.” Sentence rhythm mirrors blacksmith patience—long calm phrases, sudden metallic verbs. No head-hop; magician’s interior accessed only via silk color, a clean external cue. One hiccup: “the way rain shapes stone” and “slumbering god” edge toward literary template, but the bulk of diction is fresh, controlled, and audible under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double work: “He descended into them deliberately, lantern in hand, because the rubble down there still held fragments worth salvaging” glides from action to motive to world lore. Metaphors are few, precise, and paid off (rain→stone; heartbeat→hammer). No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. A single mixed moment—“sky burned azure from horizon to arch to horizon”—repeats noun, but clarity survives and closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Forging labor as planetary CPR feels novel; orchards hanging off hovering stone ribs provide fresh visuals without stealing focus. Bartered “awakening” could have been generic magic-commerce, but here it targets sub-economic tailings, syncing theme and world. Risk taken: Cosmic-scale resurrection compressed into 750 quiet words—yet causality holds, so boldness lifts rather than obscures. Derivative-premise guardrail waived.</comment>
