<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. the need to weigh guilt—drives every move; the deleted-recording reveal forces a credible, embodied collapse. Micro-choice of turning the valve back lands as earned renunciation with visible cost (she “walked back…lighter by exactly that much”). Flaw: “religiously skeptical” repeats instead of deepening, and Dad’s fate is expositional, keeping her just shy of 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: hum lures → valve turns → recording detonates → silence → second turn → closure. Orientation tidy within 120 words; stakes tighten exactly once when her own words play back, foreclosing denial. Cost is legible in final weight image. Slight over-reliance on flashback capsule keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tunnel’s damp breath, contracting beads, and speaker wired behind brass valve compress setting into a micro-crucible that literally houses her confession. Every sensory pick is filtered through urban-explorer bias; no tourist catalog. Valve wheel reappears at closure, re-weighted from occult object to off-switch for guilt machinery—meets 9+ gate of object charging final image. One cliché (“mill had been dead for forty years”) prevents 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measure the “weight of a swallowed truth”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened exactly once when the recording forces acknowledgment, narrowing her options to stay or leave in silence. Agency is clean: turning valve back = renunciation with on-page cost. Could use one earlier tangible loss (time, gear, physical risk) to punch 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Architecture-of-guilt theme emerges through concrete objects (valve, beads, speaker) rather than assertion; final image reweights “ghost shift” from supernatural to psychological haunting without moralizing. Echo of her deleted words implies reader knowledge gap resolved at cost—tight dramatic irony. Avoids tidy absolution; resonance lingers in stone’s “indifferent solidity.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s skeptical, engineer-eye perception; diction (“tensile strength of rusted bolts”) is character-specific. Rhythm accelerates into staccato observations under shock, then exhales with longer cadence as she sits. No head-hop; psychic distance controlled. One register lift (“architecture of guilt made audible”) edges toward writerly but is earned by closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language sparse, precise: “tunnel exhaled its damp breath” primes guilt-as-atmosphere without purple. High information density—each line advances character, object, or mood. Minor filter verb (“she felt the vibration”) is purposeful tactile cue. Clean mechanics; closure line lands with cadence punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Forgotten tunnel as externalized guilt-storage feels fresh; psych-oncology via industrial archaeology avoids standard haunt tropes. Talk-radio triangulation method supplies specificity unlikely to be duplicated. Risk is moderate—concept could tilt gimmicky—but grounded in tactile detail and credible explorer subculture. Not transformative enough for 8.8+ but memorably angled.</comment>
