<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—performing equanimity while mining others’ pain—are dramatized in the dome’s hush; the micro-choice to hand the stage over is earned by Petra’s accusation and his own half-lit recognition of complicity. The cost is visible: he must surrender control and face terror. Interiority stays concrete via ink-stained hands and the tactile story stick. Petra’s single line of pressure suffices to tilt the relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Petra’s accusation → Marcus’s reversal → on-page offer to cede the stage, with felt cost (“That terrifies you”). Closure is a Decisive Change that forecloses his solo-performer identity. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (dome crack, concrete floor). No lens ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cracked dome’s starlight blade and creosote air are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain Marcus’s epiphany; the campfire stick functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when he sets it down. Spatial choreography is clean: sitting under crack → standing → service door → van. Sensory hierarchy favors visual and tactile cues aligned with calligrapher perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical right to tell others’ stories—is signaled early and tightens when Petra’s accusation collapses Marcus’s rationalizations. One meaningful reversal: from performer to facilitator, with on-page cost (terror). Agency is his offer to hand over the stage; coincidence absent. Pressure escalates under causal lens because the argument directly narrows his options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—exploitation vs. stewardship of stories—emerges through puppet shows, the Navajo veteran’s gift, and Marcus’s half-lit epiphany rather than statement. Final image of the cracked dome “still listening” reweights prior material with conceptual cost: he must now listen instead of speak. No moralizing line; ambiguity remains (he may fail). Subtext in Petra’s “Good” carries approval of his fear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s urbane perceptual signature—calligraphic precision, ink stains, Copperplate certainty. Syntax modulates from languid reflection to short, breath-held admissions under pressure. No head-hopping; Petra’s voice is external and distinct in its brevity. Free indirect style cleanly handles “half-lit thing, a candle seen through fog.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “starlight that fell across the concrete floor” does image + atmosphere + stakes in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies from long cadenced sentences to clipped dialogue. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“collapse,” “foreclose”) propel momentum. Final line lands with imagistic punch without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher-turned-puppeteer forced to reverse the gaze inside a dead radar dome—specific, non-obvious, and inevitable given the stick and dome imagery. Navajo veteran’s gift avoids appropriation by remaining one man’s授权, not universal talisman. Risk in quiet epilogue pays off: terror acknowledged, outcome suspended. No trope recycling without transformation.</comment>
