<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied deafness and year-long numbness are rendered through tactile micro-choices—hand on limestone, palms on bench—so the four-second “filament of hush” re-opening her chest feels earned. The final silent weep is credible renunciation: she leaves the cave still deaf, now sustainably porous to feeling. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the arc is interior and singular. Sufficient interior cost for 600-word scope, but secondary pressures (Aldo, students) are off-page, capping relationship crucible points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the cracked numbness is legible by the final oak-touch, cost paid in eleven months of muteness and the broken needle that remains broken. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reversed record layers density until the mirrored hush reweights the stake. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 120 words via limestone mouth and October wind. No causal discontinuity; the phonograph’s backward mechanics are set up early and paid off in the cave’s acoustic inversion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Limestone cavern as acoustic kiln constrains the climax: the walls fold reversed sound into stillness that Elara’s wrists must read. Seasonal shift from October to November is traced through cooling rock and falling leaves she can’t hear, charging the final oak-touch. Portable phonograph and snapped needle serve as micro-setting objects that alter tactics. Economy-driven detail—no door, only “mouth”—grounds spatial choreography without tour-guide excess.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each reversed record; the filament of hush is the only vector that can pierce it. One meaningful deepening: the fourth-second sensation repeats at full intensity only after seven records, foreclosing the option of permanent anesthesia. Cost is felt on-page via silent weeping and the cracked seam she must now “find again.” No external antagonist required; pressure is situational and accumulative.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: sensory lack as wintering survival, thawed by inverse sound that cancels itself into palpable silence. The mirrored hush motif reweights from cryptic vibration to emotional re-ignition without exposition. Final oak-touch reseasons the opening “rustle of turning” into lived acceptance—no moral stated. Complexity preserved: numbness was protective, not villainous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tactile perceptual signature—cool rock, damp wall, crank torque—without auditory references Elara cannot access. Rhythmic control heightens: long sensuous sentences for descent, clipped clauses at needle drop. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Experimental reversal syntax (“memory of its own departure”) is taught early and paid off. Voice distinctiveness approaches the 9-band line but stops just shy of idiosyncratic diction that would risk mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—sound as kiln-shaping heat, sap-withdrawal as winter survival. High information density: “filament of hush” condenses physics and emotion into one phrase. Opening and closing lines book-end with seasonal cadence, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing deaf musical pedagogy with reversed shellac acoustics yields a non-obvious portal into grief recovery; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—Aldo’s mallets “like sleeping birds,” limestone “mouth” swallowing wind—anchors freshness. Risk in lyric stillness pays off without gimmickry. Could nudge higher with one more external obstacle, but within word limit the concept is fully owned.</comment>
