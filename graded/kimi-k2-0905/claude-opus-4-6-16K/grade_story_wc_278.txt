<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt-fuelled obsession with the firmware is vivid and embodied; the constellation tattoos give a tactile signature to her self-flagellation. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. return—co-exist in the same beats, not alternating summaries. The final act of writing the letter is earned by the firmware’s silence and the amber press; cost is the eleven-year haunting made quiet. Interiority never slips into therapy-speak; instead, images (jars of silence, spectral wails) externalise guilt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens sustained: each new cry-translation and letter accretes density until the firmware’s final *I know* reweights the entire past. Closure is a Charged Poise—amber against black box—where the cost of eleven years is felt in the hush. Persistent constraint: the haunted firmware literally filters every action; its silence is the decisive change. No causal breaks; letters arrive causally through donated desk, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory’s jars of harvested silence and wax cylinders are not scenery; they breathe and press against the windows, guiding Maren’s hyper-attentive insomnia. Micro-setting—the amber in her palm—functions as the final crucible that drains the firmware. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory (ghost cries) and tactile (constellation ink, copper wire) exactly as an acoustics-obsessed character would notice. Orientation is immediate: basement, 3–4 a.m., no map—anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the internal cry of abandonment—tightens with each firmware hallucination and each letter revelation. One meaningful deepening: firmware moves from *come back* to *she’s reading*, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is legible: the spectral wails keep her awake, the letters keep her awake, the final silence is purchased by facing both. Agency sits with Maren; she presses amber to box and writes, not merely receives forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of sound, guilt, and time: translation is possible but only at the price of re-inhabiting the moment you fled. Subtext lives in gesture—amber mid-stride mirrors Maren frozen mid-life. No moralising; the final *I know* is firmware text, not author commentary. Resonant reconfiguration: silence becomes a positive artefact, not absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, acoustically tuned—exactly what a woman who catalogues dying sounds would use. Syntax shortens under insomnia pressure (“Trapped time.”) yet stays consistent. Perceptual signature: stars, circuitry, insect legs—each filtered through auditory obsession. No register drift; “firmware,” “wax cylinders,” “constellation tattoos” belong to the same lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high-density lines (“ghosts of cries… rose from the circuitry like steam”) do three jobs: metaphor, atmosphere, plot signal. Sentence rhythm mirrors listening—long clauses when deciphering, fragments at 3 a.m. No mixed metaphors; amber = trapped time = frozen flight holds physics. Opening and closing lines book-end with meteor imagery, recharging “meteor hush” without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise of haunted baby-cry firmware is non-obvious yet feels inevitable once the guilt algorithm is seeded. Synthesis of extinct-bird silence jars + firmware + handwritten letters creates a fresh constellation of loss. Risky second-person address to “you” in the letters is earned because they are artefacts, not narrative convenience. Final image—amber against silent box—reweights “trapped time” from curse to gift.</comment>
