<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Maren’s quietly-enthusiast interiority is anchored in concrete, POV-filtered detail (“private thrill…language she was beginning to learn”) and her micro-choice to stand, gather coins, accept further duty shows a credible endurance with felt cost. The contradictory pull between fatalism and agency is dramatised, not labelled. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; no competence inflation or diagnostic jargon. Motivation stays consistent and scales to the final image.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis under the Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren’s decision to keep casting despite acceleration of un-occurrence crystallises her poise with visible cost (“She would tell the crew…Even if the coins fell the same way twice”). Cause-and-effect are compressed but legible—static intervals shrinking → coins land → corridor & oxygen loss already un-happened. Orientation within 120 words: who (Maren), where (amber deck), when (post-contraction “night”). No lens ambiguity or orientation penalty.</comment>

<comment>The amber deck, pooled light, and impossible coins create a tactile micro-setting that directly constrains Maren’s method; coin electromagnetic signatures literally form her crude instrument. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—visual/auditory bursts, felt weight of coins. Spatial choreography is clean: coins spread, spun, rolled, gathered. No exposition dump; world-rules (“light had nowhere left to go”) emerge through action. Setting charges closure image (“amber light pooled around her feet”) re-weighting earlier detail.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—continue interpreting static to preserve crew options—signalled early. Escalation is the shrinking burst interval that forces Maren’s recognition of already-unhappened losses; tightening is meaningful because the observatory’s coherence is the only resource. Agency resides in her choice to keep casting despite knowledge that endpoint is fixed; cost is the emotional load of impossible authority. No coincidence resolves; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens. Sufficient for 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the necessity of choice inside absolute fatalism; subtext carried by image (impossible coins, backward static) rather than thesis. Final line’s repetition (“Especially then”) reweights earlier material without moralising. Ambiguity is productive; reader left to feel whether alignment with purpose is courage or denial. No thematic echo sentence; no platitudes. Resonance arises from specific particulars of random-as-governance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature: “symphony played in reverse,” “electromagnetic signature,” rhythmic preference for clausal compression mirroring compressed cosmos. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Diction (“crude instrument,” “un-occurred”) remains within her plausible lexicon of technician-interpreter. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors internally consistent (light pooled, stochastic governance). Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences shorten under rising static frequency, matching tension.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty—worldbuild, characterise, advance (“Coins from civilisations…metals that had since unbonded”). No synonym loops; “coins” reused deliberately to accrue resonance. Figurative language sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffolding; each paragraph removes knowledge or charge if cut. Grammar clean; opening and final lines frame voice and re-charge motif. Occasional elevated cadence is POV-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-heat-death setting + stochastic governance via impossible coins + backward prophecy as working plot device. Premise commits fully; no late rule patch. Specificity of coin interference patterns and “wavelength align” language makes concept irreplaceable. Cultural risk—abstract cosmology—paid off through embodied affect and micro-choice. Not an echo of familiar scene; transformation test passed. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure clarity.</comment>
