<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s survivor guilt and distrust are vividly embodied; her micro-choice to place the bolt is the hinge. Interiority fuses past trauma with present wonder without therapy-speak. Final laugh crystallizes earned shift from victim to agent. Only slight cap: bolt decision could show sharper cost or risk on her body/stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: crystalline structure forms, reweighting “pressure” from weapon to tool. Causal chain holds: bolt placement focuses light → boundary stabilizes; text messages seed causality. Cost is conceptual but legible—she forecloses old victim stance. Orientation clean by 120 words; lens (Causal) steady.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Subterranean farm, breathing fungi, and impossible light are rendered through Mara’s distrustful gaze; every sensory pick is filtered. Bolt-as-micro-setting constrains final act and recharges containment motif. Spatial choreography stays crisp in single figure/field. One minor slip: “cavern walls” late add could use earlier anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she turn crushing pressure into creation?—tightens once when she chooses to focus light instead of flee. Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates (texts). Felt cost is conceptual (trust reopened) rather than visceral, capping high-band entry. Sufficient for 800-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moral: transformation is self-directed, not sold. Diamond image flips from MLM lie to crystallized coherence—elegant repricing. Subtext in bolt and light avoids statement. Final laugh offers charged poise; complexity retained. No thesis line mars closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mara’s synesthetic perception; rhythm flexes with wonder vs. dread. Lexicon stays within her educated survivor range. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction vivid yet controlled (“shadowseam light”). One filter lapse: “she understood” could compress to immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses—sentence lengths vary, fungi glow without purple overload. Mixed metaphors kept minimal; “cathedral” and “lens” coexist via taught pattern. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated noun (“wavelengths that shouldn’t exist”) justified by POV awe. Clean copy, strong momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Quantum-farm concept feels fresh yet grounded; survivor-of-scam angle reframes familiar “pressure makes diamonds” trope. Bolt repurposing and concept-to-matter leakage avoid gimmickry through sensory follow-through. Risky color palette paid off. Slight proximity to Vandermeer vibe, but voice remains distinct.</comment>
