<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirenne’s interior contradiction—hunger to read versus fear of collapsing the library—drives every beat; the mother’s unspoken confession forces a visible renunciation (removing the veil) that costs her prior identity. Micro-choices (timing the cipher, pressing grooves into paper) embody stakes without exposition. The 11-year search is told, not dramatized, keeping her barely short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the second letter is the one she now writes, turning the library’s silence outward with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—watch measures delay → cipher cycles transcribed → mother’s shame revealed → veil removed → letter propagated. The “delay” motif taught in line 1 pays off in the final image; cost is legible in the act of unveiling and the perpetual propagation of exposed secrets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing, mist-filled shelves function as micro-setting: their light and cyclical blankness constrain how long Mirenne can read before the text reverses, directly shaping her transcription tactic. Warm paper scent and amber radiance are filtered through her cautious awe; no extraneous geography. The watch as portable “interval” tool serves as secondary setting-object that meters her attention, charging the final image when she sets it down.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the unspoken—tightens when the cipher’s cycles threaten to erase her mother’s confession; the watch’s ticking literalizes dwindling opportunity. One meaningful deepening: recognizing her mother’s voice escalates internal cost and forces the veil removal, foreclosing anonymity. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each decoded line increases psychic weight rather than external danger, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as inherited shame—emerges through the mother’s unspoken line and Mirenne’s act of externalizing it; no moralizing statement intrudes. The veil shifts from protective object to emblem of maternal fear, reweighted at closure when she discards it. Subtext resides in the watch measuring trust-debt, linking con-artist past to archival present. Final image of words propagating outward offers resonant, non-literal answer to what should be done with swallowed words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is synesthetic—time as breath-like delay, text as luminous ribs. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“mist curled between shelves that rose like luminous ribs”) then compresses during recognition (“she stopped breathing”), mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mirenne’s arcane but plausible lexicon. Compression in “cyclically reversed like breath” is taught by earlier pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “cautious exuberance” packs contradiction in two words; each sentence advances image or stakes. One paraphrase loop—“blank, then not blank, then blank again”—is intentional pattern-teaching, not artifact. Metaphors (library as creature ribs, delay as tide) cohere without contradiction. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; high information ratio sustains lyric momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Library of Unspoken Words literalizes emotional latency through palpable architecture and reversible text, a fresh synthesis of archival fantasy and family elegy. The confidence-man watch repurposed as metronome for silence is a specific, non-obvious inflection. Risky second-person address in the final letter is earned because the propagation mechanic turns every reader into “anyone,” universalizing without abstraction. Conceptual integrity never retreats; the premise’s implications (perpetual outbound letters) are followed to their limit.</comment>
