<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—foolish façade vs. lethal recorder—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation (document, don’t warn) is earned and paid for by her mother’s erasure. Embodied emotion is vivid in the needle’s pressure on silk, but the text occasionally abstracts to “she heard everything,” blunting peak embodiment. Competence is high, yet genuine struggle is implied rather than dramatized on this beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stitched galaxy becomes an indelible record no fire can erase, reweighting silence itself as weapon. Causal chain is tight—listening → charting → synchronizing → preserving—each step foreclosing warning in favor of witness. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without wobble. Cost is legible in the final image of dancing but undying flame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dome’s acoustic channeling is not backdrop but tool: sound architecture funnels conspiracy to Maren’s needle, directly enabling the plot. The eternal candle’s micro-setting—amber light on silver thread—constrains stitch color and cipher legibility, charging the final glow that signals coup countdown. Autumn wind through the slit physically threatens the flame, tightening the last beat. Every environmental detail is filtered through Maren’s professional attention to texture and silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve truth beneath coup—tightens once: from listening to irrevocable documentation. The candle-pulse signal is the visible price; it exposes Maren to anyone watching the dome, narrowing her future options. No reversal, but the deepening shift from passive hearing to active preservation satisfies Accumulative escalation. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence: “she heard everything” now means she can never un-hear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: history belongs to those deemed negligible. Subtext lives in the diplomats’ sneer “decorative nonsense” versus the reader’s sight of treason mapped in silk. The mother’s erasure reweights the final stitch into an act of posthumous solidarity. No moralizing—just the cold reconfiguration of who gets to remember.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter: acoustic shadows, thread tension, candle jitter. Syntax lengthens and contracts with stitch rhythm; diction is precise—“oxidized to that particular shade of blue”—without purple drift. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through textured interiority and sensorial selection. The final image of wind-entered flame is a perfect perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “whispers…arrived perfectly preserved” advances both acoustics and plot. Metaphors are spare, never stacked; mixed-vehicle risk is avoided. One paraphrase loop—“she heard what lived between those echoes” / “she heard everything”—is minor enough to keep clarity intact. Opening and closing lines bookend with acoustic imagery, creating propulsive symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Female knowledge-work disguised as craft is not new, but the acoustic observatory that weaponizes echoed silence feels singular. The embroidery-cipher literalizes “textile as text” without meta-wink, and the mother-ghost avoids sentimental redemption. Risk is taken by refusing a confrontation beat; the story stakes everything on the final reweighting of silence. Transformation is complete: remove any detail (candle, dome, stitch) and the whole collapses.</comment>
