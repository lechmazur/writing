<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. bereaved mother—lives in her mud-caked boots and the prism pressed to her sternum; the micro-choice to hand the prism to the narrator instead of explaining again crystallizes her motive. The narrator’s own shift from detached observer to unwilling vessel of Lily’s grief is embodied in the tear he wipes away with the lie “cold air,” a cost that sticks. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; emotion is felt in chest-crack and frost, not labels. The only bar to 9-band is that the narrator’s final epiphany is mostly reported, not dramatized in a further choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frost returns to “meaningless beauty” while the narrator writes “inconclusive,” a lie that reweights every prior beat with unbearable cost. Causal linkage holds—the prism → frost → grief transfer occurs because Sera’s decade of trial has engineered this moment, and the narrator’s body is the price. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is fixed within 120 words; the mist and arbor are immediate. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of sensory pattern (frost spirals, grief geometries) tightens once and holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, Volvo windshield, and glass prism function as micro-setting that literally constrains choice: only this lattice of crystals and ice allows the resonance experiment to occur. Mist is not mood-fog but a physical medium that swallows light and sound, making the shifted hush possible. Spatial choreography is flawless—prism placed, frost races, narrator steps back—every beat grounded in tactile geometry. The 9-band gate is satisfied: the tool (prism) and environment (frost on glass) jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be literally extracted and shown?—tightens once when the frost reorganizes into Lily’s spiral; the narrator’s body becomes the live test site. Escalation is textural: density of sensory pattern (grief geometry) accumulates until the narrator’s chest cracks open; the cost is felt, not declared. No reversals are needed; the single deepening is sufficient for 800 words. Cost is visible on-page: “I wiped my eyes and told her it was the cold air,” a forfeiture of scientific detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the world is soaked with stranger-sorrow, and “truthful lies” are the only mercy we can offer. The final image—frost returning to randomness—reprises the opening motif of mist-as-grief but reweights it: beauty is not empty; we are merely deaf. Subtext operates in silence: Sera never asks for belief, only witness, and that request is wordless. No moral is pronounced; the cost is the lie the narrator will live inside forever.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a perceptual signature—scientific detachment warped by latent longing: “I told myself it was thermodynamics.” Syntax tightens under pressure—single-clause sentences appear at the exact moment the chest cracks. Register stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon; no academic drift. Dialogue is minimal but clean: Sera’s clipped invitation “Come see the car” carries more subtext than exposition could supply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Metaphors are internally coherent—mist “like grief clings to old houses” and frost “like a child’s drawing of the sun”—and never mixed. High information density: “canvas jacket and mud-caked boots” conveys Sera’s entire ethos in five words. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hush it describes; no drumbeat cadence. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion-as-crystallography, grief as literal lattice in ice, is not a trope catalogue but a new angle earned by concrete apparatus (prism, frost, Volvo). Risky choice to hinge the climax on a windshield frost pattern pays off because the physics is staged, not asserted. Specificity anchors universality—Lily’s “small rainbows” could only belong to this child. The transformation test passes: swap prism for any generic talisman and the entire causal chain collapses.</comment>
