<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet-registrar persona is sharply etched through tactile ledger beats and her “studied signatures for tremors of truth.” Interior contradiction—belief in institutional myth vs. hunger to witness—acts in-scene when she lifts the lens and sees “every crack… rendered honest,” earning her final registry act. Jonah’s thinner/older exterior change is noted, but his silence-era motive is confessed in a single expository slab; we don’t feel the calcified suspicion in his body under live pressure. The micro-choice to open the ledger and sign carries visible institutional risk, fulfilling cost; relationship crucible pressure is lighter because Jonah’s stakes are told more than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: doodles → door invitation → forecourt meeting → lens evidence → registry entry, each beat a because/therefore step that narrows Maren’s options. Closure lands as Decisive Change—she inscribes the testimony under seal—cost printed on the page (“she signed her name beneath his testimony and closed the ledger”). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 66 via crystal forecourt after rain; no penalty. Single shard default respected; one micro-turn suffices for 700-word scope. Expository lump for Jonah’s past is the lone pacing drag but does not rupture causality at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s second protagonist: wet quartz stones hum pitch that cues Maren’s attention and later answers Jonah’s confession, literally resonating with honesty. Every spatial beat is lived-in—ledger pressed to chest, lens held to light, colonnade cracks magnified—so environment steers choice. Rain-pooled engravings mirror sky, fusing external state to internal stakes without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the lens) ultimately constrains the final gesture: only its clear core lets Maren verify truth and act, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—institutional truth vs. complicity—surfaces in paragraph 3 and tightens when the lens offers proof that could end her career. One meaningful escalation: Maren pivots from suspicion to witness, foreclosing silence; price is professional safety, legible on-page via signed seal. No reversal for Jonah, but his vulnerability in handing over the lens intensifies her risk. Pressure stays causal and coherent under the inferred Causal lens; coincidence merely arranges the meeting, not the resolution.</comment>

<comment>Theme of “recorded honesty as liberation” emerges through recurring registry acts and crystal acoustics, never sermonized. Subtext lives in doodle-icons that shift from opaque to operative once Maren chooses to believe. Final image—ledger shut, night deepened, crystals whispering—offers Charged Poise that reweights prior silence without moralizing. Complexity retained: institution may still crush them; truth offers no guarantee, only clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Maren’s perceptual bias—she notices signatures, stone harmonics, archival hierarchies. Syntax flexes with pressure: long lyrical cadences in opening calm, crisp parataxis during lens exchange (“She picked up the lens… held it to the light”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through indirection and symbolic object exchange. Free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“She had believed it because everyone believed it”), giving intimate interiority without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “water pooled in the shallow engravings… mirrors of the darkening sky” layers sensory and metaphoric work in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or choice. Figurative control maintains physical logic—wet crystal hums like “struck glass,” an audible simile that pays off narratively. One mixed metaphor risk—“silence had calcified into suspicion”—but calcification imagery is kept consistent through Jonah’s “thinner, older” physique, barely avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Concept of doodle-driven whistle-blowing feels fresh, combining archival noir with acoustic fantasy minimalism. Institutional frame (rare in flash) and micro-object lens-as-proof avoid generic tropes. Transformation test passes: swap locale or doodles and the emotional circuitry breaks. Risk in lyric resonance is purposeful and paid off; no derivative premise penalty applied. Could edge higher with sharper individuation of Jonah’s voice.</comment>
