<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—flying by water, tasting accelerated growth, tears falling upward—yet her want (“find the source of resilience”) stays slightly abstract; the final realization lands as thematic statement rather than lived cost, keeping her arc a hair short of true Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: the broken arrow’s unhealed fracture becomes the engine of fertility, reweighting Maren’s grief into generative frequency. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—water trail, inversion, spiral convergence—culminating in an image whose conceptual cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, sideways orchards, and inverted water columns are rendered with tactile specificity; the hollow gravity sphere and bioluminescent wound-cavity function as micro-setting that literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—reach the Gathering before inversion—tightens when gravity flips early, forcing Maren to ride the reversed water column; the price is bodily disorientation and the knowledge that her own brokenness is the source, not the obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of wound into womb: resilience as the echo of every break, endlessly re-seeding life. The arrow’s unresolved fracture is the perfect non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing while leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains a perceptual signature tuned to flow, density, and hum; diction stays within Maren’s cockpit lexicon, rhythm flexes with aerial pressure, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each flight maneuver braids action, sensation, and world-rule; occasional poetic layering (“tears falling upward”) is earned by taught physics, but two adjacent “water” sentence openings create a minor cadence hiccup short of 9-band purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The gravity-inverting orchard planet, water-navigation, and fertility-from-fracture mechanics synthesize into a fresh speculative ecology; the broken alien arrow as unhealed seed is a risk-taking image that feels inevitable in hindsight, elevating the piece above trope recombination.</comment>
