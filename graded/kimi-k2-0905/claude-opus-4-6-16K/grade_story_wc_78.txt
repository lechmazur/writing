<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is sensorially grounded and stakes-aligned; the mallet-strikes translate belief into embodied choice. Yet her “every obstacle” mantra is voiced twice without fresh contradiction or cost, so the arc flirts with self-help patness rather than flaw-driven tension. Still, the final palm-on-bark beat earns a micro-shift that satisfies earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard surfs the standing wave and locks onto a new current, cost paid in the trembling mallet and humming root-cable. Causal chain (cloud pattern → sonic counter-rhythm → raft survival) is legible and complete. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or luck saves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not picturesque backdrop but tactile instrument: driftwood flex, root-cable tension, and salt-sweet fruit all feed the sonic diagnostics that decide tactics. Blue-hour light and fractal clouds are filtered through Maren’s prophet gaze, never tourist catalog. Environment literally constrains the final strike—fail the resonance, lose the raft—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—raft survival against convergent wave—is signaled early and tightened by the fractal cloud cue. One decisive escalation: the standing wave forces Maren to dub the obstacle with a single high-risk resonance; success reweights trajectory westward. Cost is visible in quivering mallet and lingering root hum. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “obstacle as instrument” emerges through sonic praxis rather than maxim; the final whispered line reweights the premise after the reader has felt the raft bend. Ambiguity lingers: warmer waters may bring unknown reefs, so the victory is provisional. Avoids sermon, earns resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Maren’s perceptual bias—cloud calligraphy, salt-sweet taste, vibration in molars. Syntax lengthens and compresses with sonic discovery; no filter-verb clutter. The lyric register is consistent yet purposeful, rising to the “enormous” unresolving chord without purple spill.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—sensorial data plus diagnostic meaning—so information density stays high. Figurative layer is rich but each metaphor (root-cables as harp strings, clouds as calligraphy) returns to function: they guide the next strike. No loops, no mixed vehicles, no scaffold. A single adverbial flourish (“restless euphony”) is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating salt-orchard tuned like a maritime marimba feels inevitable yet unseen; the sketched-resonance mechanic turns weather-reading into percursive engineering, a fresh synthesis. Risk is high—lyric eco-magic could have slid into whimsy—but grounded causality and tactile cost keep it credible. Transformation passes the “different names, different place” test: remove the sonic diagnostics and the story collapses.</comment>
