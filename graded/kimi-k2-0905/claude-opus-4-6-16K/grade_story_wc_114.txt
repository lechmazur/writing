<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sable’s contradictory impulses—professional self-protection vs. remorse—are dramatized in the smudge gesture and the margin confession; the swallowed truth’s cost is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choice hierarchy (ink petal vs. silence) crystallizes values. Earned Stasis lands because the stone is now carried openly, foreclosing denial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the margin confession reweights prior silence with visible cost (“I said nothing”). Causal lens holds: because she smudges the saxifrage she accepts blur, therefore she writes the truth. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—the logged guilt—shapes future audits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain station constrains choice: isolation amplifies instruments as sole witnesses, the desk surface doubles as confessional, the fever-damp thumb turns paper into mutable evidence. Saxifrage illustration functions as micro-setting that alters tactics—its bleed forces acceptance of imprecision and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—moral accountability—tightens once: smudge act forecloses denial, forcing public confession in margins. Pressure accumulates under causal lens: pressure rise outside parallels internal pressure to speak. Cost is legible on page: permanent ink record of complicity. One meaningful turn sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: blurred saxifrage petal = unquantifiable guilt. Final image reweights premise—truth is weather system, not measurable datum. No moralizing; resonance lives in auroral sorrow and logged confession. Ambiguity survives: forecasters still err, but now carry error openly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains meteorologist’s perceptual signature—barographs, cirrus feathering, dewpoints—without head-hop. Rhythm mirrors pressure change: long sentences in fever calm, shorter fragments during smudge. Free indirect clean: “She had swallowed the warning like a stone.” No register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences do dual work: “The fever broke on the third morning” anchors time and body state. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles consistent (stone, weather). Information density high: ink bleed equals epistemic blur. Final line cadence mirrors mountain persistence, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle: climate scientist as guilt oracle whose error tolerance absorbs moral failure, not just model noise. Smudge as non-verbal confession device transforms botanical art into ethical record. Risk taken with lyric stillness pays off in resonant closure. Could swap names but core synthesis remains distinctive.</comment>
