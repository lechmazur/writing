<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s affliction of noticing is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (keeping the bread, walking the overgrown path) that foreclose the option of forgetting; the final request to garden crystallizes her stance with clear cost. Interiority is specific to her perceptual warp—her throat tightens at Sable’s reverence, she tastes thyme and smoke—never drifting into label-speak. The only drag is that Sable remains more oracle than person, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted; still, Maren alone carries the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sharing of stale bread reconfigures the stakes from solitary witness to collective resistance, cost felt in the quiet vow to “start with the cracks.” Causal linkage holds: because Maren kept the bread and refused the flour, she can now be recruited into guerrilla gardening—each beat follows a tidy because/therefore trail. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty applied. Lens remains causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ruined palace courtyard is rendered through livable detail—ivy swallowing colonnades, moss felting marble—while the mismatched teacups and small fire constrain the intimacy of the pact. Bread as micro-setting is tactile: wrapped in cloth, broken like sacrament, its staleness becomes a spatial barrier the women must negotiate. One minor slip: the “ghost of sweetness” on the wind is a shade generic, but it does not dull the final image. Environment directly shapes the choice to garden here, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the capacity to notice—tightens once: Maren shifts from isolated witness to active gardener, trading safety for exposure. The cost is legible on-page: she accepts the danger of planting “old seeds” in public cracks, foreclosing anonymity. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence required. Secondary stakes (birds gone, bakery erased) deepen but do not complicate, keeping the arc clean at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through bread, tea, and cracked marble—never asserted. The final image reweights the ordinary: stale loaf becomes Eucharist, gardening becomes insurgency. No moralizing line intrudes; meaning resides in the act of eating silence and choosing to plant. Ambiguity lingers—absolution remains tenuous—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual warp: she clocks eleven-minute post-office shifts and catalogs vanished storefronts in a single breath. Syntax mirrors her hyper-attention—“ivy swallowing the colonnades, moss felting the marble”—without drifting into purple. No head-hopping; Sable’s interior is withheld, read only through Maren’s scrutiny. Rhythm accelerates into the final fragment, mirroring the urgency of the seeds passing hands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops, no filter clusters. Metaphors stay coherent (“stone the river couldn’t smooth”) and are sparingly deployed, keeping peak beats clear. One negligible scaffold: “the ghost of sweetness” repeats a wind trope, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “memory-eating flour” conceit freshens the standard dystopian amnesia trope by anchoring it in sourdough chemistry and communion wafers. Guerrilla gardening as resistance weaponizes an eco-hipster cliché into quiet insurgency, made specific through rosemary-encoded paths. The vanished bakery’s last loaf is an irreplaceable MacGuffin—swap it and the sacramental charge collapses. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks obscure stakes.</comment>
