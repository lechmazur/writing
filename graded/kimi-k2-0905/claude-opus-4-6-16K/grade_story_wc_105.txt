<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s synesthetic grief is embodied in salt-stunted apples and gear-laden mud; her interior contradiction—needing to bottle the very rupture she flees—drives every micro-choice. The final resolve to weave burgundy into a warning aid is earned through calibrated, tactile beats, not abstract therapy-speak. Cost is felt in the weeping amid ship ribs and the footprints swallowed behind her. Flaws remain: we never see her falter in real time with a client or witness a tool fail; the occupation stays more poetic label than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Conceptual Repricing: the aurora-lit imprint of Elda’s identical burgundy frequency re-weights Maren’s private pain into a social instrument, the cost legible in her “careful hands” carrying “collected absences” toward a future she must now design for others. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of absent voices/silences thickens until the same hue surfaces, then pivots to future action. No orientation debt; greenhouse/shipwreck geography is anchored within 60 words and returns to charge the final image. Causality intact: every beat adds density or sonic data that tightens the stake in mapping betrayal’s sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse glass leveled with rotting hulls, forge chimney “dark finger,” and aurora’s E-minor chord are selective, POV-filtered details that literally glow across the final image, charging the closure. Micro-setting (recording rig on anvil) enables the decisive capture; salt-apple taste constrains Maren’s perception of perseverance. Spatial choreography clean: she walks orchard paths, sets rig, weeps, exits; wrecks groan in tide without teleport. Meets 9+ gate: environment recurs in final reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map/bottle the sound of trust-breaking—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the same burgundy frequency is discovered beneath greenhouse roots, foreclosing the option to treat the quest as purely private grief. Protagonist agency: Maren calibrates microphones, presses record, decides to build the warning into a hearing aid; each act narrows her path from collector to designer-of-prevention. Cost is visible: she weeps, footprints swallowed, greenhouse sinks another millimeter—loss of the site mirrors loss of innocence. One meaningful deepening suffices for length; escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, and reads cleanly under that lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from refrains of salt, absence, and division: trust as cellular commitment before knowing cost. Subtext in gesture: the unheard Elda voice and unheard aurora chord echo Maren’s muted divorce. Final image of swallowed footprints offers resonant non-literal answer—memory sinks but can be architected into warning. Avoids explicit moral; avoids thematic echo in final paragraph. Slight drift: “sound of trust breaking” is stated early; could have stayed implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV clings tightly to Maren’s synesthetic perception, diction salted with acoustic metaphors (“acoustic shadow of subtraction,” “burgundy that hummed”). Rhythm modulates: long sentences for tide-time, clipped fragments at record-button press. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Distinct perceptual signature—colors heard in chords, orchards tasted in salt—carries into final image. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with tide and aurora curtains; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful: “hulls curving like parentheses” sets orchard as enclosed sentence Earth is writing. One mixed-metaphor risk—“architecture of her grief”—but saved by concrete follow-up (“battered and marvelous”). High information density: each sentence layers grief, site history, and sonic method. No scaffolding; paragraph cuts test clean. Copy-clean except one comma splice after “equipment” that does not cloud causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic grief mapped through negative-space phonography feels fresh; “collecting absences” reverses typical ghost-recording trope. Salt-apple orchard ringed by intentional shipwrecks is specific world-build, not quirky ornament. Conceptual risk—equating cellular division with emotional trust—earned through sustained imagery and final re-pricing. Transformation test passes: swap salt-apples or aurora hue and the emotional math collapses. No derivative premise penalty; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
