<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete (seed-coaxing fingers, notebook with numb digits) and her patience trait is embodied in the kneeling wait and gentle un-knotting; the final stance—carrying the rope “like a scripture”—crystallizes a cost (she alone bears the cold and legacy). No contradictory impulse is staged in real time, so the 9+ gate fails, but the single-POV arc is coherent and sufficiently pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: coiling the encoded rope while snow fills her footprints reweights her mission with undeniable, solitary cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each decoded knot adds density until the final hush crystallizes meaning. Causality remains intact because the earlier knot study directly enables the final transcription and possession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden, snow-blurred dock and fog-muffled harbor filter every beat; the fulgurite’s prismatic flash on rope fibers is a micro-setting choice that literally reveals twist direction and therefore constrains her next delicate move. Weather and wood are not backdrop—they dictate silence, visibility, and the rate at which snow buries footprints, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage dying knowledge—tightens once: the seventh knot cluster yields the lichen-dye code, proving the rope is a living archive and foreclosing the possibility she might walk away empty-handed. Cost is present (frozen knees, solitude, implied lifetime guardianship), but only one meaningful tightening occurs, keeping escalation just shy of the 8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete motif: seeds, knots, and lightning tubes all carry “largest instructions” inside smallest husks; the final image reframes the rope as scripture without moralizing. Subtext in the lullaby half-hitches and the granddaughter’s dismissal of “junk” deepens the quiet argument that women’s knowledge survives only if someone patiently decodes it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinctive—Maren sees embryonic sleep in a pine seed and reads tidal charts in rope twist; rhythm modulates from long, fog-rolling sentences to the clipped “S-twist. The old way.” No head-hopping or register drift; lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off in the hush of the final coil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from oceanic roll to crystalline fragment; figurative language is selective (snow “remembering itself,” rope “intestines of ancient knowledge”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; information density remains high while maintaining read-aloud musicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “secret weavers” embedding arctic medicinal codes in fisherman’s knots is a fresh cultural invention; combining seed biology, textile archives, and lightning glass into one epistemic rescue mission feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final charged poise, exceeding surface novelty with emotional specificity.</comment>
