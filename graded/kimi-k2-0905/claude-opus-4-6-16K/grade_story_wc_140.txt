<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost-woman’s contradiction—yearning to verify her own past while refusing the one act that could restore it—remains interior and observational; we feel it but never see it force a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The notebook entry is the closest she comes to agency, yet it changes no outward risk and is presented as ritual, not turn. Still, her perceptual filter is vivid and consistent, and the final endurance carries a quiet cost that feels earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mosaic of port-yard shards builds a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc whose closure is the Earned Stasis of her remaining erased; the tide-ebb pattern teaches the rhythm early and the final notebook placement crystallizes the before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; geography and chronology stay legible across shards. The only barrier to 9.0 is that the notebook act itself does not tighten external pressure—it merely memorializes an already chosen stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rust-bleeding container cathedral is lived-in, navigated by ankle-deep flood cycles that literally keep workers away and grant her solitude; the lost-manifest container she inhabits is a micro-setting that determines her safety margin. Tide and corrugated corridors constrain every movement she makes. The engineer’s poison-label is handled twice and resurfaces in the final image to re-weight memory’s fragility, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she recover a verifiable self—loses traction because the story eschews escalation for accretion; the pressure is steady-textural rather than narrowing. The only tightening is her choice to write her own fragment, which seals rather than tests her erasure. Cost is conceptual, not felt as lost option, so the beat stays solidly in mid-8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that official erasure grants richer perceptual presence; the refrain of “texture” turns the abstract idea of history into something one can feel with fingertips, culminating in the poison-label’s faded ink. No thesis statements, only image-driven reweighting. The final image of tide carrying secrets seaward offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance consistent; perceptual signature—“grain of a whispered confession,” “voice thinned to wire”—is character-specific and sustained. Sentence rhythm modulates from long tidal sweeps to the clipped final sentence, mirroring her slide into stasis. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction never drifts into editorial gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors are spare and tactile (“metal cathedral,” “fabric she could not verify by touch”). High information density—each sentence layers physical detail with conceptual weight without crowding. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the single-sentence final paragraph, then lands on the resonant beat. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic death-glitch as portal to ghost-life is fresh, but the deeper ingenuity is using overheard dock fragments to build a surrogate self—an ethnography of the living by the erased. Risk-taking in the quiet Accumulative structure pays off: no confrontation, yet the final stillness feels absolute. Specificity of port logistics and tide timing keeps the concept from drifting into allegory.</comment>
