<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet, observant interiority and her slow shift from control to surrender are rendered with consistent, embodied detail—veins of the linden leaf pressed to her wrist, the way moss “stitches decay into structure.” The arc from command to witness is credible and internally coherent, but the absence of any on-page interpersonal pressure keeps the stakes largely intellectual; the cost is conceptually legible yet never jeopardizes a relationship or identity she must defend aloud. A single moment where another voice challenges her would have sharpened the contradiction and lifted this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the garden’s ungoverned thriving crystallizes her renunciation with visible, felt cost—she “let herself be changed by what she could not command.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each storm and volunteer growth layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Transitions are seamless; orientation is anchored within the first 100 words. One causal micro-gap: the insurance payout is named but never complicates later tactics; its absence is felt but does not rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that literally holds the structure together—its “tiny rootlets stitching decay into structure” becomes the story’s governing metaphor and final image. Rain, leaf-veins, and goldfinch droppings are filtered through Maren’s horticultural gaze, each detail doing double duty as observation and self-indictment. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene. Environment constrains choice: the healthier volunteers force her hand, making specificity indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. survival of the nursery—tightens through accumulating natural reversals rather than human opposition. The blight, linden’s health, and returning storms each raise the cost of clinging to command; releasing control becomes the only narrowing option left. Agency is present but contemplative; a sharper external test (e.g., a customer demanding the old perfect stock) would have pushed tension into the 9-band. Still, the pressure pattern is coherent under the Accumulative lens and the price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: governance versus collaboration with life’s uncontrollable intelligence. The shift from “obedience mistaken for thriving” to “witness rather than director” is never sermonized; it is enacted through leaf, moss, and goldfinch droppings. Final image of being “changed by what she could not command” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—she may still fail—but the conceptual cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays snug to Maren’s perceptual signature—phototropic vocabulary, root-as-troops metaphor, chlorophyll redistribution—creating a distinct scientific-lyric texture. Syntax lengthens and relaxes as she loosens control, a subtle cadence shift that mirrors arc. No dialogue appears; absence is justified by her solitude. Free-indirect thought is clean, with filter verbs (“she wondered”) kept minimal and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable: “moss… stitching decay into structure” compresses time and agency into one image. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—no mixed vehicles. One clause (“circuitously sincere”) risks authorial intrusion, but it is early, brief, and soon dramatized through her evasive tours with customers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The nursery-recovery tale is familiar, yet the inversion—health arriving through abandonment, not expertise—feels fresh because the vegetal agents (linden, moss, finch digestion) perform the turning. Specific botanical observations root the metaphor in lived practice rather than self-help shorthand. Risk is taken in the quiet, reflective shape, but coherence under the Accumulative lens validates the choice. Could edge higher with one surprising human complication that tested the same principle.</comment>
