<comment>Maren’s guarded physicality and the embodied wariness ("still moved as though bracing for a blow") are vivid and specific; the contradiction between her fluid dock work and inner armor is kept alive in every beat. The scrimshaw-as-key epiphany is prepared by tactile obsession, but the leap to "unlocks guarded hearts" feels slightly abstract in the moment of swim-or-don’t, so the final cost reads more conceptual than embodied. Callum’s stake in the relationship is sketched mostly through his patience, giving the parting beat less bilateral heat; nevertheless, her renunciation of performance lands as earned. Because interior contradiction drives every micro-choice, characterization stays above the 8-line despite the light trace of Callum’s pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure hits as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s swim detaches her from dock-identity with undeniable opportunity-cost (Callum’s splash provides the witness). Causality is intact—whale-call responds to inner shift signaled by scrimshaw warmth, island surfaces, choice follows. Orientation is clean within 50 words; single shard, one causal tightening, no lens drift. Cost is present but leans conceptual ("done performing") rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on-page, just missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>The sublittoral fringe is rendered through kelp "like funeral bunting" and anemones "clenched," feeding Maren’s funereal vigilance; tide level tracks across beats, guiding when she hears the call. Dock details (rope, winch, crate) root economy without over-cataloguing. The island’s surprise breach is sensed distantly via "water cascading from its flanks," keeping viewpoint honest. Environment does not physically constrain the final swim (no current, fatigue, or obstacle), so it charges mood more than tactic, capping just below 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—"stop pretending"—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the whale-call demands the real self. Mid-scene deepening occurs: scrimshaw shifts from map to key, reweighting knowledge. Escalation is psychological rather than external; options narrow to swim or remain caged. One credible tightening suffices under Accumulative lens, but the price (loss of dock-self) is implied not dramatized, keeping the score sub-8.0.</comment>

<comment>Theme of identity-as-armour emerges through recurring images of cages, tides, and keys; no character moralizes it. Final image of answering the whale reconfigures earlier "fairy-tale" dismissal without verbal statement. Subtext in Callum’s ragged breath supplies tenderness the dialogue never voices. The piece avoids tidy thesis yet lands unmistakable resonance, satisfying the 8.5+ bar.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited hugs Maren’s perceptual filter—"water bypassed her ears and entered through her sternum"—with rhythmic, marine-tinged diction. No head-hopping; Callum’s interior is surfaced only through Maren’s reading of his breath and caution. Syntax flexes from clipped dock cadence to liquid long sentences during the whale-call, mirroring tension release. Voice stays controlled and particular, meriting high-8 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, imagistic, and propulsive; sentences multitask (action + metaphor + interiority) without padding. Only one near-loop detected ("water and stone and bone") which reads purposeful sonics, not scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—tide/armor, key/heart—and climax has no figurative muddle. High density plus clean mechanics warrant 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-violence world where pain persists is fresh angle; disappearing island summoned by whale-bone key flips standard portal trope into psychological reconfiguration. Scrimshaw’s slow reveal from map to heart-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of dock labor and sublittoral ecology keeps premise grounded. Risk resides in the low-page-count fantasy rescue, but earned detail and causality prevent gimmickry, earning mid-8 score.</comment>
