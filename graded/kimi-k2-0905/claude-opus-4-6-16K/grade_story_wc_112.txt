<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-rooted obsession is rendered through concrete micro-choices—wiping lubricant, pulling the manual lever, clutching the tablet—so her interior contradiction (scientist vs. bereaved mother) stays embodied. The final renunciation—publishing proof instead of undoing death—pays the cost promised by the opening, though the station colleagues remain off-stage, so status/relationship pressure is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the waveform laugh re-weights “beside me” and the paper title makes the sideways rule undeniable. Causal chain (twilight alignment → lever → data → publish) is tight; orientation is clear by 80 words; the only minor slack is the single-sentence acknowledgment that could have carried sharper cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transparent floor, vacuum chamber, and spiral staircase are tracked without drift; the velith migration doubles as environmental mirror and temporal compass, directly guiding Maren’s timing. The magnetic nexus itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the lever action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove lateral time—tightens when the 12-minute window collapses the fields; the price is the irreversible admission that Elise stays adjacent, not retrievable. One meaningful deepening suffices; escalation is linear, not multi-turn, but the magnetospheric clock makes pressure legible throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of scientific method and grief: the need to measure what love insists is still present. The final image—“beside me”—re-prices the entire quest without moralizing; the reader feels the conceptual cost of eternal adjacency rather than reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter—mechanically warm, lubricant under nails—and modulates rhythm: long twilight sentences contract to fragmentary data bursts during collapse. No head-hopping; lexicon remains within her engineering idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “lattice of light that looked like frozen breath” does double sensory-conceptual work. One paraphrase loop (“not hot, not cold, but something in between”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Time moves sideways” is freshly literalized through holographic magnetic interference rather than hand-wavy multiverse; velith as temporal navigators converts biological wonder into plot clock. Risk—using hard-SF concept to speak tender grief—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
