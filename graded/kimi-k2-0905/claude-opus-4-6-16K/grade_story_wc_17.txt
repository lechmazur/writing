<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. inheritor of “cursed” sensitivity—drives every beat: she records, then speaks to the wall, a micro-choice that seals her acceptance of the legacy. Embodied cost is palpable when pocketing the negative next to the stylus: she literally carries the burden forward. Grandmother’s diary excerpts serve as external pressure, not exposition dump, forcing stance change. Flaw risk: the final vow feels slightly pre-figured; still, the inherited ache lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Maren’s spoken promise fuses her voice into the corridor’s memory, reconfiguring her life-path with conceptual cost (she can no longer stay a neutral observer). Causal chain intact—crumbled brick reveals diaries → diaries reveal Elise → Elise’s theory reframes Maren’s work → Maren commits. Orientation crisp within 120 words; single-scene default honored. One transition (floor-level to chimney) is legible and motivated. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern holds: resonance density increases until her voice becomes the final added layer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Salt-warped hardwood, smoke-lace diary edges, ivy trembling in sourceless draft—each detail is filtered through Maren’s acoustic lens and nudges her next move. The spectrograph stylus and film negative function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: pocketing both objects physically links past and present, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her palm, knees, ash, pocket, wall without drift. Climate-shift frame remains background, but fogged emptiness sharpens stakes so never feels generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she shoulder or reject the ancestral sensitivity—signaled in para 1 and tightened when the diaries literalize the burden. One decisive deepening: learning Elise was forced out reframes the university from employer to antagonist, narrowing Maren’s safe options. Cost is felt: “legacy’s burden settled over her like the damp air itself,” an embodied price that forecloses denial. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates under Accumulative lens until her voiced commitment locks the path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as physical vibration—emerges through concrete images (waveform on film, footprints in stone) rather than statement. Subtext operates in silence: Maren never names her fear of madness, yet every sensory reference vibrates with that risk. Final image of her voice folding into the corridor’s hum offers non-literal answer: inheritance is not pathology but medium. Avoids moralizing; the walls remember, but what that means for Maren’s future stays tantalizingly open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual bias—“she could feel the architecture thinking”—without ventriloquizing Elise. Syntax lengthens during listening beats, then compresses into stark vow: “I’m finishing it,” mirroring shift from receptivity to agency. No dialogue, so evaluation rests on narrative rhythm, which remains controlled and idiosyncratic. Filter verbs (“she could hear”) are voice-motivated, emphasizing the curse/filter line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long, humid clauses echo corridor breath, then snap to ash, pocket, wall. High information density—each sentence performs setting-emotion-action triple duty. Figurative language sparse and accurate (“edges blackened to lace”) with no mixed metaphors. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; occasional adjective pairs (“salt air and subtropical storms”) are earned. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—“corridor echo cartographer” recording architectural memories—feels fresh yet inevitable in climate-abandoned campus. Combines gothic, cli-fi, and acoustic science without strain; specificity (Node 417, spectrograph stylus) anchors novelty. Transformation test fails: story collapses without these exact details. Risk bonus warranted: treating building as mnemonic vinyl could have slid into gimmickry, but emotional lineage grounds it.</comment>
