<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elena’s compulsive-gambler/professor contradiction is concrete—she converts monitor beeps into survival odds, maps subway glyphs instead of shuffling cards. Interiority is vivid, but the decisive shift to “uncertainty as point” is declared rather than dramatized in a single visible beat, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each subway glyph, lantern glow, and clover sprout layers density until the final notebook chapter crystallizes a Charged Poise. Closure reweights the premise—partial light is enough—with felt filial cost. Orientation is clean by word 80; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-washed library stone, mica-lit amber, and Green-line plastic seats are filtered through Elena’s probabilist gaze, constraining her route and final writing choice. The candle lantern’s “warmth without clarity” recharges the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether cautious scholarship can equal her father’s reckless vitality—tightens when she chooses halfway, annotated risk. Cost is legible: she forecloses the safety of full academic distance, accepting the lantern’s partial glow as enough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of contradictions—gambler’s ruin vs. professor’s odds, lantern’s glow vs. window’s view—without sermon. Final image of “wider, more honest dark” reweights prior motifs; no thematic echo penalty applies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elena’s probability metaphors, rain-as-statistics, subway glyphs as dataset. Rhythm tightens under stress—short clauses when monitors spike. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence advances atmosphere or stake; no scaffold loops. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid contradiction,” “conceptual repricing”) fits academic POV and is pattern-consistent. Closure beat is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The subway-cipher curriculum freshens the familiar “daughter outgrows father” arc; the lantern-as-uncertainty motif is simple yet non-generic. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
