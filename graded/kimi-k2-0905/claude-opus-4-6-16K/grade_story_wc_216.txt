<comment>Maren’s dying-battery interiority is vivid and embodied; the urn fragment as talisman anchors her need to “feel time’s grain.” The gathering of Sable and the boy crystallizes her mission, yet their arrival feels slightly convenient—no prior friction or cost is shown on-page. Still, her final renunciation of counting in favor of listening lands as earned stasis, pulse-paid.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the ticking silo reconfigures “duration” into something felt, not counted, while the implant’s old-number countdown persists as visible cost. Accumulative lens holds: each clock, each respondent, layers texture until the urn fragment sits “timeless at last,” reweighting the premise. Pattern taught early (garage-sale cipher) pays off when strangers arrive; no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The emerald silo’s mineral skin and refracted green shaft are not postcard beauty—they constrain action (light dictates sundial placement) and charge the final image of resin-held present. Micro-setting mastery: the urn fragment’s “bone-white curve” becomes the tactile pivot between hundreds of discordant clocks. Weatherless, but the silo’s internal light-tracker functions as environment-in-miniature, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve felt duration before cardiac expiry—is signaled inside 50 words and tightens when each new clock-owner arrives, narrowing Maren’s solitude into shared vigil. One meaningful deepening: the backward stopwatch and plate-sundial prove others suffer the same slippage, escalating collective stakes without external antagonist. Cost is the implant’s irreversible countdown, legible in the sternum pulse at close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: time as communal texture rather than metric authority. The urn fragment’s broken name becomes emblem of narrative refusal to complete—sequence survives even when numbers liquefy. No moralizing; final image of “present tense that refused to end” offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in garage-sale poetry (“keeps time the way rivers keep their banks: reluctantly”) deepens without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s perceptual altitude: mineral light, ticking skin, battery thump. Syntax lengthens and contracts like the fluid hours—“duration crystallize around her like resin around an insect” marries texture to stakes. No dialogue clutter; when Sable speaks it is reported, preserving lyric distance. Patterned diction (“grain,” “texture,” “held”) taught early and reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence layers object, metaphor, and stakes (“clocks disagreed with each other beautifully”). No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings prevent drumbeat. One mixed metaphor risk—“liquid and unnamed” sky beside “resin” hold—barely grazes clarity. Final line lands clean, no overwriting, earns high-band.</comment>

<comment>Post-Revision living mathematics and garage-sale cipher feel freshly synthesized, not gimmick: barter economy as last reliable postal system is sly social insight. Urn fragment of “Elid/Elidar” turns partial identity into ontological anchor—specific, irreplaceable. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into mood board, yet causality (battery death) keeps it urgent. Transformation test passed: swap clocks for any other artifacts and the whole fabric frays.</comment>
