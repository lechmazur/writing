<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s solitary vocation is vivid—her tactile ritual with the star fragment, her molars humming with the tower’s resonance—but the climb and listen cycle repeats twice without fresh stakes, so the final “begin again” feels incremental, not costly. Interior contradiction shows only once (“honesty the only instrument she trusted anymore” yet she keeps a fame shard), not revisited under pressure. Still, her embodied attention and the precise null-signal ecstasy make her memorable within the 800-word span.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard of hush answers, the towers momentarily sing, and Maren’s notebook entry crystallizes the cost—another open-ended pilgrimage—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift (tower, gorge, lunar perigee by ¶3) and the pattern of discard-assumption tuning is taught early, so the resonance crest feels earned. Only nit: no causal constraint persists after the 30-second pulse; the price is poetic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The city-as-broken-jaw, cables thicker than trunks, and moon swollen enough to taste are selective, POV-filtered, and directly guide her climb and posture. The corroded mesh platforms constrain every footstep; the star fragment’s brass catches final moonlight, recharging her faith. Spatial choreography is flawless; no two descriptions feel like filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the “shard of hush”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the dial slips past zero and the towers physically resonate, foreclosing the option to stay. Cost is the perpetual nomadism she embraces: “tomorrow she would move to the next ruin.” A second reversal or external antagonist is absent, but the internal tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: transmission/absence, fame/decay, ending/becoming. The star fragment’s reprise on the railing silently reprices her creed—signals outlive their medium, silence can be infrastructure—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful; the reader feels the conceptual cost even though Maren’s emotional palette is stoic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “low vibration that lived in her molars,” “architecture of silence.” Syntax lengthens during climb, fragments at signal peak, then settles into declarative logbook cadence, mirroring attention. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught (“broadcast nothing,” “seed of quiet”) and pays off in the final resonance. One scaffold loop—“she climbed… she set… she waited”—goes unvaried, a minor prop. No mixed metaphors or grammar slips obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of listening to structured silence inside dead broadcast hardware is fresh; the Walk-of-Fame shard repurposes pop-culture detritus as existential compass. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because cadence is controlled and closure stays legible. Without Maren’s specific vocation and artifact, the story collapses.</comment>
