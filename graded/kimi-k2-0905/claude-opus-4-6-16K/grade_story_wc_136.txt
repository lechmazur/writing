<comment>Sable’s grief-born vocation is vivid—her refusal to map the final corridor shows a lived contradiction. The “phantom punch” choice is the only beat where her interiority crystallizes into irrevocable action, paying the cost of abandoning her cartographer safety. Still, we never see her hesitate or fumble; the emotional tremor is asserted rather than embodied in micro-gesture, keeping the arc just shy of full earned weight.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: cracks → arrows → terminal → punch → corridor → mother silhouette, each step shrinking future options. Midnight stroke supplies the decisive temporal gate, making the final step irreversible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she forfeits documentation itself, a visible cost scaled to her life’s obsession. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where) is slightly late (~140 words) but the disorientation is paid off by the cathedral reveal, so only a hairline deduction applies.</comment>

<comment>Starlit vault fractures and mist columns are filtered through Sable’s mapper eye—geometry fetish meets cathedral awe, charging the setting with thematic tension. Track Nine’s railcar becomes a micro-setting whose leather-and-static tactile detail constrains her decision to board. The environmental metaphor (fortress of silence = rust terminal) is implicit, never declared, letting atmosphere do covert emotional work. One hairline slip: “clock began to chime midnight’s final stroke” edges toward cliché, but the chime is causally useful, not merely ornamental.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/face mother’s silence—rings from the first paragraph; the punch squeeze tightens it into a live fork: map or live the territory. Cost is legible: cartographer abandons her maps—an internal forfeit that alters her life’s method. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: each crack followed → arrival → punch use → corridor opens, no recourse. Coincidence is absent; discovery is earned by eleven years of prior obsession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of turning abstraction (maps) into lived experience (unmapped corridor). Silence as architecture is the central metaphor, reweighted when Sable chooses to inhabit rather than chart it. Subtext lives in objects: the punch’s bite pattern is a “key disguised as wound,” fusing tool and trauma without exposition. Final image refrains from moral; the starlit vault “holding everything and explaining nothing” is a resonant non-answer that reprices silence itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Sable’s perceptual sieve—geometric contours, fracture angles, starlight columns. Syntax lengthens and breathes during mapping exposition, then compresses into single-clause beats as she squeezes the punch, mirroring heart-rate shift. Diction (“fastidious devotion,” “analytically artistic”) is elevated but consistent with her cartographer grandeur; no register drift. One micro-loop: “maps… maps” in paragraph one, but the repetition serves as thematic drum, not scaffold, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long cartographic cadences to staccato corridor steps; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are physically coherent: “cathedral of rust and fog” marries material decay with sacred awe. Information density high—each sentence layers history, object, and emotional stake without padding. No loops or synonym churn; closing sentence lands on monosyllabic punch—“vaults do”—that recharges the title image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban-explorer cartography meets phantom-leg terminal, making grief-infused infrastructure feel inevitable. “Fortress of unspoken truths” as non-building convergence is a conceptual risk that pays off by literalizing silence into architecture. The mother-notebook silhouette reprise grows from prior seeds (unsent letters), avoiding late gimmick. Risk distinction +0.3: the premise could have slid to twee metaphor, but grounded tactile detail (punch teeth, leather smell) keeps it visceral.</comment>
