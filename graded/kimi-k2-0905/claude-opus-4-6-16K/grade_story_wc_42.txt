<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation as “repairer of seeing” is made flesh through every micro-choice: staying during quake, using cracked foundations as data, stopping the clock with her own finger. Interiority stays concrete (“leaf… ten micropascals”) and her refusal to leave lands as earned renunciation with visible cost—she forfeits escape velocity herself. Only slip: the director is a straw antagonist who never pressures her on-page, so status shift is assumed rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: hand arrests the runaway second hand, time resumes normal beat, cost is felt in the fingertip tremor. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each cracked lens, whirring tick, and comet image layers until the final re-calibration reweights “constant.” No causal gaps; every optical adjustment grows from earthquake damage she refuses to outrun. Director’s off-page skepticism is the single unmotivated node, but it never touches the decisive image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The volcanic summit, cloud deck, and star-tasting air are filtered through Maren’s professional attention; environment actively guides her tactic of using fracture vibrations as baseline. The deep-sky camera nicknamed “Memory” and the spinning wall clock function as micro-settings that constrain her final gesture. Only the daughter mention floats un-anchored in space/time, a bare name without sensory hook.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the ephemeral be witnessed despite ruin?”—tightens through each cracked optic; escalation is accretive rather than adversarial. The 17-degree tilt, lost comet data, and spinning clock cumulatively foreclose the option of perfect restoration, forcing her to rebuild through damage. Final comet image delivers the payoff: a new ephemeral captured, proving the stakes were real. Cost is felt, not declared.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: witnessing transience is itself a form of staying. No character moralizes; the comet’s “luminous ache” reconfigures the opening grief metaphor without naming it. Subtext resides in silence—she never speaks to the absent daughter yet the comet’s tail becomes the unspoken letter. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: arresting time is the price of preserving what passes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays latched to Maren’s perceptual signature: optics metaphors, micro-pascal precision, synesthetic “taste of starlight.” Syntax lengthens under calmer calibration nights, then compresses during the hand-stop beat. No head-hop; director’s skepticism is reported within her intellectual frame. The lyric elevation (“brushstroke of luminous ache”) is justified by her life-long translation of light into emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Sentence rhythm varies from long, wave-like calibration passages to the staccato “It whirred… she stayed… she listened.” Metaphors stay coherent (camera as memory, time as breath) and never collide. Only micro-slip: “taste starlight” is nearly cliché, but POV motivation lets it pass.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combining camera repair, seismic refit, and leaf-fall micro-acoustics feels idiosyncratic and inevitable. Escape-velocity trope is flipped: protagonist chooses capture over escape. Observatory-above-clouds setting is fresh lens on familiar “scientist versus bureaucracy” arc. Risk resides in lyric stillness, but accrual pattern teaches reader to value patience as action.</comment>
