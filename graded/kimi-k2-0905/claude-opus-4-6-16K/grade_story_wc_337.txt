<comment>Maren’s tremoring hands, her confession of pride-fuelled neglect, and the steadying of her grip while she unknots all embody a believable arc of guilt → self-exposure → tentative re-composure. Her interior contradiction—needing to atone yet fearing the net’s power—stays active in scene rather than summary. The only bar from 9-band is that the “fracture that lets something unwanted through” is asserted more than dramatized before tonight; a single earlier flash of her smuggling a cracked mask would have fore-wired the flaw into her body.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final breath without tremor crystallizes the before/after while the net’s centuries-long silence promises future cost. Causal linkage holds—each confession drives the next knot-release, which successively quiets Aldric’s scream and her own. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the slowed starlight image and the admission that she “would not be healed by morning.”</comment>

<comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its refracted starlight literally paints the only working surface and times the un-knotting beats, while the net’s accumulated weight functions as micro-setting that presses back against her hands. “Violet and silver” on her knuckles resurfaces in the slowed light of the penultimate paragraph, charging the final image. This passes the 9+ gate: environment constrains her tactile method and colors the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—can she quiet the spirits she loosed?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when each knot confesses a new fragment of guilt. Escalation is accumulative/textural: silence layers until starlight itself seems to decelerate, re-weighting the cost of her prior pride. The final stillness forecloses the option of immediate healing, a palpable price under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely through the net’s inversion: a tool once used to bind calm becomes the mechanism for releasing guilt-laden silence. Subtext resides in the hush itself—grief can be borrowed, stored, and returned, never erased. No sermon, only the image of slowed starlight, reconfigures the reader’s sense of absolution as a collective, ongoing process rather than personal cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s perceptual filter: starlight is “indifferent,” knots “drink quiet,” her hands “carry resonance.” Syntax lengthens during the un-knotting, mimicking the release of stored breath, then tightens into the final short sentence of calm. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; occasional elevated diction (“trembling geometries,” “interlaced hush”) is justified by craftsman’s precision rather than authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “silence poured from it like breath held for a century” fuses tactile and temporal in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; sentence length modulates to mirror inhale/exhale of released hush. Minor metaphor richness in the climax is pattern-taught early and pays off, not overwriting. Final line earns its resonance without syntactic drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of mask-restoration, net-knotting, and silence-as-substance feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no existing template combines these domains. The premise commits fully—spirits as literal acoustic residue—and follows the logic to a conceptual cost rather than retreating into metaphor. Risk is rewarded: the slow-light ending reconfigures grief-management from individual cure to communal burden-sharing, an angle rarely explored.</comment>
