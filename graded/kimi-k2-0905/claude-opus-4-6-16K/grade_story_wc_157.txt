<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s irreverent intellect and refusal to “think in beige” are vividly shown through her founding of Verek and the greenhouse subterfuge; the final choice to plant the Bureau’s own spy-seeds against them crystallizes her guarded spark with visible tactical cost. Interior contradiction is light—no moment where fear or compromise wars with bravado—so the arc rides on charisma more than wrenching choice, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: whisper → legislation → electrodes → Verek → gardens → seeded spy-gourds turned into counter-weapon. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Bureau’s surveillance network will literally bloom with encrypted sedition. Cost is legible in the single line “Every garden they infiltrate becomes another page of our dictionary,” foreclosing anonymity but weaponizing visibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s cracked glass, naphthalene air, and pinned moths create an immediate, tactile hideout whose very abandonment grants invisibility; later, the living gardens as “billboards” extend setting into tactical infrastructure. The moth-wing grammar motif recurs to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving untaxed thought—tightens when the gourd-seed microphone threatens the entire floral cipher network. Maren’s agency flips threat into amplification, a single decisive reversal that raises the cost of exposure while weaponizing it. Pressure is coherent but one-step; no secondary tightening beat, so ceiling stays mid-8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic resistance emerges through moth-grammar, garden grids, and the final perversion of the Bureau’s seed: freedom encoded in living matter. No explicit thesis—meaning grows from concrete choices. Final image of “something older and wilder” taking root offers resonant, non-literal answer to the premise’s tax on imagination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays latched to Maren, filtering description through rogue-scholar idiom—“restless appetite,” “billable categories”—and tightening syntax under threat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct. Minor elevation into near-epigram (“Verek isn’t something you learn…”) fits her candid-cryptic persona without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “cathedral of cracked glass,” “silence colonized the greenhouse.” No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language spikes only at reversals, then recedes. One scaffold phrase—“she thought about…”—could be cut, but it doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Taxed thoughts + moth-wing grammar + living二维码 gardens fuse into a premise that feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Bureau’s bio-acoustic gourd-seed twist escalates via biological logic already seeded. Risk in linguistic world-build pays off: the story commits fully, never defaulting to beige exposition.</comment>
