<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vael’s contradictory impulses—burying sight versus hunger for her mother’s tongue—are alive in every beat; the final release of her mercury-gift is earned by eleven years of shelving that severed the threads she now reknits. The feather-touch reactivation carries visible cost: the interior thunder of grief that “shakes foundations no one else could see.” Interiority stays concrete and mercury-bright, never drifting into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: substitute visions < night-shift shelving < feather ritual < accepting the world as it arrives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of substitution/burial/accidental re-seeding tightens through density shifts until the final cadence releases the substituted world. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the shape of home—finally legible”—a conceptual re-pricing that makes the before/after of grief’s alphabet legible with felt cost. No causal contradiction; feather-as-needle is seeded early in the owl-feather image, paid off as vinyl-stylus reactivation. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“the mountain had been a mountain…”) and spatialized through the nautilus-mine corridors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but tactical maze: its iron-air corridors force nightly detours that replace memory-routes, and the low shelf of atlases physically offers the stone to crouching knees. Micro-setting counts: the feather’s barbs catch grooves exactly like a stylus, turning stone into playable surface—environment constrains the reactivation beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—old-paper scent, iron taste, mercury shimmer—never tourist catalog. Final image is charged by the same granite walls now re-perceived as legible syntax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the dead language—tightens once: from buried refusal to accidental reactivation. Escalation is textural: density of substituted nights → density of remembered words → density of weeping-thunder inside her chest; the meaningful shift is the pattern-break of “she did not substitute reality.” Cost is legible: she pays by dropping the nightly shield that kept grief survivable, accepting the ache of its departure. Accumulative lens accepts this single deepening as sufficient; no external antagonist required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: home as syntax, not geography. Subtext lives in gesture—shelving books is a nightly burial of sight; drawing the feather is an unconscious re-enactment of her mother’s lullaby touch. Final image reweights the labyrinth from prison to legible grammar. No moralizing; “home was a syntax” is sung by the event, not declared. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels the barb-catch of recognition in the chest, mirroring feather-on-stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is mercury-liquid: sentences slide, reflect, pool—“futures pooling in rain puddles,” “mercury in her eyes stirred.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure: parataxis in the feather-stroke moment mirrors stylus-finding-groove. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within Vael’s plausible lexicon—she would name nautilus, barb, vinyl, atlas. Filter verbs are voice-motivated: “she felt nothing” is diagnostic accuracy, not excess filter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence does two jobs—world-build + interior reveal (“routes between sections had replaced the routes between memories”). No mixed metaphors; mountain-as-nautilus and feather-as-stylus are separate, precise. Loops zeroed: no synonym churn, no template cadence. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence for labyrinth descent, staccato for stylus-catch. Closure beat is clean: “finally, finally legible” gives cadence lift without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—mountain-sized bookstore as memory-labyrinth—is non-obvious synthesis of mining history and bibliophilia. Owl-feather-as-vinyl-stylus is a fresh mechanical turn that grows from prior particulars (owl country, buried sound). Emotional specificity—“grammar that organized love and grief”—prevents abstract anywhere-story. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is rewarded because closure image reweights all prior corridors as readable syntax. Could not swap feather, stone, or mercury-glass trait without collapsing mechanism.</comment>
