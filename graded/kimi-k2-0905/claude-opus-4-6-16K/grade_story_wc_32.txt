<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s stoic grief and paper-folding interiority are vivid; the final hammer-strike crystallizes her contradictory impulses. The “hopeless” epithet is shown, not told, through a decade of failures. Cost is legible: she breaks the very relic she was sworn to preserve, foreclosing her Keeper identity. Missing 0.3 because no secondary character tests her status, so status shift is implied rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: every beat obeys because/therefore—failed resurrections → crozier insight → hammer → shatter → new fire. Closure is a decisive change with cost: the ember’s rebirth costs Maren her inherited role. Orientation is clean by line 4; twilight and basin anchors are immediate. Persistent constraint: the broken crozier physically shapes the final tactic and reappears in the closing image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus is not backdrop but instrument: its spent coals supply the test subject and the orbiting shards reconfigure the basin itself. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s alchemical gaze—heatless coal, warped silver, blue-white frost. Micro-setting qualifies: the crozier’s crook provides the literal platform for the breakthrough. Only a sliver off for generic “twilight” without lunar angle or wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat entropy of dead fire—announced early. One meaningful tightening: the shift from preservation to destruction narrows her options to a single hammer-blow. Cost is visible on-page: sacred relic shattered, identity as Keeper ruptured. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates twice, hence not 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges through dramatized action, not lecture. The crozier’s twisted silver literalizes the theme; the final frost-bloom reweights it into creation. No moralizing sentence distills the lesson—meaning stays in the image. Ambiguity remains: is this rebirth or sacrilege? Complexity held.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a perceptual signature: “folded like paper,” “floodwater of hopelessness.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fractures into hammer-strike clauses. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Free indirect thought stays clean: “She had not saved the fire.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes—long cadences for dusk, staccato for shatter. Metaphors are selective, not stacked; “frozen bloom” returns with earned variation. One paraphrase loop: “beautiful in the way that endings are beautiful” could trim to “beautiful as endings are.” Otherwise zero scaffold, high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alchemical resurrection is familiar, yet the inversion—break first, ignite second—feels inevitable here. Risk: sacred object smashed on-page without off-stage safety net. Specificity of warped silver geometries prevents trope recycling. Fresh inflection crystallizes in the orbiting blue-white shards.</comment>
