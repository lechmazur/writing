<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s calm deliberate fisher nature is dramatized through the patience of the six-hour wait and the micro-choice to “voice silence”; the aching tenderness she reels in embodies cost without label-speak. One missing sliver: we never feel her interior contradiction while she braces—only steadiness—so the beat stops just short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captured verb pulses against her hip, reweighting the hunt; cost is the unshielded maternal ache she now carries. Accumulative lens holds—each echo-layer tightens the stakes—while the rail-spike tactic and zigzag path are set up, deployed, and paid off in one fluid arc. No orientation or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: basalt pillars, nodes, and standing-wave hedges guide every tactical move; the rail spike literally pins a wave, charging the final image. Micro-setting (iron spike, coiled line) constrains action and is refelt in the closing heartbeat. Only minor excess: “constellations sleepwalking” is vivid yet physically unmoored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the verb fragment—tightens once: the sky-pattern break triggers the catch window, forcing the costly silence act. Escalation is accumulative: each resonant layer crossed adds emotional density until the maternal ache surges; the price is immediately felt and alters her cargo. No false reversals; coincidence complicates but does not save.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of salvageable divinity emerges through tactile acoustics rather than statement; the feral lullaby reframes mercy as predatory tenderness, complicating the goddess myth. Final image refrains from moral summary, leaving the reader to weigh maternal hunger against cosmic care. A hair’s-breadth short of 9.0 because the verb’s exact significance is hinted, not fully repriced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains Maren’s cool, fisher-bred perceptual signature: “boots finding the nodes,” “line trembled,” syntax steady, rhythm patient. No head-hop; diction stays within her lived lexicon even when naming harmonics. Voicing silence is rendered through physical breath, not abstract gloss—proof of controlled psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet audible: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and tactical information without scaffold. Metaphors (“sky rearranging as though the stars had forgotten their choreography”) are purposeful and non-contradictory; no loops or filler adjectives. A lone滤波片: “something like mercy and something like hunger and something like…” triad borders on self-indulgence but reads as mimetic of echo fragmentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acoustic fishing for shattered goddess speech is a fresh mythic engine; the rail-spike-as-wave- anchor transforms ordinary iron into ritual tool. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the pulsing final heartbeat. Concept could not survive transplantation without losing its sonic skeleton.</comment>
