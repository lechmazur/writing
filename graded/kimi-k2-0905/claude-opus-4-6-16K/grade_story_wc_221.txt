<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—survivalist sketching vs. the ache of maternal exile—are dramatized in embodied beats (pressing the applique to her chest, opening the notebook). The final decision to sketch “tonight” costs her the last insulation of temporal denial; cost is legible. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak. Could use one micro-choice that risks reopening the temporal wound to hit 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dated star sketch layers temporal vertigo until the returned compass rose reweights “true north” as filial love. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she steps into shared time with visible cost: eleven lost years compressed into one fresh drawing. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens drift. One tightening beat suffices; satisfies quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is the dying dilation deck; its faint hum and curved viewport constrain every move and frame the final sketch. Micro-setting succeeds: the notebook, pencil, and tarnished applique act as portable geography that charges closure. Sensory selectivity (echoed silence, slow star crawl) mirrors internal dilation. Could push one tactile detail of deck decay into the last drawing motion to reach 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she re-enter her daughter’s time without shattering herself?”—tightens when the returned compass rose forces the choice: keep sketching isolation or sketch the shared sky. Agency visible as she opens to the same temporal plane at cost of ongoing temporal vertigo. One meaningful deepening meets length standard; cost legible. Lacks second beat of external opposition to crest 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: true north is not a fixed bearing but the person who keeps your compass rose. Subtext lives in the act of sketching stars no one else can see—knowledge as loneliness. Final image reframes prior sketches as love letters rather than data. Avoids explicit moral; resonance earned. Slight sentimental crest in last sentence keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly compressed diction matches stretched-time consciousness; perceptual signature filters stars as “slow rivers.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences under dilation, short pulse at rose reveal. One filter-verb cluster (“she had screamed for days. Then she had picked up…”) slightly dulls immediacy; else clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers time, object, or emotion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative control tight—stars “breathe,” silence “holds like deep water.” One tiny scaffold (“she cared that… she cared that…”) repeats structure but advances detail; minor. Closure line crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Time-dilation-as-maternal-exile feels fresh; trope flipped from physics puzzle to love story. Family custom of anniversary star sketches particularizes grief in way astronomy dataset cannot. Risk of lyric accumulative structure pays off. Slight echo of “glimpsed universe” motif from other sf stories, but transformed through maternal compass rose. Few more unique tactile details would push 9.</comment>
