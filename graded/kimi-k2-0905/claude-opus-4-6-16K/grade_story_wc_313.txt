<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s precise-humane trait is dramatized: she photographs, researches names, mounts the show—each a visible micro-choice that costs her the familiar silence she once kept. The absence of overt internal summary keeps her contradiction off-page, but her sustained, risky action under county eyes supplies a credible, scaled cost. Interiority is lean yet specific; the final refusal to re-hang the chime crystallizes a renunciation that feels earned. Still, no live second character pressure limits relationship crucible evidence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mute ridge and open-handed rooftops reconfigure county memory with undeniable social cost, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causal chain—silent chime → exposed town → photograph trail → public reckoning—tightens once but deeply, foreclosing the option to keep Harwell buried. Cost is legible in the final line: Maren surrenders the chime’s voice forever. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no disorientation serves the ending, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge, reservoir, and resurfacing rooftops function as micro-setting that literally constrains Maren’s choices: the falling water level enables the exhibition path, the mud’s apology sound slows her approach, the steeple becomes a way-marker. Twilight is used selectively to fold sky and water, charging the mirrored hush that ends the piece. Sensory triage feels professional-warden: gauges, silt, jar seal. All spatial cues remain coherent across the single descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—force the county to confront erased lives—emerges once the rooftops appear and tightens when Maren publicly pins names beside photographs, narrowing her own safety. Agency is continuous (collect, research, mount, refuse to restore chime) and carries visible social risk; no coincidence resolves it. One meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word scope. The price (loss of personal quiet, potential county reprisal) is legible but lightly felt compared with the thematic weight, keeping the score just sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—reservoirs hoard narrative, not just water—emerges through the rising rooftops and the trail of recovered faces; no character spells it out. The final image of rooftops as “open hands” reweights the premise, making 312 erased lives legible without moralizing. Subtext sits in Maren’s quiet refusal to re-hang the chime: endurance as accusation. Complexity remains: county benefit versus erased town is held in poise, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Maren’s perceptions; the lexicon of gauges, flood files, and census books feels warden-specific. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences on the ridge contract to staccato actions inside the storefront. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction bullet is waived. The final paragraph’s cadence—quiet now / mirrored hush / open hands—earns its slow exhale without overwriting.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “twilight that pooled along the ridge like something poured” does triple sensorial duty without crowding. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or action. One paraphrase hiccup—“mirrored hush” repeated in opening and closing—reads as deliberate resonance rather than churn. Register stays within a meticulous warden’s diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Drowned-town-resurfaces is familiar, but the inversion—town gazes back at the ridge—and the photograph-curtain installation feel specific and non-obvious. The sapphire liqueur label, re-seen in two photographs, supplies an irreplaceable local cordial that roots Harwell in orchard particularity. Risk is taken by keeping the climax curatorial rather than confrontational, yet coherence holds. Without these precise artifacts, the concept would slide into allegory.</comment>
