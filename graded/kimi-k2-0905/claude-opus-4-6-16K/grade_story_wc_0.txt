<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—scientist who strips emotion vs. woman who finally lets dust speak—grounds every beat; the phone-call micro-choice costs her prior armor and is earned. Grandmother and mother exist only in reflection, but the reflected pressure still bends her stance. Flaw (emotional detachment) directly shapes the cataloging/desisting pivot; no epiphany clichés, only embodied cost when she stops cataloging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: branching tide-lines of wing dust tighten the stake from abstract “decay” to tangible loss of family texture; final image (un-captioned photo beside pulsar graphs) is Charged Poise—she accepts a humbler, non-quantified meaning with the cost of academic pride visible. Pattern taught early; no orientation debt. Closure is quiet yet legible; cost pinned in “she had finally stopped cataloging.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse ruin anchors every choice—warped aluminum, silt reek, and iridescent dust on each surface drive her metaphorical gaze outward to galaxies. Body-as-setting appears in kneeling, tilting head, stirring breeze; the overturned clay pots recur as props handled while she decides to stop. Micro-setting (dust layer tinting light) directly charges the final image; without it the “golden warmth” and humility collapse. Detail never stalls momentum; each sensory hit also advances pattern recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether she will keep filtering life through models or let messy sentiment in. Pressure escalates as dust patterns echo cosmic filaments, compelling her to trade analytical distance for lived memory; the un-captured final pattern is visible forfeiture. Accumulative deepening suffices under the lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible on page: she abandons complete documentation—an irreversible professional lapse for a data-driven mind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: neutron-star decay vs. butterfly dust accumulation as rival ways of valuing time. No editorial commentary—insight earned when dust rearranges itself beyond her camera, forcing conceptual repricing of “meaning.” Final photo unnamed beside her equations crystallizes theme without moral. Subtextual tension between scientific grandeur and humble dailiness lingers after close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains disciplined academic diction then softens cadence as humility kindles; perceptual signature remains particular to astrophysicist mindset (“galaxy clusters she projected on her office wall”). No head-hop. Free-indirect slides cleanly from external description to interior inference. Sentence rhythm mirrors methodical observation early, loosens into longer, breathy cadence as she yields to memory. Dialogue line with mother is brief, naturalistic, sub-textual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is economical yet lyrical; figurative language avoids mixed metaphors—dust deltas/galaxy clusters parallel holds physical logic. No filler stacks or template cadence. Each sentence advances knowledge or texture: “floodwater had redistributed it into strange, branching patterns” simultaneously reveals setting, stakes, and scientific lens. Final third free of overwriting; closing image (“she had finally stopped cataloging”) delivers rhythmic punch without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—astrophysicist learning humility from butterfly dust—could slide to gimmick, but specificity of inherited greenhouse and granular dust mechanics keeps it fresh. Synthesis of cosmic and domestic feels inevitable in hindsight; neither thread would suffice alone. No trope recycling; avoids sentimental “dead relative” cliché via restrained eulogy abstraction and later apology. Risk of quiet ending paid off with Charged Poise image. Minor familiarity bump: flood-as-catalyst is common, but integration with iridescent dust rescues it.</comment>
