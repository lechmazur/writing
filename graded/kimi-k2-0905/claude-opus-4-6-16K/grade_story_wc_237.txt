<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is visceral—crystallizing scars reveal embodied fear without cliché. The crow-quill superstition anchors her arc from childish talisman to adult inscription tool, dramatized through micro-choices (first inhale of ghost-nettle, pressing nib to flesh). Contradictory impulses—terror of resonance vs hunger for grammar—co-exist in-scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of silence for self-authored syntax. Cost is visible: flakes of former armor dissolve in storm-wet air, scar now legible, path irreversible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the living inscription reconfigures her body’s meaning while the platform keeps turning beneath storms—cost felt, future unwritten. Causal lens holds: belief in quill → survives academy → becomes literal stylus; scar softening → flakes shed → new glyph readable. Orientation anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). Accumulation cap: none; 800-word limit respected, single scene, one deepening beat sufficient.</comment>

<comment>Floating basalt slab functions as micro-setting: altitude strips pretense, anchor-runes bruise-violet under storm pressure, gorge strata echo page-layers she now rewrites. Ghost-nettle bowl supplies tactile iron silence; crow-quill’s asymmetric tip constrains stroke width, determines scar-glyph precision. Weather curtain—moisture with weight—mirrors internal crystallization; external storm arrival synchronizes with internal lattice shedding, charging final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into legible story—signaled early. Tightening occurs when first inscription succeeds: crystallized tissue softens, foreclosing the option to remain inarticulate. Cost visible on-page: translucent flakes dissolve, flesh now bears readable glyph. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: bodies are texts whose wounds demand grammar, not erasure. Subtext carried by gesture—quill tracing scar, steam inhaled like unspoken syllables—avoids thesis statement. Final image withholds moral: storm continues, platform rotates, new sentence being written; ambiguity invites reflection on perpetual self-inscription.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual signature—bruised-plum light, iron-taste air, lattice-click soundtrack—never ventriloquizing beyond her ken. Rhythm accelerates with short, clause-light sentences as storm hits; lyric elongation during inscription breath. Crow quill’s reappearance is seamlessly braided into syntax, no template churn. No dialogue, hence dialogue bullets waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “anchor-runes so old their light had gone the color of bruised plums” fuses world-rule, visual, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or pressure. Figurative layer never muddles causality—storm and scar mechanics stay precise. Read-aloud ear: cadence modulates from hush-held vowels to hard-plosive storm percussion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tea-ceremony ritual with living-skin rune inscription feels inevitable yet fresh. Superstition-to-tool arc repurposes childhood belief into adult methodology without sentimentality. Gorge strata as unread book reweights geological time against personal history. Risk—storm-platform surgery on self—pays off in legible body-text that could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
