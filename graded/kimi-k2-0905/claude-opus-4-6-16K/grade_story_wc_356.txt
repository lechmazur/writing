<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—data-driven control vs. olfactory surrender—is dramatized in real time; the renunciation of hourly monitoring is earned by the seed’s stench and her sleepless cost. The final micro-choice—closing her eyes, not her notebook—crystallizes a visible forfeiture of former identity. “Think with your fingers” reappears as both inherited wisdom and act, so the endurance carries ancestral weight. No safety-hedging; her competence is balanced by genuine, mistake-driving blind spots.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doodled wrapping-paper image reweights “serenity within motion” from slogan to embodied stance; the cost is her abandoned pen, a tool she once clutched like oxygen. Accumulative lens holds—scent layers, doodle reprise, tide-turn hush—each intensifying the stake until the final exhalation reconfigures meaning. Causality is lyric but coherent: because she smells promise inside rot, therefore she stops quantifying. Persistent constraint established: she will lose sleep again if she slips back into metrics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The violet air, resinous bridges, and beetle sweetness are filtered through Maren’s professional nose; every sensory note doubles as diagnostic tool. The wrapped corpse-flower seed becomes micro-setting—its clay pot handled, opened, re-sealed—altering her tactics from measurement to surrender. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder → swaying bridge → worktable → pot → paper → eyes closed. Final image of “village asleep among the stars” recharges earlier canopy imagery, now seen from inside her new stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“quantify serenity”—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when the seed’s stench converts her goal into a test of surrender. One meaningful escalation: she chooses to bury the seed undocumented, forfeiting control. Cost is visible: the pen remains on the table while she breathes. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: data columns vs. doodle spirals, rot as invitation, not contradiction. The wrapping-paper custom reprises with new weight, offering non-literal answer: serenity is sketched, not calculated. No moralizing—wisdom is shown via odor and relinquished pen. Ambiguity lingers: will the bloom reek her back into insomnia?—a plausible counter-reading that complicates the peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, never leaking omniscience; perceptual signature is olfactory and synesthetic—“the air carried stories.” Rhythm modulates: long, breathy sentences mirror canopy sway; fragment “She understood, suddenly” compresses epiphany. Diction stays within her herbalist lexicon—pH, resin, heartwood—without jargon overload. No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs are active: “pressed her nose,” “breathed the wildflower hush.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances scent, thought, or motion. Mixed metaphors avoided—“decay threaded with something green” keeps botanic logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image. Information density high: one sentence layers dusk color, acoustic fade, and temporal shift. Minor scaffold: “she would not… she would not…” repetition is pattern-taught via elder injunction, paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—over-achiever learns to let go—is freshened by corpse-flower botany and olfactory POV. Treetop canopy village feels particular, not whimsical set-dressing; bridges grown, not built, imply centuries of slow cooperation. Doodle-on-wrapping custom is small but memorable, transforming throw-away paper into hereditary cognition tool. Risk taken: climax is renunciation of action, yet stakes stay legible through scent and sleeplessness.</comment>
