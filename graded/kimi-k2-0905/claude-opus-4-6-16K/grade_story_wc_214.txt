<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the “flourishing stillness” is shown via her micro-choices (holding glass, matching meteoric stillness). She earns a credible renunciation—refusing to report data—yet the cost reads as quiet rather than irreversible, keeping her just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: scene tightens through sensory density and pattern break (hovering meteor). Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren’s silence reweights her identity with implicit cost (job risk, epistemic exile). Orientation clean by 120 w; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Basalt ridge, thinning air, iron staircase, amber glass—each detail is filtered through Maren’s monkish attentiveness and constrains her stance. The station’s decay and meteor afterglow mirror her internal thinning/illumination. Micro-setting (glass) directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve intimacy with cosmos vs. institutional truth. Tightening occurs when anomaly demands data; Maren’s empathic silence forecloses official path. Cost legible but not viscerally paid on-page—no immediate consequence shown—holding it below 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: attention as defiant love. Subtext in her withheld reply to Dr. Luo crystallizes the stakes without statement. Final amber image reweights prior motifs—glass, starlight, stillness—into resonant hush. No moralizing; ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s idiosyncratic perception—Sufi echoes, tap-water offerings. Syntax breathes with her patient rhythm; diction precise (“telescopes gathered dust like prayer bowls”). No POV leakage; voice modulates under meteor shock.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary, metaphors coherent (“universe lit by firelight”). One scaffold loop: “stars fell and fell” near end. No mixed vehicles or filter stacks. Artifact stays clear of closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor trope inverted—custody becomes contemplative practice. Lantern glass as spiritual instrument feels fresh. Stillness concept given visceral twist via meteoric pause. Risk is quietness itself; payoff justifies gamble.</comment>
