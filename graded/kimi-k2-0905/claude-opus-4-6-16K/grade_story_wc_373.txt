<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—vengeful presence versus disciplined silence—collide live in-scene; the watch-fob micro-choices visibly price her stunt. Her “curiously steadfast” trait isn’t label-only: it dictates the false-start lure and the final wordless exit, foreclosing retaliation under the truce. Father’s absence and Harlan’s recognition moment are rendered through embodied gesture, not epiphany-speak. Cost is indelible: she carries off the sound of trust breaking, reputation intact, future paths narrowed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s wordless withdrawal crystallizes a social death for Harlan under the hush-truce, cost legible in his sagging silence. Each false start tightens the causal noose because market whisper-logic demands it; no teleporting information. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) sits at word ~90 and the taught disorientation (names forbidden) pays off at sunrise. Persistent constraint—the truce itself—shapes every tactic and the final exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rotting pier, algae-furred posts, and lantern-glint on fob create immediate tactile space; environment dictates entry/exit timing and the whisper-rule. Micro-setting of the fob constrains choice—its gleam is the only legal “name” allowed. Final image of paling sky and rusted ladder charges the departure with lingering damp threat. No caps triggered; specificity stays purposeful, never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing trust’s fracture—tightens through each feint; the fourth stall forces the private confrontation, narrowing options to silent presence or violence she refuses. Sunrise clock supplies visible boundary; cost is the future retaliation risk she now carries. Escalation is accumulative: each fob-glint deepens reputational stakes until Harlan’s recognition provides the decisive pressure shift. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both armor and weapon emerges via event, not lecture: the hush-truce, the withheld name, the auditory void after Harlan’s failed greeting. Final image reweights earlier arithmetic-of-silence motif—she exits carrying “the sound of silence breaking open,” a non-literal conceptual charge. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on whether she has freed or further caged herself. Subtext in gesture (fob spin, ladder climb) outruns any explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter: color-of-river memory, fob-as-rosary idiom, bayou humidity as moral gauge. Syntax contracts under stress—“She followed.”—then elongates during the baiting beats, mirroring control. No head-hop; Harlan’s interior accessed only through external collapse. Dialogue minimal, subtextual, appropriate to hush-law.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences pull double duty—“word traveled fast in a market built on whispers” advances both atmosphere and causality. Metaphors (trust like rotting wood) stay singular, concrete, paid off in Harlan’s sag. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical cadence for market description, staccato for climb-out. No filter-verb stacks; prop states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bayou pirate market under hush-law feels fresh; the revenge-via-silence inversion transcends typical confrontation tropes. False-start hunting method grows organically from setting rules. Transformation test fails—only this market and this truce enable the stunt—proving specificity. Risk in quiet ending is earned, not gimmick.</comment>
