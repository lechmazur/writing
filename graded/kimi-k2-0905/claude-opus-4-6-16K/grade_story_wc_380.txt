<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s buried grief and her quiet, methodical search for lost memory are credibly embodied; the moment she lifts off the floor crystallizes contradictory impulses (yearning vs terror of recall). Micro-choice—prizing the wildflowers free—directly triggers the return of memory, so the arc is earned. Cost is palpable: the gravity surge levitates her, literalizing weight of recovered past. Interiority stays concrete, though “whole at last” edges toward tidy shorthand.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravity pocket collapses, flames straighten, Maren’s blank years repopulate with felt weight. Causal chain—whale → crystals → gravity pocket → memory release—holds without gaps; each beat tightens options. Orientation is swift; lighthouse, pier, chamber anchors appear by line 60. Persistent constraint (sideways flame, hovering coin) shapes tactics and final image, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<comment>Harbor geography is tracked cleanly: dock walk, northern pier, evaporating basins, rib-cage crystals. Salt lattice that hums and mirrors pulse functions as micro-setting that constrains the final extraction. Sensory triangulation—salt breath, lantern glare, weight-shift underfoot—filters through Maren’s lantern-lighting routine, keeping detail purposeful. Final image of upright flames re-anchors world rules after surreal rupture.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased memories—surfaces in paragraph 5 and escalates as crystals enlarge and gravity warps. Mid-story tightening: coffee-ground directive forces midnight trespass, narrowing safe options. Protagonist’s act of prying crystals triggers irreversible memory flood, paying visible bodily cost (levitation, trembling). Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of voluntary amnesia and chosen remembrance emerges through salt crystallization and flame orientation rather than exposition. Subtextual echo—preserved flowers inside mineral ribs—implies burial can be tender, not only traumatic. Final circle image reframes earlier lantern circuits: repetition now carries recovered history, not empty ritual. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in silent upright flames.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: lantern glow fractures into “thousand stars,” crystals “remember” her pulse. Rhythm modulates—long evaporative sentences vs staccato “She went.”—mirroring tide-like pull of memory. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts convincingly during levitation. Diction remains within coastal-worker lexicon; only “whole at last” feels slightly external.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully (flame “like a question mark”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels: participial openings used only when actions are simultaneous. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt…”) but immediately compensated by tactile follow-through. Final paragraph lands with resonant cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-extraction via salt-crystal gravity pocket feels fresh, integrating maritime saltworks with surreal physics without drifting into generic magic. Whale-beach catalyst and coffee-ground divination are familiar tropes, but both serve the singular metaphor of crystallized grief. Specificity—lantern lighting routine, evaporating basins—grounds the conceit. Transformation test passes: story collapses if wildflowers or gravity anomaly removed.</comment>
