<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elund’s interior contradiction—obedient keeper vs. clandestine corrector—drives every beat; the blood she keeps shedding for the key embodies cost. Micro-choice of blowing the whistle crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible price. Final left-handed entry in the logbook shows earned change. Feels a whisker short of 9 because the “always been the one” twist is asserted rather than dramatized in a prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clocks restart under a truer measure, her blood still on the key, future rewritten—undeniable conceptual and bodily cost. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of hidden corrections, backward count, and whistle tear the membrane. Causality intact; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by ~120 words. One of the rare 600-word pieces where the final image reweights every prior line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt promontory, copper reservoirs, glass capillaries, and fjord-quiet water are filtered through Elund’s professional eye; each sensory pick later constrains her discovery or action. The horizon line doubles sky and sea, quietly mirror-staging the “doubled” time she unearths. Key’s razor edges split light—micro-setting that cuts her and charges the final turn. Spatial choreography clean; no object drift. Tool-as-setting satisfies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving navigational truth vs. facing the approaching future—tightens once: the backward count reveals convergence on an un-arrived date, foreclosing denial. Escalation is accumulative: incremental corrections, identical handwriting, and the key’s impossibility layer density until the whistle blow. Protagonist agency drives the turn; cost is the puncture in time and her skin. Meets high-band test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: measurement is an act of attention, not observation; attending to the present wounds but liberates. Subtext saturates the image of blood on a key that winds non-existent machinery—time shaped by unseen sacrifice. Final left-slanting script reconfigures identity without moralizing. Resonant, non-literal answer earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a perceptual signature attuned to minute hydraulic stillness and prismatic light-splitting. Rhythm modulates from fjord-hush long sentences to staccato beats at whistle blow. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Word choice stays within Elund’s observational lexicon. Meets 9- gate; minor reserve for one or two adjectives (“impossible sharpness”) that verge on abstract intensifier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description braided to interior pressure; no paraphrase loops. Varied rhythm mirrors mounting recognition. Figurative language sparse and exact: “sky seemed to continue downward forever” serves mirror-theme. Grammar and pronouns flawless. Final line cadence recharges left-slanting motif. Clean enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Hydraulic clocks measuring distance-to-future is a fresh temporal twist; key for a non-existent mantle clock deepens myth without exposition. Accumulation of identical handwriting across nine keepers feels inevitable yet startling. Specificity of northern fjord station grounds abstraction. Risk in stopping time via whistle pays off conceptually. Synthesis feels singular.</comment>
