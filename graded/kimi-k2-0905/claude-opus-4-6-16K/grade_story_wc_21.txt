<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam’s solemnity and archival drive are concrete from the first paragraph; her obsessive micro-choices (skipping meals, whispering to letters) embody the contradiction between scholarly detachment and visceral empathy. The final beat—she keeps touching the diary to witness, not to harvest data—earns her renunciation with visible cost: sleeplessness, tears, the unpayable debt of bearing witness. Interiority stays particular; no label-speak intrudes. The only minor slip is the off-page cipher breakthrough, but the emotional price lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Miriam shelves the letters yet keeps summoning the visions, crystallizing her eternal custodial stance. The lagoon-as-cipher key is a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior image; cost is legible in “she still pressed her fingers to the diary’s cover.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each immersion thickens density until the final refusal. One micro-turn (cipher solved) is allowed; it deepens rather than breaks pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The floating zeppelin-library is not postcard scenery; its “cool, lightless” archive shelf becomes the literal container for the settlement’s rescued memory, constraining Miriam’s final act of shelving. The obsidian lagoon’s shoreline is mapped into the alphabet, turning geography into epistemology—an environment that dictates tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: iron-gall smell, salt wind on scarred arms. Spatial choreography stays coherent across visions and present frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth-debt to the erased—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each vision: longer stays, bodily cost, final refusal to abandon witness. The cipher solution forecloses the option of passive curation; Miriam must become living witness. No coincidence resolves; the lagoon itself supplies both threat and key. Price is visible in trembling knuckles, skipped meals, and the sleepless nights that persist after transcription.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of preservation-as-possession: archiving can embalm or resurrect. The diary’s encryption literalizes how marginalized memory survives only through deliberate, loving obfuscation. Final image—Miriam still touching the cover—offers no moral, only the unbearable cost of custodial love. Subtext in the beach-debris messaging shows communication as both salvation and betrayal, complicating any heroic reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Miriam’s perceptual signature: cataloging instincts, conservation jargon, synesthetic smell of ink. Rhythm modulates—long, cathedral-like cadences drift into staccato heartbeats under vision stress. No head-hopping; visions are reported with the same sensory filter as waking life. Filter verbs (“she saw”) are voice-motivated, marking retrocognitive slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—zeppelin as “cathedral unmoored” sets tone without clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One near-mixed metaphor (“salt and volcanic glass”) but physical logic holds. Information density high: “waterlogged crate meant for Dakar” delivers setting, misrouting, and mystery in six words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating archive + retrocognitive cipher + obsidian lagoon synthesizes into a singular metaphor for memory’s burial and resurrection. The shoreline-as-alphabet is a non-obvious device that feels inevitable once revealed. No stock tropes; the “betrayed maroon community” is filtered through unrecorded specificity (Adinkra glyph, knotted-rope warnings). Risky structure—vision shards inside archival frame—pays off by making the reader complicit in witnessing.</comment>
