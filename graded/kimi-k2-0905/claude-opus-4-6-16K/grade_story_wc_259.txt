<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lien’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. transgressive empathy—are dramatized in the moment she uncorks the ampule; the embodied cost (tears, damp veil) makes the transformation legible. The final renunciation of Order loyalty is earned by the cascade of sampled griefs. Minor slip: “steadily unpredictable” is asserted once rather than shown through additional micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lien becomes a living archive, love replacing knowledge—cost is the saffron veil she will now wear as lie. Accumulative lens holds: each ampule adds density until the pattern break (“It was love…”) reweights the stake. No orientation debt; spiral descent is spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Bronze prism pagoda reappears at both thresholds, refracting light that mirrors the fractured memories inside; the archive’s downward spiral literally constrains her path and tactics. Micro-setting (ampule, lantern, veil) handled tactilely. One minor over-description: “fingers of a ghost” could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—remain Order-compliant vs. feel the dead—is signaled early and tightens with each uncorking; randomness-as-method forecloses systematic detection, a visible tactical cost. Final ampule #47 crystallizes the irreversible stance. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: history is not data but unpaid love. Subtext in “atoms of nostalgia” reframes empirical knowledge as ethical intimacy. Final line offers conceptual repricing—love outlasts civilizations—without moralizing. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“saffron veil,” “crystallized memory-fragments”) stays within historian’s scholarly register. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for descent, fragmentary images under ampule load. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—single sentences do world-building, sensory hit, and emotional turn. One mixed metaphor cluster (“copper light…fingers of a ghost”) slightly blurs physical logic. Otherwise clean, vivid, no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival prohibition + emotional pharmacology = historian as empathic medium. Risky second-person intimacy with extinct cultures pays off. Conceptual repricing feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative premise drag.</comment>
