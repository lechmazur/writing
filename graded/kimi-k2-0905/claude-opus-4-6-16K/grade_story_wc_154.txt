<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—numb surrender vs. compulsion to translate—co-exist in every beat; the final act of writing the coral-story is earned by her prior war-zone reflex to “ ferry meaning.” Interiority is embodied (coral pressed to lips, anesthetic tide) rather than labeled. The only minor slip: “shrewdly innocent” is asserted once, not dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the discharge instructions become a new “cast” for Ratu, visible cost is the ink on her own medical future. Causal chain holds: coral request → decrypting cast → writing story → sleep with price (unfinished pain). One transition (garden to memory bunker) is legible; no orientation debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of languages and scars tightens until the final image reweights damage as map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mist-clad atrium, coral ridges, plaster cast panels—each micro-setting constrains attention and later charges the final image. Fog behaves like IV drip, binding external weather to internal pharmacology. Spatial choreography is clean: table, phone, pen, nurse remain tracked. No credibility stumbles; Suva hospital details are spare but sufficient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she still translate pain into agency—tightens once: from passive decryption to active authorship. The deepening is her literal handwriting on her own discharge sheet, foreclosing rest. Cost is legible: anesthesia steals time, story steals recovery. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: translation as survival, scars as future cartography. Subtext lives in coral’s silence and cast’s smudged Pijin—no moral spoken. Final image of “small, porous heart” reweights prior damage without sermon. One hairline slip: “shared anxieties” is named in prompt echo, but absorbed quickly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is surgical-interpreter precise: “ferrying meaning between people whose languages had been shattered by the same bullets.” Perceptual signature filters every sense through bilingual muscle memory. Syntax breathes with anesthetic—long sentences liquefy, then shorten when she grips pen. No head-hop; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid fog clauses to staccato cast fragments. Metaphors are controlled: coral as “fossilized thought,” cast as “map of waters.” Zero loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“warm tide climbing bloodstream” beside “lotus-hearted ache”—but coherence survives because both serve drugged body. High density: each sentence layers scar, language, and place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise is familiar—war translator broken—yet angle of decrypting a child’s plaster pidgin into new myth is fresh. Coral fragment as future-text is specific, not symbolic prop. Risk: entire action is interior in hospital garden, but stakes stay visceral. Synthesis feels inevitable: interpreter rewrites body into story.</comment>
