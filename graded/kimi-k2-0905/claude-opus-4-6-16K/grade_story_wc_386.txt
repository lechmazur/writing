<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and interior contradiction—salvage as restitution, not profit—anchor every beat; the mirrored “window” motif externalizes her need to breach emotional ice. Emotion is embodied (trembling hands, prickling skin) rather than labeled. Yet the final beat leans on declarative summary (“she spoke Ailani’s name aloud”) instead of a micro-choice that costs her something tangible right now; the catharsis feels administered, not earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each dream transcript, object, and glint of candle-starlight layers density until the warped snow globe becomes the prism that reframes the official report. The orientation is swift—glacier shrine, candles, wet-suit peeled to waist by line four. Closure lands as Charged Poise: sealing evidence into the case crystallizes Maren’s new stance and carries conceptual cost (exposure, retaliation), charged by the prior image of Ailani pressed inside the glass. One minor slack: the “tomorrow she would surface” future-tell slightly blunts the present-tense immediacy of the closing image.</comment>

<comment>Setting is protagonist: breathing ice, borrowed starlight, candle constellations create a cold cathedral that forces Maren’s skin and conscience open. The half-collapsed snow globe functions as micro-setting—every warp catches fragmentary light and re-weights the meaning of “window.” Spatial choreography is clean; the case-sealing final beat is performed within the same crescent of stones and candles, letting environment witness the choice. One missed punch: temperature never visibly numbs dexterity or decision speed, a minor lost chance to let setting constrain tactics.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore Ailani’s silenced truth—clarifies early and tightens through accumulating evidence. Mid-story beat cross-referencing undeclared cargo drills a new hole in the official narrative, narrowing Maren’s options from curiosity to inevitable exposure. Cost is intellectual and moral rather than bodily; the invisible antagonist’s implied threat hangs, but on-page price is only prospective (“tomorrow…whoever would listen”). Still, the protagonist’s agency drives every escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation versus erasure emerges organically from salvage imagery and the recurring window/glass motif. No thesis statements; meaning accrues through juxtaposition of sealed-in porcelain girl and living woman sealed in ice. Final sealing of evidence case reconfigures the premise: truth is not liberated into light but packaged, handed over, with uncertain reception—an earned ambiguity that invites reflection without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; only the fisherman’s dream window is allowed a touch of melodrama, quickly offset by colder glaciological detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s perceptual filter: science-minded diver noticing vials, log entries, glints in warped glass. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses into tactile verbs (“peeled,” “sealed”) when action looms. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried by diction that melds technical precision with lyric metaphor—“borrowed starlight,” “porcelain girl…in a permanent reach toward nothing.” One clause drifts toward workshop cadence (“she hated the term”), but overall texture feels individual, not committee-averaged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythm-aware: paragraph lengths narrow like an ice fissure, mirroring tightening focus. Figurative layer is selective; metaphors (jellyfish dome, constellation ice) appear at pressure spikes and pay off visually. No synonym loops or filler stacks; information density is high—each dream citation both advances plot and colors atmosphere. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“cameo appearances,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register toward academic when stress peaks, a hairline slip but not enough to cloud the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The drowned speaking through strangers’ dreams is fresh, and framing the shrine inside living glacier literalizes the “cold case.” Corporate murder-by-negligence is familiar, yet the ghost-whisper methodology via crowd-sourced dream analytics feels non-obvious and specific to this narrator. Transformation test passes:换掉冰、潜水和梦境分析，故事骨架垮塌。Risk lies in lyric density, but it serves rather than decorates the concept. A tighter personal cost (frostbite? sponsor retaliation?) could push originality higher.</comment>
