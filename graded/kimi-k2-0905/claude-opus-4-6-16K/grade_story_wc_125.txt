<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the rope, the taste of starlight, the decision to “keep the braid” all feel earned. The contradiction between her hunger for omniscience and her loyalty to mortal sequence is dramatized, not declared. The only limit: we never see her genuinely falter or pay a visible price for the refusal; the cost is implied rather than felt on her body or future. That keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of choosing “the texture of not-knowing” reweights the entire cosmic offer with a single, legible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-mechanical, taught early by the rope’s history and mirrored in the star-spiral pattern. The lens holds without ambiguity; every beat adds density to the same stake—linear memory versus timeless knowledge. The price is unmistakable in the last line: “a universe that had offered her everything” watches her walk away from it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop; its curved wall literally receives the poem that seals her choice, turning setting into the manuscript of her refusal. Starlight through the jagged aperture is tracked as a moving lamp, keeping spatial choreography stable. The rope’s hemp fibers, the color of dried blood, echo the grotto walls, binding body, tool, and place into one charged micro-setting. Only the prison yard flashback is slightly less anchored, a 0.1 dock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure is singular and accumulative: the beings’ offer tightens from cosmic to personal as the being waits at the grotto mouth. The rope’s history supplies the middle deepening, turning an abstract dilemma into the felt texture of prior human risk. Maren’s final micro-choice—“I’ll keep the braid”—forecloses omniscience with a visible forfeiture. No reversals are needed; the single stake is simply weighed until it snaps into stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the unsayable sweetness of sequential mortality; no character ever names it. The rope’s used knots and the spiral stars reprice the same question—whether pattern requires breakage in time. The closing poem on clay is the thematic answer without moralizing: an image, not a thesis. Ambiguity survives: the reader can still feel the ache of everything she declined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, yet stays within a drifter-poet’s lexicon (“gas-station receipts,” “dried blood and old earth”). Syntax lengthens and shortens with the hum of the beings, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Maren’s body and metaphors. The one risk—occasional near-profundity—is undercut by tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense but controlled; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layering (“universe learning to stutter”) is earned by prior pattern. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. A single mixed moment—“ethically playful, the way a koan is playful”—leans toward abstraction, docking 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The alien-offer trope is inverted: the gift is knowledge, the price is narrative memory, and the refusal is voiced through a prison rope. Fresh synthesis arises from linking cosmic time to handmade craft. Risk is taken with lyric stillness in place of action set-pieces, yet coherence holds. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
