<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sable’s embodied potter-knowledge (clay-centering as life-practice) is vivid, but her turn from observer to steward drifts toward abstract benevolence; the climactic “sharp gentleness” is asserted rather than dramatized with a concrete, costly micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the oasis’s kindness-soaked soil reframes the premise, and the kiln-promise carries visible future cost (labor, water-sharing). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light-bands, plant tilts, and thrum reweight meaning; pattern taught early and held to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scorched wastelage vs. micro-oasis moisture is rendered through potter’s haptic gaze; the hive-box wood grain, cracked lantern glass, and lavender stalks anchor spatial choreography. Final image of kiln built on kindness-imbued earth satisfies 9+ gate: setting constrains next action and recharges motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why places refuse to die—tightens when sun-pattern reveals the oasis’s layered futures; agency is Sable’s decision to stay and fire pots, forfeiting nomad safety. Escalation is textural: each light-band adds existential density rather than new external threat; cost is implied future labor, but not viscerally felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of kindness-as-geology emerges through sensory particulars, not thesis; phototropism reframed as trophic memory is fresh. Final kiln image reweights earlier clay metaphors without moralizing, though sentiment flirts with softness—kept in check by wasteland context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains potter’s tactile idiom throughout; perceptual signature (“fingers reading wood grain”) stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice bleed; lyric compression is taught early (timeline lens) and paid off in sun-pattern sequence without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with daylight movement; sentences vary in length, no template cadence. Figurative language is spare, kiln-fired precise—“thin blade of shade,” “gray veil” of smoke—never overwrought. No loops or scaffold; information density high, each sentence advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-collapse beekeeping, clay craft, and quantum oasis is fresh; kindness-as-physics avoids eco-platitude. Timeline lens reprises familiar multiverse trope but grounds it in potter’s material gaze, yielding new emotional calculus. Risky lyric ending paid off via earned stasis.</comment>
