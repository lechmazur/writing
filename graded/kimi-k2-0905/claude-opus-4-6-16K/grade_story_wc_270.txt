<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable’s insurgency is concrete—each disruption (backward ink, sulfur flowers) is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority stays specific: “tradition with its teeth” vs. “museum exhibit.” Final renunciation—sitting in transformed springs—carries visible social cost (crews arriving tomorrow). Missing 9+ because we never feel her body under stress; scars are mentioned, not activated in the amber moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: amber dissolves, springs turn gold, committee due tomorrow—cost is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: kite-stone decoding → invocation → unsealing → environmental rebuttal to council. One smooth shard jump (hut back to pool) taught by repeated “return” motion. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hot springs function as micro-setting that alters tactics: temperature forces Sable to wade, dig, speak invocation over water. Volcanic copper color, thermophilic moss, and steam vents recur with shifting emotional charge. Kite fabric and amber are handled, not just viewed. Falls short of 8.8 because no environmental detail physically constrains the final unsealing—water color changes, but does not resist or complicate her action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of cultural narrative—tightens once: council’s standardized liturgy vs. Sable’s living amber ritual. Agency drives escalation: her decoding and spoken invocation foreclose the option of compliance. Cost visible in closing image—golden water that crews will inevitably confront. Could reach 8.8 if a tangible resource (reputation, freedom) were explicitly forfeited on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific images: printed-backward ink, sulfur flowers, amber dissolving into “remembering” water. Final sentence (“tradition is an embryo”) reweights premise without moralizing. Conceptual cost—reconstruction crews will criminalize her—lingers unstated but undeniable. Docked 0.1 for one near-abstract phrase: “conceptual repricing” risk in “pure potential.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Sable’s perceptual bias: she smells sulfur, feels chemical urgency, notices committee diction as “standardized prayers.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during dig: “She cleaned the stone and frowned.” No head-hopping; plant telepathy stays filtered through her body. Missing 9+ because occasional elevated diction (“temporal lobe,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily breaks rustic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences in pool, staccato decoding beats. Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs: “The reconstruction committee had declared these springs sacred again—but sacred according to their own revised liturgy.” No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One scaffold echo: “before the eruption, before the war, before the reconstruction” —acceptable anaphora. Could trim two adjectives (“oxidized copper”) without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusing plant telepathy, insurgent elder, and volcanic amber seed feels inevitable yet fresh. Kite-as-cipher reverses cliché of found-object prophecy. Risk-taking (lyric invocation, no creature burst) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test: swap amber for crystal or elder for teen—arc collapses; specificity is baked.</comment>
