<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s hatred of the orchard and her refusal to quit are shown through embodied action—teeth-threading the nut, shaking arms—so the renunciation at the end feels earned. The contradiction between resentment and rescue is alive in every beat; no epiphany is declared, only paid. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only limit is that the family remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dead grandmother → inherited curse → labyrinth incursion → blueprint rescue → frost-shortened network → shouted exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she turns back to the trees, voice hoarse, cost felt. The missing two resonance points leave a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and image. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, tool, and body converge: the sideways trunks, copper birds, and limestone channels actively mislead and must be worked around. The nut, membrane, and frame are handled in tactile beats that alter choices. Frost creep is tracked in real time, sealing the stone and forcing the final shout. The cliff-labyrinth is not backdrop; its acoustics and contraction dictate every move and the incomplete network that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get them out before frost—signals early and tightens with each resonance point. Agency is visible: she risks adding her own voice to the chorus yet keeps pressing frames. The twelfth success then the frozen thirteenth create a meaningful narrowing that forces the final human shout, paying with her literal voice. Cost is on the page; no coincidence resolves the rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: caretaking as self-inflicted wound—each saved life binds her deeper to the trees she loathes. The graceless beauty line reweights at the end: survival is ugly, necessary, and hers. No moral is stated; the image of her turning back into the frost-charged orchard carries the cost. Ambiguity lingers—will she ever leave?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is grim, tactile, compressed: “precision were an afterthought it happened to achieve.” Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices sound, cold, mechanical motion, never abstracts. Rhythm accelerates under frost pressure, sentences shortening as membranes freeze. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“frost crept across the stone like white fingers closing” mirrors both image and stakes. No synonym loops or scaffold. Information density is high: one line often performs atmosphere, action, and world rule. Minor repetition of “resonance point” is purposeful, pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cursed orchard that fruits singing stones, the acoustically carved cliff-labyrinth, and the resonance-frame network feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk is taken: a mechanical-bird surveillance orchard on a cliff face should be absurd, yet specificity and acoustic logic make it lived-in. Transformation test fails if relocated—every detail is welded to this place and voice. No trope harvesting; the premise commits fully.</comment>
