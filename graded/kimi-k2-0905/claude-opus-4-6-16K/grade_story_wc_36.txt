<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maret’s contradictory mix of reverence and scientific hunger is embodied in every beat—counting silence versus harvesting data from failure. The flute’s warmth against her hip and the deliberate placement of each water-logged branch externalize guilt, duty, and curiosity in one gesture. Interior refrain “failure is an open door” is tested when she decides to answer the caller—cost acknowledged in the final step through the slit. Voice never slips into diagnostic label; even abstract desire is shown via aching knees reading cloud pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is airtight: lost Lament → stripped title → systematic crossings encoded in driftwood → discovery it was summoned → choice to confront caller, all signaled by first 120 words. Closure lands as Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: she crosses, leaving a pointing bone-white marker that reweights “failure” into deliberate self-exile; cost is the irreversible one-way echo she now accepts. No orientation drift; world-rules (flute folds air, markers pull back) are consistent and pay off. Time and space remain cleanly choreographed across scree, ridgeline, and inter-world seam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is not backdrop but barometer—fourteen-day silence presses on her knees and decision to act. Micro-setting (satchel weight, scree shift, copper air on the other side) constrains footing and breathing, mirroring internal pressure. Driftwood cairns and luminous mirror-granite are tactile, GPS and lighthouse in one. Final image of pale marker against dark granite crystallizes both route home and the cost of perhaps never taking it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem catastrophic failure by understanding the crossing—tightens when she learns the Lament was called, forcing a live choice: retreat or answer. One meaningful escalation suffices: answering converts abstract research into irreversible confrontation; the price is stepping through without guarantee of return. Stakes stay personal, concrete, and causal under a Causal lens; no external coincidence dilutes agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “failure as aperture” emerges solely through action—counting silence, arranging return-signs, finally embracing the rupture. Subtext in the warm flute and water-heavy wood implies guilt as cargo she elects to carry forward. Final Charged Poise (she steps, range holds breath) reconfigures failure from shame to threshold—no moral spoken. Resonance lingers in un-echoed note and un-breathing mountain, inviting reader to weigh their own unclosed doors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is geologist-poet—angles, pressure, mineral glow. Compression like “avalanchingly quiet” and “sound folded inward” teaches lyric pattern early; payoff is closure hush. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly Maret-bound. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under flute-beat, mirroring pulse without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She arranged each piece deliberately: one long branch pointing northwest—toward the ridgeline, two shorter ones angled to mark descent” simultaneously shows ritual, encodes data, and foreshadows return path. Metaphors are spare, never layered; “hush so total it seemed ready to collapse under itself” renders silence tactile without mixed vehicle. No scaffold or synonym loops; high information density achieved through specific nouns (scree, cairn, copper-tasting dark). Final line lands with monosyllabic hammer—“it waited for her return”—earning cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines portal-fantasy trope with scientificmethod grief-work: driftwood as dataset, flute as escrow of collective breath. Missing relic answering back converts fantasy McGuffin into thematic mirror. World-lit mountain lit from within feels new because its function is measurement, not wonder. Risk in quiet, non-violent crossing pays off in lingering resonance.</comment>
