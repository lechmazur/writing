<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s compulsive heartbeat-counting is embodied every time she gives the number; the porcelain shard as both stylus and scar shows a constant micro-choice. The final beat—she stops counting—carries clear cost because the ritual that kept her sane is relinquished to claim “living.” Interiority stays specific and avoids label-speak, but the arc is thin on contradictory impulse beyond “keep going.” A second pressure (fear of systems re-erasing her) is implied, not dramatized, so motivation tops out just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the status flips to “living” yet the last image is the cessation of counting—earned stasis with felt cost because the obsessive proof is surrendered. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each ink page adds density until the final cadence shift (“she stopped counting”) reweights identity. Causality is intact—every database fragment is traced to an ink pattern she physically makes. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frost-glazed observatory dome refracts starlight into a “cathedral” that mirrors Maren’s vigil; snow weight and radio silence form a live clock that limits the satellite window. The porcelain shard acts as micro-setting, its curve guiding ink and literally scraping her past into the present. Environmental cold is filtered through bodily urgency—breath, heartbeat, ink viscosity—so description never stalls action. Setting constrains the final choice: only inside this analog relic can she overwrite the outside network.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove she is alive—tightens when the ionosphere window narrows; each spilled-ink pattern is an irreversible use of scarce time and body heat. Escalation is textural: static silence → clean silence → final pattern → status update; options narrow as the satellite window shrinks. The cost is visible: 308 heartbeats of stamina spent, ritual abandoned at the end. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal, but the deepening pattern sufficiently reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: a woman reassembles herself with the same systems that deleted her, so identity is shown as negotiable data rather than declared. The porcelain shard—once destruction, now stylus—embodies the wisdom-from-failure motif without thematic statement. Final image (“she stopped counting”) reframes prior beats: proof of life no longer requires enumeration. Subtext stays implicit; no moralizing line inflates the score to 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual filter—opal panels “like a buried eye,” heartbeat numbers, ink-branching “like winter trees.” Syntax tightens under pressure: clipped sentences during counting, longer fluid lines during ink flow. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge equals hers. Voice is distinct and maintained; minor rhythmic repetition in “each sequence… each pattern” is pattern-taught and pays off, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Strong noun/verb choices—“opal observatory,” “residual static,” “controlled rivulets”—carry description without modifier clutter. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay consistent (eye/dome, winter trees/ink). No scaffold sentences or synonym loops; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. One hairline slip: “digital ghost haunting her own life” edges toward thematic label, but immediate physical grounding (“locked out of bank accounts”) mitigates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The bureaucratic undead conceit is familiar, yet the analog hack via spilled-ink hexadecimal feels fresh and specific to this narrator. Observatory-as-interface and porcelain stylus transform standard tropes into lived procedure. Risk in structure—quiet accumulative beats instead of dramatic reversal—pays off with the final cadence halt. Could push higher with a sharper external obstacle, but within word count the synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
