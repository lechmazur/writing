<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cael’s quiet, meticulous resistance is embodied in every beat—rolling the pellet, dissolving the last grain on her tongue—so the renunciation of direct confrontation feels earned; the only bar to 9 is that her interior contradiction stays implicit rather than clashing aloud on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each annotated volume layers evidence until the final breath-borne rune detonates the lie, a Charged Poise that reorders the cosmos; the cost is the spent pellet and Cael’s erasure from record—legible in the closing “silence she restored.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s canyon shelves, weeping walls, and frozen constellations are not backdrop but tools—proximity dictates stealth, stone dictates ink source, oculus dictates escape route; the micro-setting of the pellet in her pouch finally constrains the climax when only one grain remains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pattern accrual: each discovered forgery deepens the jeopardy until the final Book of Ascensions confrontation forecloses any further annotation; the cost (pellet exhausted, name scattered) is visible, though pressure escalates by accumulation rather than a causal reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-erosion emerges wordlessly: drift-runes dissolve lies rather than assert justice, letting absence testify. The refusal to claim credit crystallizes the moral that history belongs to the page, not the hero—resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric sustains oracular cadence without head-hopping; diction (“stone that remembered languages”) stays inside Cael’s mythic register, and the rhythmic taper into the hushed final line mirrors the constellations resuming—voice as character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later utility (“weeping walls” = ink water). No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and pays off in the breath-born rune climax, so allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cosmic archive heist via passive erasure feels fresh; the rune-of-drift reverses typical heroic exposure, making absence the victory. Specificity of iron-gall chemistry and star-paused time locks the concept so it could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
