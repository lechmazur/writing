<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marguerite’s quiet, meticulous devotion is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—mixing ink to Elise’s recipe, speaking aloud to the photo, deciding to publish the covenant—each exposing the cost of her vocation. The “haunted euphoria” contradiction pulses in her body (aching knees, full heart) and motivates the final, public act that revives the dead promise. Interior contradiction is present but stays steady; no second impulse complicates the last beat, so the arc lands as steady resolve rather than wrenching change. Still, the cost is visible and character-bound, meeting the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—cataloguing “small moments”—and closure obeys it: the covenant’s rebirth is a density increase that reweights social memory rather than a causal coup. Orientation is secured by 120 words via the blooming jetty, kit, and dated covenant fragments. The final image (“the covenant breathed”) is a Charged Poise that makes the conceptual cost of restored obligation undeniable. Persistent constraint: once published, the town must confront the revived contract—no escape hatch is offered.</comment>

<comment>The walnut-ink vial, locket, and closing violet blooms function as micro-setting items that constrain choice: the ink recipe dictates the stabilization sequence, the locket’s gaze steels her resolve, the closing flowers mark time’s limit. Sensory triangulation (salt-jasmine scent, amber light on wet parchment) is filtered through archivist priorities. Spatial choreography holds as she kneels, lifts, photographs. Environment does not merely echo mood; it times her work and signals the twilight deadline that forces the final pack-up-and-publish decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will the covenant re-enter the world—tightens once: from private recovery to public documentation, narrowing her exposure and the town’s deniability. Pressure is textural, accumulating through each stabilized fragment until the last visible line demands publication. No external antagonist appears, but the inferred social pushback after printing supplies the future cost. The reversal is small but decisive; under accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the juxtaposition of small signatures against engineered erasure; no character sermonizes. The closing “covenant breathed” reweights all prior cataloguing labor into living obligation without moralizing. Subtext in Elise’s steady gaze and the richest family’s unspoken guilt invites counter-readings about class repetition. The emotional aftereffect is concrete: the reader feels the document’s new social weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Marguerite’s cataloguing mind: perceptual signature notices fiber, ink hue, margin curls. Syntax lengthens during meditative soaking, then shortens at pack-up, mirroring dusk compression. No head-hopping; Elise’s interior is unknowable, read only through the photograph’s “dark, steady eyes.” The archival register is consistent yet textured—“haunted euphoria” coined on the spot, not borrowed jargon.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from fluid list (“signature on a shipping manifest…”) to sharp final cadence (“The jetty bloomed. The water lapped. The covenant breathed.”). Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“tight fists against the coming dark” fits flowers and thematic foreclosure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or historical data. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The restoration-archivist reviving a drowned social contract through artisan chemistry is a fresh angle on the “recover lost justice” trope. Specificity of walnut-ink recipe and 1743 fishing covenant makes the concept non-transferable; swap materials and the plot collapses. Risk appears in the quiet ending—no courtroom scene—yet the final image confidently reconfigures social memory. Could edge higher with one more surprising complication mid-jetty.</comment>
