<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s “gently systematic” caretaker persona is credibly embodied in every tactile micro-choice; the interior contradiction between diagnostic fatalism and horticultural precision is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation of self-documentation on the altar stone is earned, but the absence of any second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible pressure. Still, her trajectory from observer to active negotiator of interspecies architecture carries visible cost in the removed wires and seated resignation among roots.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each copper-wiring session layers density until the orchard itself rewrites its own arches. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“island… temple orchard”) and the six-month clock is a persistent constraint that shapes every tactic. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living pillars’ new arches reweight the entire premise—mutual architecture outlasts the worker—while Maren’s seated stillness pays the felt cost of her exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment (the orchard’s living stone) literally constrains every tactical decision—copper placement, root threading, final posture. Sensory hierarchy stays tethered to Maren’s professional gaze: canopy angles, mineral output, microscopic channels. The final image of light “in columns of its own” recharges the setting back upon itself, fusing micro and macro scales.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecies architectural survival—tightens via visible root asphyxiation and the six-month human clock. One meaningful deepening: the shift from passive diary notation to active copper-wiring that softens stone. Cost is legible in Maren’s depleted stamina and the irreversible architectural rewrite she initiates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating imagery of negotiated stone and redirected branches; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of light through a self-healed canopy offers a resonant, non-verbal answer: mutualism outlives individual mortality. Subtext operates in the silence after wire removal—cooperation continues without the mediator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains clean distance; perceptual signature is filtered through botanical precision (“root spread, canopy angle”). Syntax tightens under pressure—short paratactic clauses during wire removal—and relaxes into longer cadences for the closing stillness. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is almost loop-free; one minor paraphrase loop (“she worked… she worked”) mid-story deducts −0.2. Otherwise high density: single sentences fuse sensory detail with causal pressure (“copper because it conducted the faint electrical signals…”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line varies rhythm to create breath-cadence closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-architecture as interspecies diplomacy, not eco-sermon. Living stone and copper-wiring bio-conductivity are specific, non-generic inventions. Risk—quiet ending without confrontation—pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than delivering spectacle. The premise would collapse if “temple orchard” or “lithite organisms” were swapped out.</comment>
