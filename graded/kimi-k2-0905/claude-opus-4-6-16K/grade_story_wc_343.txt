<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable’s “diligently curious” trait is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—chalking bearings, cross-referencing dog-ears, deciding to untether—each tightening the stake. The interior contradiction between obedience to Harwick and hunger for discovery stays implicit but legible. Final renunciation of safe mooring carries visible cost: she sails alone into fading light, foreclosing retreat. Voice remains individual, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: the tether is cast off, the ship vectors toward the cirque, exile chosen. Every causal hinge—phrasebook page → hopscotch grid → starling refusal → single bearing—threads cleanly to this irreversible act. Cost is felt in the bruised twilight and the letter left behind. Drive lens is causal; no ambiguity at terminus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Airship body, engine dust, chalked iron plate, and murmuration corridors are tactile constraints that shape Sable’s charting choices. Evening light “like spilled ink” is atmospherically apt yet never over-squints. Starling avoidances function as living instruments, directly guiding final bearing. Environment, tool, and micro-setting all charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the glow before rescue—tightens once when starling flight-refusals confirm the cirque coordinates, foreclosing passive waiting. Agency is intellectual (pattern recognition) but culminates in physical commitment (untether). No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic plus temporal (Harwick overdue). Cost is legible: solitary flight into unknown risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “attention as courage” emerges through cumulative particulars: child’s hopscotch re-read as scripture, birds as compass, apprentice choosing map over mooring. No moralizing; final image reweights prior isolation into voluntary exile for knowledge. Ambiguity survives: discovery may fail, but stance is irreversible. Resonance lingers without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Sable’s perceptual filter: “maps cannot say,” “pencil behind her ear.” Syntax lilts with cartographic diction—bearings, azimuths, portolan—yet remains limpid. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under decision pressure. Rhythm mirrors murmuration swells, then cuts crisp at final cast-off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and tested—“evening light pooled like spilled ink” grounds without purple. Information density high: each sentence advances chart, stakes, or atmosphere. Zero scaffolding obscures cause/effect; closure beat remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk airship, child’s hopscotch as cipher, and murmuration cartography into an inevitable-seeming whole. Risk taken: eleven-day solitude with no dialogue, yet tension accumulates through pattern decryption. Fresh inflection treats bird flock as living instrument, not metaphor. Transformation withstands relocation test; specificity is non-interchangeable.</comment>
