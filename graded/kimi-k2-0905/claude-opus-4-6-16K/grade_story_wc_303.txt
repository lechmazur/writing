<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Luelle’s contradictory impulses—scholarly rectitude vs. imperial complicity—co-exist on the page; the final, irreversible act of writing is earned by the prior beats of coffee-tree vision, plant-tremor cold, and the violin’s fading glow, so the cost is felt. One hairline slip: “she would not let the shepherd vanish” states resolve a beat early. Otherwise interiority is concrete, embodied, and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the pen-stroke crystallises a before (holes) and after (windows) with social cost implicit against an empire. Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and maintained—images layer (coffee tree, jasmine fear, ice-light) until the final cadence reweights the stake. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by line 5. One micro-loop: “promise…glow” repeated almost verbatim; does not blunt the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Observatory velvet, refracted starlight, and the violin’s chill function as micro-setting that literally steers the decision—she writes because the cold and shimmer grow unbearable. Selective sensory triangulation (sight, temperature, botanic whisper) keeps economy tight and stakes physical. Meets 9+ gate: the ice-crystal violin constrains the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once, meaningfully: from historiographic unease to the concrete choice—publish and risk imperial reprisal. Stakes are visceral (erased woman, stolen song) and escalate via the violin’s increasing cold and dimming glow. Accumulative lens shows density increase rather than causal chain; still, the final choice forecloses silence with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—who controls memory—emerges entirely through concrete particular: stained tree, jasmine fear, shepherd legend. Final image of “windows” reconfigures perforated destiny without moralising. One echo of prompt language (“perforated destiny”) appears, but occurs early and is immediately vivified by the coffee-tree vision; no sermonising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distanced third person remains stable; perceptual signature is scholarly-botanic (“catalogued lineages…jasmine murmured”) and grows taut under pressure. Syntax modulates: long reflective sentences contract to the final declarative “She began to write.” No dialogue, so no voice-contamination; filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with beats; most sentences carry double duty (information + atmosphere). Minor density cluster around “perforated destiny” metaphor—but pattern is taught early and recurs at closure, so forgiven. No scaffold, no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors in the climax. Read-aloud flow is near-flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ice violin + plant telepathy + coffee divination triad feels fresh because each device pressures Luelle’s historiographic moral crisis rather than acting as ornament. Risky lyric compression pays off: the shepherd legend is told in one sentence yet lands as lived history. Could edge 9+ with slightly sharper irreplaceability proof for the plant-telepathy beat.</comment>
