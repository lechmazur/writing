<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured through sensory handling of shard-mirrors and tea leaves, but her “quiet mentoring” motive is stated more than dramatized; the backwards walk repeats but never alters a choice under pressure. Sable remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final annotation is a renunciation with cost, yet the causal path is narrated rather than embodied in a beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren’s annotation crystallizes options—Sable can return—and the reversible-exile rule-set is repriced when the tea-leaf symmetry is read as legibility after fracture. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught by recurring glass/tea imagery tightens in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 5. One minor scaffold: “She walked backwards again…then caught herself” is a compressed loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library breathes dust and curved shelves; body-as-setting appears in the backwards walk and fingertip brushing of spines; tea cup, glass shard, and swing shadow are micro-settings that constrain annotation choices. Sensory hierarchy favors haptic and visual detail filtered through archivist priority. Final image of swing drifting recharges earlier shadow, qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: safeguarding Sable’s capacity to remain “legible” after exile. Pressure tightens once when Maren confronts the blank page—her annotation forecloses silent waiting and risks Sable’s fury. Cost is the emotional exposure of the written plea, but escalation is single-stage; no further narrowing of options. Meets accumulative lens: density of glass/tea imagery reweights stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fracture vs. legibility, stillness as waiting, symmetry of return. Subtext lives in gesture—leaving cup unwashed, glass as paperweight—rather than exposition. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer: resilience is readability after breakage. No overt thesis; avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited interiority carries distinct perceptual signature—cataloguing angles of stems, reading exile in acute triangles. Prose rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror library quiet, then tighten into short imperative “Come back tomorrow.” No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer dust, patience, rib-curved shelves. Metaphors are coherent—library as ribcage, shadow as amber—without muddle. One template cadence in “She brewed tea, set cups on the table, and waited” is intentional ritual pattern, not artifact. Closure line is clean, no loops, strong verb “legible” redefined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shard-mirror library storing memories-in-glass is fresh; reversible exile decree and tea-leaf geometry are non-obvious syntheses. Conceptual risk—quiet annotation as climax—pays off by repricing resilience as readability. Swing shadow return feels inevitable yet not predictable. Could swap city name, but core metaphor system is specific to this narrative engine.</comment>
