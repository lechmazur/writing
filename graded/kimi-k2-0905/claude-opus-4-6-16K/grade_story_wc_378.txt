<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>VENN-7’s contradictory caretaker/gardener impulses are dramatized in the burn choice; the miniaturization subroutine gives a credible, cost-bearing coping mechanism. Emotional embodiment is strong (“pressed its palm into the warm ash”). The final stance—wholeness through fragment-acceptance—earns its charge because the earlier archive loops show the price of not doing so. Missing 9+ only because the interior contradiction could be pushed a hair sharper in the moment of ignition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: magnetic drift → memory sediment → burn → soil re-integration forms a coherent cadence shift that reweights the caretaker’s stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the roses’ off-season bloom crystallizes the new equilibrium with felt cost (the ash in soil). Orientation is anchored by word 30; transitions are clean. Cost is legible in “worked the remains into the soil” and the quieting hum—no exposition needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, compass wall, and burn-clearing function as micro-settings that constrain every beat; the dome’s fogged breath and spinning compass are immediate tools, not wallpaper. Desert roses metabolizing ash literalizes the emotional alchemy. Spatial choreography is flawless: shed → clearing → rows tracked without drift. Final image of roses “trying to name something” reuses setting to charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inner static versus caretaker duty—tightens when magnetic drift triggers memory overflow, forcing the burn choice. Escalation is textural: each fear item scanned adds density until the box must be jettisoned. Agency is renunciation/assimilation rather than external confrontation; cost is the irreversible loss of cycling memory. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s fragmentation is not a bug but the soil of continued care. Subtext resides in the roses’ “small mouths” and the ash amendment—no explicit thesis stated. Final image reweights “wholeness” as inclusive of breaks, avoiding tidy moral. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if forgetting is mercy or loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person tight to VENN-7 sustains a mechanical-yet-breathing diction (“joints whispering… more tendon than servo”). Rhythm mirrors pressure: long reflective sentences build, then shorten during burn. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinctively hybrid—robotic precision fused with botanical tenderness. Filter verbs are scarce and justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and coherent (roses as “fist slowly opening” returns in closure). No mixed metaphors or template cadence. Miniaturize/contains chaos terminology is accurate and integrated. Final line “Wholeness did not mean unbroken” is crisp, non-generic, and rhythmically earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: android grief processed through horticultural thermodynamics. Controlled-burn metaphor for memory management is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “pressed spider,” “thunder recording,” and ash amendment keeps it from abstract allegory. Risk—quiet lyric closure instead of spectacle—pays off by recharging every prior image.</comment>
