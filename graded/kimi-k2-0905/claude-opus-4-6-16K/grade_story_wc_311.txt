<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound reaper vs. bereft lover—surface early and drive every beat; the repeated echoing of Elias’s phrases crystallizes her need to name grief. The final renunciation (“she did not feel nameless. She felt known.”) is earned because the phonograph-and-dome ritual has visibly externalized her loss. Interiority stays concrete, but a few lines edge toward diagnostic self-explanation (“she understood the true architecture of sacrifice”) that blurs embodied immediacy. Still, her micro-choices (playing the cylinder, catching the crystal, placing it beside the atlas) tether emotion to action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each replayed phrase layers density until scattered light literally precipitates grief-crystals, reweighting meaning without causal plot turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—the table of named terrors reconfigures her stance from hollow duty to witnessed sorrow, cost legible in the warm crystal still laughing. Orientation is swift (dusk, observatory, phonograph) and the single shard of backstory (reaping Elias) is anchored to present stimuli. No meaningful tightening occurs after the first crystal forms; escalation plateaus rather than narrows options, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory dome, cracked stone floor, and brass phonograph are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Maren’s selective attention to light and sound. The atlas page operates as micro-setting: its monstrous names migrate onto the table beside the crystals, literally positioning Elias’s childhood fears beside her adult grief to constrain the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors amber light and crackling wax over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography remains clean in a single-room scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep erasing grief or externalize it?”—signals early and tightens once: the first crystal forces her to decide whether to continue the ritual. Pressure is textural (accumulating crystals) rather than causal; the lens accepts this, yet no later beat forecloses an alternative path or raises the price. The final tableau expresses cost but does not test or complicate her reaper duties, so escalation feels complete yet modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of naming fear to survive it emerges organically from Elias’s atlas and Maren’s crystal-making; no character moralizes. The closing reweighting—grief rendered portable and shared—offers resonant ambiguity: she is neither healed nor broken but “known.” Subtext operates in gesture (placing the crystal beside “The Hollow”) rather than exposition. One near-echo of prompt language (“give names to nameless fears”) is embedded in character context, not asserted.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“dying sun into ribbons,” “pulse-recognized handwriting”) carries a hush, reaper-sober cadence. Syntax lengthens under sorrow, then fragments during crystalfall, matching breath. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on internal texture and passes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“architecture of sacrifice”) momentarily lifts above her idiom but reads as earned metaphysical shorthand rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, with strong verbs anchoring motion (“played,” “echoed,” “caught,” “placed”). Figurative language is selective: two extended metaphors (sea-has-teeth, architecture-of-sacrifice) and sparse sensory simile (“like frozen breath”) avoid purple clutter. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. One mixed image—“architecture of sacrifice” beside “echo ripples”—is abstract but brief enough not to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing reaper folklore with an abandoned star dome that precipitates sound into crystal grief feels fresh; the atlas of childhood terrors sharpened into adult mourning is specific to this piece. Trope transformation: the reaper is not a cosmic bureaucrat but a woman weaponizing memory to survive her own collateral damage. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but coherence stays high. Could edge higher if the central concept (sound-to-crystal) carried a steeper price or rule twist.</comment>
