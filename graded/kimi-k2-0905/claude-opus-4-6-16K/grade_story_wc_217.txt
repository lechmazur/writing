<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction is present—she clings to completion yet is drawn to fracture—but the poem’s failure never threatens an external stake, so her final acceptance feels like a gentle realisation rather than a costly renunciation. Micro-choices (saving the feather, starting to write) are visible, yet no consequence trails them; the cost is purely abstract. Emotional embodiment is strong in the kite-fall beat, weaker in the poem pivot. Still, the arc is coherent and earned under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the poem stays unfinished, a Charged Poise that reweights “woven dawns” from perfection to porous beauty. Causality is interior but legible: split feather → snapped kite → acceptance of incompleteness; each image accretes under Accumulative lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored inside 120 words. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, which caps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lagoon, drake feather, and kite function as micro-setting; the feather’s crook literally creases the notebook page, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (cobalt, burnished copper) filters through Maren’s poet-eye without tourist overload. Weather aftermath narrows attention to “last tremors,” guiding her metaphor shift. No props teleport; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she write a “whole” dawn poem?—is signalled early. Pressure tightens once: kite snap crystallises that beauty lives in breakage. The turn is micro, internally driven; no external consequence raises the cost. Sufficient for lyrical 800-word scope but thin for entry into 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges imagistically: fracture > wholeness. Subtext resides in objects (crooked feather, sunk kite) rather than exposition. Final “lantern” image offers resonant CR without moralising. Ambiguity is controlled; counter-readings (is incompleteness consolation or defeat?) stay plausible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric cadence mirrors tidal rhythm; clause length swells and recedes. Diction stays within poet-protagonist lexicon (“burnished hush,” “glass skin”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens exactly once around kite snap then eases. Patterned elision (“woven dawns” left undefined) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but patterned—water, light, fabric—without mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stake. One hedge: “something she could not name” is mild scaffolding, forgiven in 740-word piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Quiet-poet-at-lagoon is familiar, but the Accumulative use of fractured objects to unlock acceptance feels fresh. Specificity of colour shifts (bronze→green→cobalt) lifts stock “after-rain epiphany.” No derivative echoes; kite+feather pairing is non-obvious. Risk is modest, execution high.</comment>
