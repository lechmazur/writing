<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—driven archivist who burns reconstructions to protect “truth”—is dramatized through the tactile extraction of Isen’s letter; the moment kneels, trembles, presses paper to chest, embodying cost. The eleven-year pocketed tapestry and the act of setting fires are concrete anchors that externalize her flaw: fidelity through destruction. Closure earns renunciation of anonymity with volcanic tenderness felt on the page. Minor abstraction in “something molten…reshaping” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tapestry coordinates → descent → painting trail → slashed self-portrait → letter → vow to reopen archive; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is a Decisive Change: Maren chooses exposure-over-preservation, cost visible in “began the work.” Reflection blocks stay ≤20 % and tilt present stance (“she understood now why she had burned”). No orientation debt; single-scene descent keeps geography legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sulfur-air, basalt throat-shaped chamber, and polished-skull reflection are selective, POV-filtered details that guide choice—she notices what threatens or reveals. The tapestry fragment recurs as micro-setting, finally paired with letter against chest, charging closure. Crack of daylight “like a blade” mirrors the slashed canvas, integrating image and stakes. Setting never stalls momentum; every descriptor performs either atmosphere or constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake: preserve Vethara’s “crumbling real” versus institutional sanitization—signaled in para 1 and sharpened by each painting. Mid-story tightening: discovering the vandalized self-portrait forces the choice—stay hidden or expose archive. Cost is tangible in Isen’s gouged face and Maren’s trembling fingers; option to remain off-grid is foreclosed by letter’s imperative. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Preservation-through-decay theme emerges from fired replicas, slashed canvas, and final line “The crumbling was the point.” Subtext resides in gesture—burning museums is love, not rage. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from Isen’s self-vandalism as penance. Final reweighting makes crumbling sacred, reconfiguring reader’s prior disgust at destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile and mineral smells, scholar-skeptic diction. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences contract to “She sat… Then she stood” for closure propulsion. No head-hop; Isen’s mind accessed only through artifacts. One clause of abstract summation (“she understood it had never really been rage”) is earned by preceding embodied beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied sentence openings, volcanic metaphor cluster is purposeful and paid off, only two near-adjacent “she” stems. High density: “sulfur and old paper” doubles as sensory and thematic foreshadowing. No filter-verb stacks; “tasted,” “caught,” “caught” keep immediacy. Final line cadence lands closure without drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archive-as-ruin whose decay is the authenticity; arsonist-as-curator inverts conservation trope. Trail-of-paintings device personalizes exposition, avoiding data dump. Slashed self-portrait as message marries artifact and confession. Risk in off-stage prior fires is justified because causal logic and emotional cost still foreground the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arsonist identity seeds first paragraph, governs moral calculus, and authorizes final vow; without the fires, Isen’s plea lacks recipient specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tapestry fragment handled in opening, mid-search, and paired with letter at end; coordinates catalbate descent, reprise crystallizes promise fulfilled.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vandalized portrait is the concealed letter’s gateway; slashing embodies Isen’s self-indictment and triggers Maren’s decisive shift from secrecy to revelation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Trait shown when Maren senses absence of truth in forged bindings; enables trust in archive’s authenticity and justifies burning replicas.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Portray action of painting-cum-message provides the single indispensable reversal; no alternate object could deliver both confession and instruction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Six prior paintings create narrative propulsion; method mechanics legible via “each canvas…building like stanzas,” culminating in seventh reveal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive’s volcanic corridors and throat-shaped chamber physically constrain pace and house the final canvas; sulfur air signals authenticity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Off-grid years are recounted summary, not lived; still, timeframe creates stakes of anonymity now abandoned, providing cost tension for promise rescue.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rescue-a-promise desire drives descent, steers attention to paintings, and validates final public disclosure; friction with fear of replication is explicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Volcanic tenderness threads from “molten and immense” chest sensation through to closing ascent; tone modulates but charges final image of remembered promise.</comment>
