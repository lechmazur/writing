<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s decision to stay is rooted in her quiet obsession with the unheard melodies, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“she understood then that Elara Voss had engineered this”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The embodied cost—ruining her shoes, risking hypothermia—stays off-page; the choice to play feels inevitable rather than wrested from competing fears. Still, her micro-choice to memorize the vanishing face before leaving shows a concrete, character-specific hierarchy of values. A hairline slip from full 8+ because the final cost is more conceptual than felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moisture reveals reactive ink, each discovered note thickens pattern, and the final chord lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the opera now lives only in Maren’s memory. Orientation is swift (water at knees, lanterns, 1893 program by ~120 words). No causal break; the “ghost” is properly reframed as architectural resonance. A sliver shy of 9 because the closure beat (“Thank you”) is fading ink—cost is real but not yet tethered to future consequence for her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The flooded pit, lantern jitter, and water-warped paper are tactile constraints: water must reach exact height to finish the score, lanterns provide the only light to read vanishing ink. Micro-setting—the soaked folio pinned to the podium—literally pins Maren’s next action. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves while wading with violin case. The final image of the drying face recharges the in-between spaces motif; environment dictates both revelation and erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—complete the unheard opera—tightens once: water level enables the last hidden staff, then begins to erase it. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each soaked page increases density of discoverable notes, narrowing time to play before ink vanishes. Agency is legible—she chooses to play rather than flee, foreclosing personal safety. Cost is conceptual (memory burden) rather than physical; still fits Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art can be seeded in architecture to await a future collaborator, completion is an act of listening to absence. Subtext resides in the wordless conversation—no expository thesis, only the duet between standing waves and bow. Final reweighting: the opera is no longer lost but now exists solely in a single mortal memory, a fragile immortality. Avoids moral pronouncement; resonance lingers in the drying thank-you.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Maren’s musician ear: “phrases of music arriving unbidden,” “unstruck chords.” Syntax lengthens during the playing beat, mirroring legato lines; shorter sentences return as ink fades. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent (sound > sight hierarchy). Registers slightly over-lyric at times (“lanterns shivered”) but stays within poetic license taught by opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences lengthen during immersive play, then tighten for exit. No paraphrase loops; each image advances pattern or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—water “carried the sound” literally true in flooded acoustic. Minor filter verb (“she watched a new image surface”) but immediacy recovers in next clause. No mixed metaphors or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise is familiar (hidden score in old building) but transformed through reactive hydrochromic ink tuned to flood-plain certainty—an engineered latency that weaponizes time and weather. Specificity of acoustic architecture trapping “unstruck chords” gives fresh physics to ghost trope. Risky choice to make climax a quiet, solitary performance pays off via accumulative resonance rather than spectacle. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: of course the composer would use water as collaborator.</comment>
