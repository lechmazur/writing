<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is rich, concrete, and particular—her body registers the temple’s “resounding hush” as pressure on the eardrums, her motive to arbitrate cosmic illusion stays constant, and her micro-choices (opening the dictionary, setting it down blank) carry visible cost. The only knock is that the arc is more epistemic than volitional; she mainly witnesses and understands rather than alters, so the “change” feels conceptual, not character-forced. Still, the dictionary-as-memory-organ and the blank-page offering dramatize her relinquishment with embodied specificity, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared immediately (“she had understood…”) and held to the last line; closure is a Charged Poise: the blank dictionary on the threshold reweights all prior spiral imagery, making the cost of unified truth felt without exposition. Causality is lyric, not linear—each step outward demands a step inward—yet the pattern is taught by line 5 and paid off in the final image, so no orientation debt accrues. The one faint risk is conceptual overload at the climax, but the blank page anchors the abstraction in a tactile object, keeping the reconfiguration legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple is evoked through selective, pressure-driven detail: dust motes negotiate gravity, shelves stretch like ribs, the exit is “light-rimmed.” These images constrain movement (the narrowing corridors force the inward journey) and charge the final blank-page offering. Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating rooms—and the dictionary functions as micro-setting that alters tactics. Only the “sourceless” light skirts convenience, but it reads as intentional transcendence, not error, so the 9-band quick test is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusion” of separation—is signaled early and deepened through the spiral motif; the tightening occurs when Maren realizes history was “one event turning through different angles,” foreclosing the possibility of separate epochs. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she relinquishes the last lexicon, leaving its blank pages as evidence of forfeited meaning. Agency is largely contemplative, so the escalation is tonal/density-driven rather than tactical, keeping the score just inside the 8.5 floor for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the spiral image migrates from cosmic pattern to cognitive reconfiguration, culminating in the blank dictionary that silently answers the illusion-of-separation question. Subtext operates in gesture—setting the empty book on stone is a non-literal act that reweights every prior definition. No moral is asserted; the final image invites counter-readings (void as fullness, silence as speech). The conceptual reprice is earned through iterated particulars, satisfying the 9-band quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Maren’s perceptual filter: “resounding hush pressed against her eardrums like deep water” is sensuous, character-bound, and rhythmically controlled. Patterned diction (“wanderingly exact,” “spiral arbitration”) is introduced early and reprised at closure, creating coherence rather than affectation. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness is judged purely through narrative texture, which sustains a liturgical cadence without monotony. The only near-slip is abstract diction at the climax, but it stays within the established metaphysical register, so the high band holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere or cognition—“dust moved here not downward but in slow spirals” performs world-rule, metaphor, and mood in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; repetition is purposeful (spiral, hush, blank). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to the final terse “She stepped through.” Information is layered without padding. The blank dictionary’s final placement is the tautest possible closure image, earning the 9+ ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-human witness, lexicographic relic, and spiral epistemology feels fresh yet inevitable; the blank dictionary as coda transforms a familiar trope (last book) into a conceptual reprice. Risky choices—non-linear time, full-scene reflection, lyric abstraction—are taught early and paid off in the final image. No recognizable template or pop-culture echo. The vision is singular and internally coherent, meriting the bonus for risk that heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
