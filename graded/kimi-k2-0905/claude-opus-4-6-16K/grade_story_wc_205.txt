<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary fire turned scholarly persistence—are alive in every micro-choice: braving lethal time-storms alone, refusing to drape her own mirrors until the shard is safe, transmitting a “quiet” monograph that is still an act of insurgency. The cost is palpable: decades of erasure, physical risk, the final solitude of reading the walls aloud to an empty nave. Interiority stays concrete (“sorrow had burnished her…patina that made the underlying structure more visible”) and avoids label-speak. Earned Stasis lands cleanly: she forecloses any return to public glory, accepting luminous obscurity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ornamental detail, storm-draped mirror, and translated line layers density until the asteroid itself becomes the poem’s final stanza, reweighting the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren sits alone, voice resonating through abandoned halls, the cost—irrelevance, exile, possible temporal erosion—undeniable though not yet fully paid. Persistent constraint (visible time literally aging objects) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words and tighten through storm choreography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is not backdrop but instrument: colonnade spacing equals metrical feet, gilded cherubim serve as mnemonic scansion, time-pools dictate where Maren can safely crawl. Micro-setting—the shard glowing in honeyed time—literally steers her excavation path and final posture in the nave. Covered mirrors act as environmental circuit-breakers, constraining her storm-time movements. Final image of amber currents sliding past dark cloth recharges every prior ornate surface with mortal impermanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the Vasari were poets of impermanence—tightens when academic gatekeepers dismiss her only evidence. Escalation is textural: each newly decoded stanza in the architecture increases professional and existential jeopardy; time-storms threaten literal aging or erasure. Micro-turn occurs when she accepts that publication will not restore her fame yet she transmits anyway, narrowing her future to luminous solitude. Cost visible on-page: “defunct…still speaking, still luminous,” a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: civilizations and revolutionaries survive through the syntax of attention, not victory. Subtext coils in the irony that both Vasari and Maren are “defunct” yet eloquent—beauty as resistance to erasure. The shard’s shifting verses and the covered-mirror rite refract the central question—how to see time without being consumed—into every sensory channel. Final image answers with charged ambiguity: speech in an empty hall, sorrow transmuted to burnished patina.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices proportion as meter, hears gilded silence, feels temporal currents “thick as honey.” Diction—“calcified,” “baroque,” “patina”—is precise to her scholarly idiom without ever drifting into academic exposition. Rhythm lengthens and contracts with storm pressure; sentences grow clausal when time thickens, then fracture into single-image clauses at the close. No head-hopping; every metaphor is something she could literally see or touch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “time pooled thick as honey and glowed with centuries” performs sensory and expository work simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each ornamental phrase adds new information (mirror-draping as both ritual and safety protocol). Variation in sentence length mirrors temporal surges; paragraph breaks fall at perceptual shifts. One clause borders on purple—“cherubim carved from iron ore watched her with hollow eyes”—but it pays off when the same statues later serve as scansion markers, so leniency is granted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of visible time, baroque archaeology, and forgotten-revolutionary POV feels inevitable yet unprecedented; no trope checklist here. The asteroid as palindromic poem converts ornamental excess into ontological foresight—a reweighting that reframes “decadence” as epistemic survival. Risk: 700-word single-scene lyric reliant on architectural metaphors; coherence never wavers, payoff undeniable. Specific detail (shard micro-engravings, mirror-draping mechanics) prevents abstraction; transformation test fails if names or places change.</comment>
