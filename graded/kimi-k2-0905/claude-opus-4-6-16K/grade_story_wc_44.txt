<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s “quietly deliberate” nature is shown, not told, in how she copies glyphs, measures starlight, chews every crumb—gestures that pay off when she relearns the loops with bleeding fingers. Interior contradiction is slight but present: scholar’s pride vs dread at scholarly collapse. Final choice feels earned because her meticulousness both enables her to decode the key and traps her into activating it; the cost—her shadow lengthening toward the thing she fed—is visible on the page. Misses 9.0 only because we never see her truly misread a rune under stress; competence edges out flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: bent cutlery → scrambled runes → seized orrery → key discovery → loop grammar → automaton awakening. Each beat narrows options until only activation or permanent paralysis remains. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: her returned shadow points at the creature she nourished, reweighting the meaning of “scholarship” as complicity. Orientation, lens, and cost all on-page; no ambiguity or soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory dome, rotating on thermal columns, is not backdrop—it forces a 360° sky-scan that lets Maren chart shadow-disappearances across azimuths; the same mechanism jams the key. Brass-and-bone key’s spiral runes are handled, turned, matched to paper loops; their texture dictates her finger-ache. Final image—“shadow stretching toward noon”—uses the floor plank grain as micro-setting, making the cost literal underfoot. Irreplaceable integration earns the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single stake—stop the world from unravelling—tightens when every noon steals more shadows. Escalation is knowledge-driven: each loop she closes on paper vibrates the key harder, a haptic countdown. Agency sits squarely in her decision to close rather than smash the key; cost is the automaton now rising on her watch. One minor drag: the creature’s scale remains abstract until the final line, muting visceral threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge-as-feed emerges wordlessly: the same glyphs that enlighten also nourish the predator below. The shadow’s return is a conceptual repricing—what she sought (answers) becomes complicity. No moral sermon; resonance arises from the inversion of “catalog” into “sacrifice.” Slight deduction for abstract threat keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains quiet, scholarly diction—“quietly deliberate” is the controlling cadence. Syntax lengthens under calm observation, shortens when gears jam: “The key began to vibrate.” Perceptual signature is star-angled: light arrives “late,” spoons curl like “fiddlehead ferns.” No head-hopping, no register drift; final image sentence is clean, unadorned, letting the shadow speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with Maren’s pulse: long sentences for copying, staccato for seizure. Figurative density is high but patterned—spirals, loops, ferns—so it teaches its own lexicon rather than overwriting. One paraphrase loop detectable: “not from scratch, but from some place worse than scratch” could trim. Otherwise zero scaffolding; information dual-loaded in every line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “reality glitch” trope and grounds it in amateur scholarship—bent spoons as data set. Sealed awakening concept is resurrected from dusty footnotes, given mechanical bite via orrery jam. Fresh synthesis: runic grammar = recursive feeder circuit; final shadow direction inverts hero arc into complicity. Risk of abstraction accepted and paid off by precise closure image. Feels inevitable in hindsight—hallmark of genuine invention.</comment>
