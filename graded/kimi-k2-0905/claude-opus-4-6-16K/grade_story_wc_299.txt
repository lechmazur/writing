<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—clinging to “facts” while the cloth re-ignites grief—is dramatized in two beats (inventory vs. inhalation) and culminates in the pocketing micro-choice that costs him professional detachment. The flaw (emotional evasion) directly shapes the final renunciation, meeting the 9+ test, but the backstory block edges past the 20 % soft cap, keeping it sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the scrap’s “unquantifiable” re-prices his entire valuation system, felt cost legible in throat-tighten + pocketing. Causal chain holds: because he appraises → therefore finds cloth → therefore reweights meaning. Orientation anchors by line 5; lens (Accumulative) stays coherent; no artifact touches the final image.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s echo is not backdrop but tactical constraint: it literalizes his shouted facts returning hollow, priming the final image where pocketing the scrap externalizes the same acoustic law—sound/value comes back altered. Micro-setting (desk drawer) constrains the discovery beat; calcium dust scent persists as chemical witness. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can emotional safety survive factual mastery?—tightens once: the cloth forces a trade-off between professional-distance (negligible market value) and grief-admission (priceless). Escalation is accumulative not causal, but density spike at cloth reveal reweights options with visible cost (pocketing = foregone objectivity). Sufficient for form.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the equation of value = negotiation between object and need; the ending’s refusal to quantify is the non-literal answer. Subtext sits in silent inhalation and the absent smell—grief registered by missing data. No moralizing; resonance is oblique yet unmistakable.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature—antiques diction of “coordinates,” “liturgy,” “specific gravity”—threads every paragraph without register drift. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses at cloth reveal, mirrors pulse spike. No dialogue, so voice remains un-contaminated; compression (“calcium dust and old coffee”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence carries dual duty (e.g., “calcium dust and old coffee” = scent + occupational cue). Metaphor chain (quarry/swallow/sound) stays coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line “wide, unanswered afternoon” is spare yet propulsive. Artifacts absent from closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The antiques-roadie hybrid profession is fresh synthesis; the speaker cloth as fossil-of-grief reverses expected valuation logic. Risk—reflection-heavy mosaic—pays off because closure reweights the premise rather than explains it. Could not swap names without breaking the causal lattice of auction-house shame + band lore.</comment>
