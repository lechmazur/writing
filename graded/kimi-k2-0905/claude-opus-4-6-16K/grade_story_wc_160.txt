<comment>Maren’s contradictory allegiance to duty and mercy is dramatized in every tactile beat: her hands tremble, she tastes iron, she coils the chain as if binding herself. The decision to recalibrate the gates is earned by the cumulative micro-choices—scraping adhesive, overlaying schematics, pocketing the envelope—each one visibly raising the personal cost. Interiority stays concrete (“throat tighten,” “guilt pooled”) and avoids diagnostic gloss. The final image of her steadying her hands on breathing stone crystallizes an earned, dangerous stance that forecloses the “maximum throughput” path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: the envelope triggers the discovery, the chain encodes the alternative settings, the adhesive test proves village complicity—each beat a because/therefore linkage that tightens Maren’s options to one inevitable act. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no later drift. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost: tomorrow’s illegal recalibration and the pocketed residue of Elias’s gum make the risk tactile and immediate. No plot amnesia or soft resets; every object’s state tracks cleanly (chain coiled, envelope pocketed, tools selected).</comment>

<comment>The breathing volcano is not backdrop but agent: its mineral exhalations widen cracks that mirror Maren’s widening moral fracture. The brass instruments, sulfur air, and dripping condensation are filtered through her engineer’s gaze—every sense note doubles as technical data she could use to hide her sabotage. The surveyor’s chain functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its exact 66-foot length overlays the schematics she will alter. Final image—her hand on basalt that exhales—fuses body, tool, and environment into one charged poise.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—village survival vs. consortium output—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened by each decoded link. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maren realizes the two-percent output sacrifice is the only remaining merciful option, foreclosing neutrality. Cost is legible: she accepts criminal sabotage with tomorrow’s wrench. No coincidence; every escalation grows from her agency under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: mercy can be engineered into iron if the machinist is willing to bear personal risk. The encrypted compassion motif is embodied first in chain etchings, then in adhesive residue, finally in the coil she will carry to Gate Seven—each return reweights the stakes. The ending’s non-literal answer is the pocketed envelope gum, a quiet emblem that future punishment is now inseparable from her act of kindness. Complexity lingers: she is neither saint nor traitor, only a technician who chose dappled resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual engine: “tasted of sulfur and old iron,” “fractions of millimeters.” No filter-verb stacks; syntax tightens under pressure (“She rolled the chain into a coil and set it beside her wrench kit”). Basalt walls “deciding whether to smile” is personification she would never articulate, but the slight poetic lift is justified by her inherited mystic awe of the caldera. Voice never drifts into committee exposition; every metaphor is tool-bound or geothermal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density (“numbers corresponded to floodgate calibration settings, but not the ones prescribed”). Sentence rhythm alternates between long calibration clauses and short, breath-tightened fragments as pressure builds. Metaphors stay coherent within geothermal/mechanical domain; no mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines are propulsive and image-locked. Copy-clean: pronoun “she” never ambiguous, tense stable, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The thermal-works-inside-volcano frame and mercy-via-tolerance concept feel inevitable yet freshly combined. Encoding benevolence into obsolete survey chain links is a specific, non-obvious invention that would collapse if replaced. Transformation test fails: swap volcano for generic dam and the breathing-stone metaphor that charges closure disappears. Risk is taken and paid off—the story commits to quiet engineering sabotage rather than explosive revolt, letting the insurgent act stay hidden in plain sight.</comment>
