<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solenne’s contradictions—chaste courtesan, patient rebel—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (barefoot snow crossing, thread-sorting by trembling touch). Interiority stays embodied: “palms stung with cold” cues resolve without label-speak. Final smile costs her protective opacity, earned by years of withheld body and voice. One flaw: the Mistress’s motives remain off-stage, so the interpersonal crucible is hypothetical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each collected thread layers echo-density until the golden charter-thread triggers an irrevocable pattern-break. Orientation locked by word 60; causality intact because broken threads “lose echo,” making the untangle ritual necessary. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the House’s legal frame shatters with the Mistress’s own voice, cost visible in Solenne’s barefoot exile into open snow. No lens ambiguity; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting: crystal facets refract both light and power, enabling the echo-amplification that rewrites the House’s rules. Snow-muffled courtyard supplies sensory narrowing—cold bite, perfect footprints—guiding Solenne’s stealth and marking her passage from property to agent. Selective detail (starlight ribbons, linen rasp) anchors texture without catalog bloat. Setting directly constrains the final tactic: only inside the pavilion can the thread-key sing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep body/voice unappropriated”—intensifies as each thread collected raises exposure risk. One decisive tightening: stretching the golden thread between facets turns possession of a secret into public sabotage, narrowing her option from silent harvest to audible revolt. Cost is legible: once the echo releases, her insider camouflage is gone. External antagonist stays abstract, but internal stake scales to collective liberation, satisfying the 800-word horizon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet refusal emerges through image-pattern: withheld song vs. resonant thread, snow’s mute page vs. undeniable charter voice. Subtext in “yield, mirror, please” lullaby reframes obedience as erasure; Solenne’s silence weaponized into archive. Final reconfiguration shows autonomy won not by shouting but by curated memory—an insight that reweights every earlier stolen thread. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Solenne’s perceptual filter: vocabulary of texture, color, vibration—never abstract ownership. Syntax lengthens during delicate untangling, then compresses into the short final smile, mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moment) still fits a courtesan trained to poetic speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty: “snow settled on the edges of the prism sanctuary” simultaneously paints scene and foreshadows echo-landing site. Figurative control tight—no mixed metaphors; “frozen lake of light” is singular, apposite. Rhythm breathes: long clauses for slow untangle, staccato “She stepped out” for release. Zero loops, filters, or scaffold; high information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar “courtesan with secret” frame is transfigured by thread-echo mechanic and architectural acoustics, making memory a literal skeleton key. Harvesting lint-level ephemera for revolution feels non-obvious yet inevitable once enacted. Risk-taking in quiet climax—no chase, no blade—pays off via conceptual detonation. One minor echo of Atwood’s Handmaid lullaby keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
