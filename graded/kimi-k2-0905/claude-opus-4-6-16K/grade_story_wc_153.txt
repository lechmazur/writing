<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—grief, rage, filial hunger—are kept alive and embodied in every poling stroke and cracked envelope; the final acceptance of a stone that nightly re-breaks is earned because her earlier refusal to mail the letters has already bled on the page. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choices (breaking seal after seal while the glass answers) visibly reorder her hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: the mother remains dead, the letters are now empty, the shard’s fresh fissures are promised at dawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the boat exits the labyrinth carrying “a broken thing that knew how to mend,” reconfiguring the stake from forgiveness to devotional repetition; the price—perpetual re-breaking—is legible in one line. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each opened letter tightens the pattern of condensation replies until the final image crystallizes. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored within 90 words. No lens ambiguity; the moon-cycle rule is taught early and returns to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mangrove roots, tidal breathing, and floating candles are not backdrop; they narrow the channel until Maren can no longer turn the boat away from the medium’s platform. The gargoyle shard’s micro-setting—cradled in palm, weeping moonlit water—functions as movable scenery that constrains the final choice to accept cyclical damage. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s urgency: hymn-tone presses her sternum before any visual catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the pole, box, candles, and clay bowl never teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“Can she still be heard?”—is signaled in paragraph four and deepens when the medium states spirits “evoke what the living have buried,” forcing Maren to trade hope of maternal reply for confrontation with her own buried voice. One meaningful tightening: the shift from reading letters to speaking the unwritten; each condensation phrase narrows future denial until silence itself becomes the cost. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. The price—lifelong cycle of breaking/healing—lands on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief is not a wound to close but a devotional practice of reopening. Subtext lives in the shard’s nightly repair and relapse, mirrored in Maren’s choice to keep the fracture alive. The final image reweights all prior letters as rehearsal for an apology that must be spoken again each dawn. No moralizing, only charged ambiguity: love and hurt coexist in the same breath, neither victorious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s perceptual filter—cathedral bones, hymn pressing the sternum, condensation blooming like breath on glass. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her pulse; clauses fragment when the first maternal phrase appears. No head-hop; medium’s dialogue is externally observed. Diction stays within Maren’s plausible lexicon while allowing lyric elevation that feels earned by the spirit-haunted locale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or sound. Figurative layering is dense yet precise—“tones that pressed against the chest like a hand holding a cracked thing together”—and never recycles vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to the clipped “It breaks again every dawn.” No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines function as tuned bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The unsent-letters device is familiar, yet its pairing with a moon-healing gargoyle shard and condensation medium is fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Spirits that sing instead of speak, a labyrinth that breathes with the tide, and a ritual that mends stone only to re-break it at sunrise—all transform trope into specific mythic logic. Risk is taken: no ghostly maternal apparition, only water-glass handwriting; the refusal to grant catharsis becomes the new devotional. Transformation test fails if names are swapped—details are irreplaceably welded to this mangrove theology.</comment>
