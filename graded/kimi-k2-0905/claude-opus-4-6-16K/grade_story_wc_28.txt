<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selin’s interior contradiction—needing to feel others’ grief yet armoring herself in “steel discipline”—is dramatized in the single gesture of pressing the tessera and speaking the name; the cost is the haze that never fully lifts. The micro-choice to cradle Oren’s despair while renaming the silence shows a hierarchy of values with visible price. The only limit: we are told the retrocognitive trap “hollows” her, but the present-tense ache is asserted rather than embodied in breath, pulse, or tremor—so the steel reads slightly cooler than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: uttering “Dahra” reweights the mosaic from broken fragment to spoken memorial, paying the conceptual cost that Oren could not. Causal chain holds: because Selin reads the hidden name, therefore she speaks it, therefore the pull loosens—an earned release under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“ancient plaza”), well under the 120-word cap. No lens ambiguity; the final image of blue tiles glowing “almost alive” crystallizes the reconfiguration with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plaza’s fractured dome and loose tessera are not backdrop but tool: the chipped glaze is the literal interface Selin must decode, and its cobalt-gold pattern constrains her choice to speak the name. The shattered sky re-enters as the final light-beam that charges the mosaic, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment shapes the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: fountain center → kneel → press → stand → next stone. One minor slip: “boots” appears twice in the same sentence, a tiny scaffold echo that keeps this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Selin release Oren’s grief without losing herself—tightens when the tessera reveals the cost of renaming: the magistrate’s mercy that erased Dahra. That deepening reweights Selen’s own discipline; speaking the name becomes the single, irreversible act that forecloses her clean exit. The price is legible: “the retrocognitive pull release, just slightly” and the sorrow she now “carries willingly.” Pressure is coherent and accumulative; no reversal is needed under the lyric/texture lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy made radical when given steel structure—emerges through the mosaic’s hidden name rather than assertion. The final spoken word reconfigures silence into history without moralizing. Subtext resides in the father’s embedded grief and Selin’s voluntary adoption of that cost. The only tick toward platitude is the phrase “empathy unhoused was just sentiment,” a touch too thesis-like, keeping this just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-historical (“feeling where the glaze had chipped…in patterns that told her things”). Syntax lengthens under retrocognitive immersion, then shortens at release (“Dahra.”), mirroring cognitive load. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. One filter stack—“she felt his despair soak into her like rain into dry earth”—is earned by the lyric mode and does not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “a fractured dome of ash and light, cracked like porcelain dropped by a careless god” packs image, mythic scale, and emotional tone in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances history or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (porcelain → architecture → naming). A single scaffold echo—“She had learned to use this. That was what made her dangerous, and that was what made her gentle”—repeats the “that was what” cadence; the slight template feel nicks 0.1, holding this at 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The retrocognitive archaeologist who speaks erased names through mosaics is a fresh synthesis of psychometry and memorial activism. The “aberrant mercy” of renaming a child to save yet silence her father becomes the moral knot that only Selin’s gift can untangle—an angle not templated in familiar fantasy or literary plots. Risk is high—an almost entirely reflective, single-character scene—yet the payoff reconfigures history as living architecture. The specificity of tessellation encoding a forbidden name feels inevitable in hindsight, meriting the high band.</comment>
