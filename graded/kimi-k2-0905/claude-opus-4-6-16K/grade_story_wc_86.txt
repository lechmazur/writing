<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—pragmatic negotiator versus ritual-believer in sacred space—is embodied in the brass pull she fondles while bargaining. Her father’s suicide is recycled into a live tactic (the lunar calendar) that forces both armies onto an unownable clock, a credible conversion of guilt into leverage. The cost is felt when she pockets the warmed pull after Dashev leaves: the same object that once anchored despair now anchors strategy, foreclosing the option of mere transaction. Voice stays coherent; no diagnostic shorthand intrudes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat moves because/therefore—Grosz must testify → moon schedule forces parity → nine-day clock begins. The drawer pull acts as tether between paternal failure and Maren’s counter-method, paying off in the final gesture. Closure is a Charged Poise: nothing explodes, yet options reconfigure under an indifferent moon and a human artifact now repurposed. Cost is legible in the “heavy with purpose” heartbeat against the brass, a private price neither army can quantify.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet’s bare stone, the wind pressing like a hand, and the mist that swallows vertical space all constrain movement and sight, making the ledge a natural confessional booth. Micro-objects—the lantern she douses, the brass pull she warms—function as portable setting that alters tactics (steadies her hand, signals history). Spatial choreography is clean: steps ascend, mist closes behind Dashev, valley waits below. Environment is not backdrop; it is the neutral third party that obliges both sides to speak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can acknowledgment be extracted before exchange—tightens when Maren stakes the entire timetable on lunar neutrality, forcing Dashev to adopt her clock or break talks. One meaningful escalation: the moon calendar converts an abstract demand (truth about Verdaine) into a concrete, non-negotiable schedule. Protagonist agency drives every increment; no outside rescue or coincidence intervenes. The cost is the nine-day exposure both armies must endure before final trade, a delay that could rupture either command.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of neutral ground: not a place but a temporal rhythm no nation can own. The drawer pull’s reprise reweights “remorse without direction is just drowning” into “remorse with direction is a calendar.” Subtext lives in silence—Dashev picks up the pull, says nothing, yet concedes the timetable. No moral is stated; the final image of mist closing like a door offers resonant ambiguity about whether apology will ever arrive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren’s perceptions: wind presses “like a hand urging her back,” brass tastes of patina, mist erases vertical depth. Syntax lengthens for reflection, shortens for tactical beats (“Full moon is in nine days”). No head-hopping; Dashev’s exhaustion is read off his face, not interiorized. Voice carries a chilly, ecclesiastical cadence suited to a parapet turned confessional.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long reflective sentences yield to staccato negotiation lines. Information density is high—each sentence advances setting, history, or tactic; no scaffold loops detected. Figurative language is spare and tested: “wind press[es] against her like a hand” matches physical stakes; mixed metaphors absent. One near-loop: “remorse without direction is just drowning” is paraphrased once, but the second iteration converts the idea into action, so penalty waived.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar war-truce setup is reanimated by lunar clock and relic object repurposing. Moon-as-neutral is fresh; drawer-pull-as-instruction-manual fresher. Risk is taken: quiet ending instead of burst of gunfire or release, yet resonance lands. Slight debit: parapet neutrality trope is common; still, the temporal twist lifts it above template.</comment>
