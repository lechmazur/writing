<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Margot’s altered cognition and post-stroke restlessness are rendered through embodied, idiosyncratic perception; the parasol cane, NGO gambit, and listening stance all flow from a single interior contradiction—seeking death’s frequency while continuing to act. The final turn back to the supply tent costs her the immediate encounter with the “sound,” yet the cost is felt because every prior beat has tied her identity to that listening. One taut beat of internal conflict—eyes closed on the ice, hum in the chest—crystallizes the hierarchy: curiosity > annihilation. No diagnostic self-talk; even the “euthanasia tourist” label is spoken by the world, not her mind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the resonance is re-experienced, meaning is re-weighted (“knowing the melody did not mean you had to sing it today”), and the path forward is foreclosed yet open-ended. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic or tactile fragment layers until the final hum reconfigures the stakes. Causality is intact—the stroke preview motivates the NGO detour, the parasol tapping literalizes her new epistemology—and no beat is elided that the word-count cannot bear. Cost is visible in the refusal to step off the dock, forcing her back into labor that now carries the sound inside it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop; its unstable planking and groaning slabs shape every step she takes with the parasol, literalizing “gripping reality loosely.” Brass forget-me-nots against grey-white ice become the charged micro-setting that constrains her final choice—tapping twice before turning away. Cold, wind direction, and distant calvings are filtered through stroke-altered latency, so environment mirrors cognition without declarative symmetry. Spatial choreography across pontoons and cargo zones remains exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hear the sound again without dying—tightens once: the marina wind delivers the hum, forcing a decision now, not someday. Under Accumulative lens the pressure escalates through density of auditory/tactile hits until the final pattern break (turning back) reweights cost. No antagonist needed; ice and wind supply coherent external pressure. Price is immediate—she forfeits the consummation she travelled north to taste.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—how foreknowledge of ending changes living—emerges through concrete recurrence of sound and lace, never asserted. Subtext operates in the parasol’s double duty: elegiac ornament and blind-woman probe, implying both memorial and navigation. Final image refuses both suicide and denial, offering instead “small percussion into the remainder,” a non-moral resonance that invites counter-readings of courage or procrastination. No platitudes; the hum is left untranslated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Margot’s post-stroke lag: colors “provisional,” sounds “half-second late,” lexicon retrained to her former precision yet now syncopated. Non-standard but taught early, paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to the staccato “once, twice” tap. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature remains unmistakably hers throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic: “folded her patience into a neat square” compresses backstory and gesture. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats (silt river / wind rigging). sentence variety prevents drumbeat; single-word fragments (“Not to die. To learn.”) serve urgency. Artifacts are absent; even the faintly ornate “vowel the world was trying to pronounce” is justified by her pre-stroke eloquence surfacing under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Euthanasia tourist seeking death’s soundtrack through NGO disaster relief is conceptually fresh; parasol-as-cane in Arctic pack ice supplies indelible visual signature that would break if swapped. The “fold in patience” reframes stoic cliché into tactile origami of time. Risk—lyric stillness over plot reversals—pays off because pressure is internal and accrued. Could edge higher if the NGO milieu had one specific detail impossible outside Svalbard.</comment>
