<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—her gift for sealing thresholds versus her inability to open one—drives every beat; the memory of her husband’s shrapnel line is embodied in the tightening of her throat and the deliberate stillness when spores land. The final micro-choice (“Show me again”) crystallizes a credible, costly shift from detection to permeability without therapeutic self-labeling. The only minor slip is a trace of diagnostic summary (“she’d suffocated whatever lived inside”) just before the spore contact; it slightly blurs the embodied arc at the hinge moment.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the dome’s breathing walls reconfigure Maren’s emotional rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she lets the morning in while remaining whole. The causal chain (laser → visible permeability → spore release → internal shift) is tight; no off-stage teleportation or retro-fitted powers. The 120-word orientation anchor is met cleanly with geodesic dome, pre-dawn time, and fungal light. Persistent constraint: once she sees the selective opening, her former fortress logic is foreclosed; the final image carries that price without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent dome functions as both environment and tool: its pulsing light literally enables the laser demonstration that reweights Maren’s inner architecture. Spatial choreography is flawless—rows, laser track, spore drift, skin contact—each stage tracked without floating bodies. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s intrusion-trained attention: she notices thresholds, frequencies, micro-expressions first; smell or temperature arrive only when stakes soften. The mushroom farm is not a postcard but a pressure chamber that forces her final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she exchange detection for release?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened exactly once: when she whispers “Show me again,” trading her prior identity for permeability. The escalation is accumulative: each laser sweep increases spore density and emotional risk under the dome’s contained pressure. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal–external fusion—her own perceptual grid versus the living membrane. Cost is visible: spores coat her skin, the morning enters, and her fortress episteme is irreversibly breached.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the biological metaphor: selective permeability as an alternative to defensive collapse. Subtext resides in gesture—Yua’s first spoken line (“You look like someone who needs to see something impossible”) and the silent second sweep of the laser. No character moralizes; the final image reweights the premise without sermon. The story invites counter-readings: is permeability brave or simply another controlled experiment?—ambiguity that lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—architectural rotations, micro-expression triage, spore trajectories. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“a slow-motion wildfire made of light”) then fractures into breathless imperative (“Show me again”), mirroring her loosening grid. No head-hop; Yua’s dialogue is filtered through Maren’s intrusion ear, hearing only what matters to thresholds. The voice is distinct, consistent, and modulated by pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long fungal cadences yield to staccato laser clicks; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—only two metaphors (“wildfire,” “shrapnel”)—both earned and non-contradictory. Information density is high: backstory marriage, occupation, and emotional wound compressed into 90 words without stall. Line-level artifacts are absent; even the scientific exposition is woven through action and observation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The intrusion-detection specialist seeking a physics of “letting go” via fungal membrane science is a fresh synthesis; no trope checklist feel. The bioluminescent farm replaces the expected therapy office or mountain retreat, making the metaphor materially consequential. Risk is taken in quiet lyric escalation rather than plot twist, and the gamble pays off in the final charged poise. Transformation test fails if swapped: only a spatially gifted intrusion analyst would perceive the dome as architecture breathing open.</comment>
