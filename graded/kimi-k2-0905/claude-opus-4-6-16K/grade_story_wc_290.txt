<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s claustrophobia and “quiet defiance” stay embodied (step-counting, chest seizing); the compass-point micro-choices visibly tether her fear to forward motion. The final ascent keeps the flaw active—walls still press, she still counts—so endurance carries cost rather than cure. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, but the absence of a live second character limits relationship crucible leverage. Closure choice (claim key while still afraid) is earned by prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear: claustrophobia → tunnel shift → compass resonance → organ stabilizes → key retrieved. Spatial-mutiny rules are taught on first encounter and obeyed thereafter; organ counterpoint is foreshadowed by wind-through-ruin cue. Closure delivers Decisive Change with felt cost—panic remains, ascent still hurts—so price is on-page. One transition (surface-to-tunnel) is clean; orientation anchors within first 120 words; no prop or rule breaks detected.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dust, collapsed nave, lantern reach, and vibrating steel pin the locale without tourist clutter. Environment directly constrains tactics: narrowing stone triggers panic; organ resonance literally freezes architecture, enabling progress. Starlight shaft at climax functions as both setting and symbol, charging final image. Micro-setting (compass point as tactile map) meets 9+ gate by shaping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve key or be crushed by living tunnel—is signaled early and tightened when walls begin slow-motion collapse. Escalation is single but meaningful: spatial mutiny narrows options to “find harmonic or die.” Protagonist agency drives turn—she experiments with compass against wall, then sprints along resonant path. Cost is visceral (panic, oxygen-thin breath) and persists into closure, satisfying 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “wistful rebellion against self-imposed limits” emerges through embodied particulars rather than statement. Final image—wind’s hymn sounding ‘like gratitude’—offers resonant reweighting of fear-as-gateway rather than fear-as-enemy. No moralizing sentence intrudes; ambiguity remains (she’s still claustrophobic). Missing a second layer of social stakes keeps it just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“geological patience,” “arithmetic of fear”) is hers, not authorial. Syntax lengthens under stress then fractures into shorter clauses during collapse, mirroring breath. Free-indirect texture is consistent; no filter-verb bloat. Voice distinction not tested against dialogue since none appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (action + sensory metaphor) without purple drift. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors detected. Opening and closing lines are image-driven and propulsive. Rhythm modulates: languid ascent description yields to staccato panic beats. Only nit: “geological patience” risks slight writerliness, but it aligns with cartographer mindset and occurs outside peak beat, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines claustrophobic cartographer, living architecture, and Aeolian organ into a synthesis that feels fresh yet inevitable. Spatial-mutiny defense keyed by accidental hymn reframes familiar “moving maze” trope through sonic counter-logic. Specificity—blueprint compass point as tuning fork—prevents generic swap-out. Risk taken with organ-as-ex-machina is foreshadowed and earned, meriting the high band.</comment>
