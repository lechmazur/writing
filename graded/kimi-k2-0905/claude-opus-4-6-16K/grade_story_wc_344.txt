<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s want is clear and personally rooted; the embodied nostalgia lands. Yet her interiority borders on label-speak (“she understood now”) and the decisive gear-turn lacks a contradictory impulse on the page, so the final choice feels more observed than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: climb → find scraps → uncap oil → gears breathe. The Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4; closure is a Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the library begins to thaw because conversation is restored—though the cost to Elara herself is only implied, not felt on her body or future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Frozen library is no postcard: frost under boots, cloud-pine resin scent, pages darkening as brass sings. The “hauntingly bright” sun and salt-drift spines are selective, POV-filtered, and the micro-setting of the escape wheel in her palm constrains the final fix; environment materially guides the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the escape wheel catches its reflection and the whole assortment self-turns, foreclosing the option to keep tinkering; pressure resolves into earned stasis. Price is conceptual (lost era thawing) rather than personal or tactile, keeping the beat just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “repair as restored conversation” emerges via image, not lecture: gears talking, library warming, pages softening. The final re-pricing—memory made live through reciprocal motion—lands without moralizing, though the emotional after-effect is gentle rather than vertiginous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is cool, crystalline, tactile. Syntax modulates with longer reflective sentences then short percussive clauses when gears engage; no register drift or filter-verb clutter. Voice feels singular and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—action, atmosphere, emotion—without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (salt-drift spines, breathing gears); rhythm accelerates at the gear-turn climax then exhales. One paraphrase loop (“the gears began to turn… the gears kept turning”) is minor; no mixed vehicles or overwriting in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith, sky-ladder library, and “hall-of-mirrors” clockwork braid into a fresh conceptual snapshot. Tropes (frozen archive, bereaved artisan) are re-animated through sensory specificity and self-reflecting mechanism. While the emotional arc is familiar, the mechanical metaphor for inter-generational conversation feels non-obvious and integral.</comment>
