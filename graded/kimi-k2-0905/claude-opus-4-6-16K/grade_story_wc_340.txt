<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s curiosity-driven ascent and the micro-choice to peer through the goggles are cleanly motivated; the diary’s emotional payload lands because her prior warmth is shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“her breath caught,” “wiped her eyes”) and the final endurance of carrying Halse’s secret carries visible cost. The only minor slack: the “locked room / window” metaphor is repeated without fresh embodiment at the climax, muting the internal contradiction a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Maren steps into amber light knowing she is “chosen” to bear witness; the cost is the irreversible knowledge of being loved from afar. Causality is airtight—goggles → light → legible grief → reconfigured identity. The elevator-as-clock structure tightens naturally; no orientation drift. One causal pearl: the diary could only be read by the one servant willing to climb, a constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice-spire is never described for tourist wonder; every crystalline refraction is routed through Maren’s attention and literally enables the decryption beat. The amber tint of the goggles re-colors both light and emotional temperature, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—floor numbers, cable song, cloud ceiling—so the setting functions as a vertical crucible that forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will let herself feel the old man’s love—tightens once: the moment she reads her own name, retreat becomes impossible. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each floor refracts new grief-lines, density increases, no reversals needed. The cost is the unbearable intimacy of being seen; it is felt on-page (“tucked the diary… close against her ribs”). No escalation missteps; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the possibility that anonymous labor can be a covert form of love. Subtext lives in the goggles—an object from the beloved past becomes the lens that recognizes the present beloved. No thematic statement is declared; the final image of amber clouds reweights every prior scrubbed floor without moralizing. Only a hair below 9 because the Ulla thread is named but not dramatized, leaving a wisp of abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Maren’s perceptual sieve: she counts floors by “changing quality of light,” hears cables “sing”—a distinct auditory signature. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short beats at the climax, mirroring breath. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within her lexicon. The diary excerpts shift register slightly—older, more formal—without breaking focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances either elevator motion or emotional decryption. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. The single repeated “locked room” image is the only micro-blemish, and it never metastasizes into clutter. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with floor numbers, then exhales into the final white expanse—precise control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary / amber-goggles dyad feels fresh because it literalizes the act of being “seen through” another’s grief. The ice-spire servant frame could have tipped into steampunk pastiche, but keeps its charge by staying inside Maren’s unprivileged POV. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric uplift rather than subversive twist—but the synthesis is specific enough to resist swap-out. No derivative-premise penalty warranted.</comment>
