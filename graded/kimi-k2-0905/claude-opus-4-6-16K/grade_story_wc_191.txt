<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Senna’s “wisely adventurous” label is shown only once (three escape routes) and never retested; the final sit-down on the throne is unmotivated—no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized, so the choice feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: archive → orchard → paint-peel → ruby → stair → throne; sunrise deadline tightens options; closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (world-network wakes). One causal gap: why the throne “does not want you” warning is ignored without internal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall, chrome-bark data-trees, and paint-layer palimpsest are vivid, selective, and filtered through Senna’s cataloguing gaze; the ruby’s refractive song charging the final image lifts it above postcard scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the throne before dawn—is signaled early and tightens through peeling paint, ruby trial, and ascending stairs; sunrise curtain supplies tangible price. Escalation is linear rather than reversed, so pressure intensifies but never truly threatens failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheriting abandoned power emerges through image-pattern of living archives—trees, paint, throne—without overt statement; final “give them something worth hearing” reweights premise toward responsibility, not conquest, avoiding moral lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—cataloguer’s precision, reverent diction, measured cadence; no head-hop or register drift. Syntax flexes under pressure: clipped clauses on stairs, luminous elongation at throne.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold; only minor loop: “paint” repeated 5× in 40 words mid-peel. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands clean, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse data-orchard and throne-of-network are fresh syntheses; paint-stratified murals as living archive is lovely turn. Concept risks familiar “seeker claims dormant super-tech” arc, but chrome-bark nodes and prismatic firewall add specific inflection.</comment>
