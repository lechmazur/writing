<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s “carefully resourceful” tag is shown, not told: she alone trusts the puddle-map, archives a second set of prints, schedules staggered re-uploads. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the familiar vertigo”), stakes scale to her skin, and the final dip of her hand in the lagoon is a micro-choice that costs her rest but keeps the line. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9-band gate just misses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the backup set is secured and the histories will “reappear,” reweighting the Ministry’s erasure. Causal chain—puddle reflection → alley → key → archive → starlight upload—locks step-by-step with no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the cracked-skylight grind of the photo session and the after-image of “ancient, unrevised light” she releases. Lens holds as Causal; one tightening beat suffices at 780 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lagoon’s gold, copper-silt smell, and star-doubled surface act as both map and mirror, guiding her route and charging the final image. The AuraLink door’s dust and the linden stumps ground the “non-existent” alley in tactile contradiction. Weather and environment constrain choice: dusk timing makes the puddles legible; starlight alone lets her photograph. No slack descriptive tourism; every detail tilts the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve truth against erasure—tightens once when Dahl radios “Warehouse Four is gone,” forcing the night walk to the “non-existent” exchange. Agency is all Maren: she decides to go, picks the lock, shoots the photos, schedules the reappear spell. Cost is visible—hours, risk of capture, the quiet foreclosing of sleep—and shapes the final image of her hand releasing gold ripples. One meaningful turn meets the short-form bar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of reflection: water remembers what bureaucracy dissolves. The ending’s ripple reweights every prior mirror-image, making “coded freedom” felt without moralizing. Subtext in the worn key and sawn linden stumps whispers that partial erasures still leave roots. Ambiguity lingers—tomorrow’s reader may fail—yet the stance is clear: persistence is its own moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Maren’s technician eye: “encrypted the files,” “scheduled them to reappear,” diction exact but never academic. Rhythm swells from long lagoon sentences to staccato radio shards, mirroring pressure. No head-hop; perception filter stays tight (“she allowed herself to feel something close to freedom”). Dialogue fragment from Dahl is clipped, contrastive, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, body, or memory. Mixed metaphors (“gold even after the sun dropped”) are taught immediately as lagoon magic and remain consistent. High information density: “shelves. Dusty, undisturbed, and full” delivers four story beats in five words. Closure line “The line held” is spare, cadence-earned, unadorned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: liquid palimpsest as GPS, defunct telecom hardware as lock-pick, administrative amnesia as antagonist. Risk of bureaucratic indifference over spectacle violence feels novel yet inevitable. Puddle-map device is specific to this world; swap it and the plot collapses. The final ripple reprises the opening gold, turning lyrical device into tactical victory.</comment>
