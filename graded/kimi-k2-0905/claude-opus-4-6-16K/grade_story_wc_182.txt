<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s linguist skills matter, but her interiority is mostly summary; we see competence yet no live contradiction or embodied cost. The rescue decision is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices. Traits stay labels (“carefully resourceful”) until late; we don’t feel trade-offs until the mountain opens. Earned stasis is asserted, not pressed through flesh.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure is present as Charged Poise: mountain sings, lessons await, cost hinted. Yet causality is thin—Maren’s arrival and the diary’s code drop as coincidence, not driven by Elara’s prior failures. The “speak to stone” pivot is externally gifted; she doesn’t earn the linguistic key through earlier mapping grief. Orientation drifts: we never anchor day/month or spatial zero, weakening before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is evocative—shelves as geology, corridors that breathe. Sensory range is narrow but selective, focusing on stone resonance and paper hush, mirroring Elara’s mindset. Micro-setting works: the diary pages as acoustic map tie tool to terrain and final tactic. Spatial choreography stays clean; each opened wall is a visible, tactile reward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stake—reach the Library—announced early, yet pressure stays declarative. Escalation is delivered through discovered lore rather than mounting obstacle; the mountain simply yields once phonetics are tried. No visible cost accrues to Elara: oil, thread, time left unspent. The final opening feels like a gift, not a forced trade-off under tightening constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten wisdom vs. listening emerges through imagery, not lecture. The mountain-as-instrument motif reweights the premise at closure, offering conceptual repricing. Subtext could go deeper—no direct dramatized example of an “unlearned lesson” is faced, so idea hovers abstract. Still, resonance lands quietly via the unheard symphony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice is controlled, syntactically varied, with pleasing density. Late-Meridian phonetics keep diction within Elara’s ken, reinforcing POV. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor disciplined. Dialogue is sparse but natural, though Maren’s voice merges with Elara’s in diction—not enough to sap distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean; rhythm modulates, sentences carry dual duty. Occasional scaffold—“corridors carved… that believed knowledge was geology”—but imagery coherent. No mixed metaphors or loops in final third. Could trim “books that hummed” repetition; small filler keeps it from high-density excellence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantastical library-mountain and acoustic-navigation code feel fresh, not derivative. Conceptual risk—treating knowledge as strata—pays off in closure image. Scholars surviving on annotated moss is specific, memorable. Could push further into lived consequence of unlearned lessons to avoid purely metaphoric payoff.</comment>
