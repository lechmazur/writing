<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—needing raw edges yet craving control—animates every beat; the moment she writes Callum’s name in full is credibly earned by the mapped memories and bellows micro-choice. Embodied emotion stays concrete: trembling hand, taped leather flexing, rain smell. The final sentence’s stone-in-water image crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor slip: “therapy-speak” glint in “I was there and I failed…” still feels diagnostic, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the journal entry reweights all prior mapping as confession, with the stone metaphor carrying felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy density, bellows patch, graffiti reprise tighten the stake without causal reversals. Orientation anchors by word 40; no teleporting props. One hairline wobble: creek-as-forgiveness idea is introduced late, not taught early, but it is rejected, not exploited, so lens stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greyhollow Station is lived-in: ticket counter stones echo riverbed, ivy limits movement, mirror graffiti supplies the crucial cue. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—rust smells alive after medication cessation. Micro-setting (bellows) constrains the final micro-choice. Only missing 9+ gate: environment does not physically alter her final path—she simply walks away—so final image not charged by external constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth-telling vs. self-anaesthetizing—tightens once: decision to write Callum’s name forecloses denial. Under Accumulative lens, density of red-ink confessions on maps escalates cost of disclosure. No external antagonist; coincidence absent. Price is legible: she trades numbness for exposed grief, witnessed by rain and bellows seam.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—reckoning versus cartographic control—emerges through pattern: every mapped bend now reframed as evasion. Final stone-in-water image offers non-literal answer: truth is erosion, not absolution. No moralizing; creek’s indifference undercuts earlier graffiti “wisdom.” Subtext in bellows patch whispers repair-without-innocence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature skews to hydrology metaphors and color weight, consistent with river chronicler. Syntax mirrors pressure—long sentences for accretion, fragment at “here” for impact. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose shows rhythmic variety, high density: “Colors carried weight again” compresses synesthesia and stakes. No loops, no scaffold. One metaphor stack mid-climax—“present, solid, slowly wearing smooth”—remains coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“reckoning beneath it”) slightly overshoots POV lexicon but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: watershed cartography as grief archaeology. Bellows-taped patch repurposed metaphor for functional brokenness avoids cliché. Familiar ruin-exploration frame is reanimated via withdrawal-from-medication perceptual twist. Risk is moderate; no structural experimentation, but conceptual repricing lands.</comment>
