<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and specific—fever-glow, shell-weight, notebook fragments—yet the ‘charmed skeptic’ stance is asserted more than enacted; no beat shows her testing then half-believing. The final notebook entry is a credible micro-choice that pays for earlier stasis, giving visible cost and earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shell half settles against her hip “like a small, familiar weight,” reweighting the premise—she will archive absence into architecture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: night-long listening → dawn notebook → forward stride, each beat thickening the pattern without causal reversals. Cost is legible in the “incomplete, distorted” pages she accepts; no Orientation debt; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden’s velvet petals, stone bench, fountain, and spiraled shell supply tactile micro-setting that constrains the only action—sit, listen, write—while dusk→dawn shift marks the emotional arc. Selective sensory triage (purple swallowing light, shell-chambers shaping air) keeps description lean yet atmospheric; spatial choreography stays clean in a single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reconstruct Clara without recovering her”—is clear early; meaningful tightening occurs when night’s failed echoes force acceptance of “incomplete, distorted” copies, foreclosing perfect retrieval. Escalation is textural (darkening→stars→dawn) rather than causal, fitting the chosen lens; price is felt in notebook fragments she knowingly mislabels real.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: archiving as devotional act of building from wreckage. No moralizing; final image of walking into a morning “she had made her own” reconfigures isolation into authorship without stating thesis. Subtextual irony—she preserves Clara by admitting she can’t—adds complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains a consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic color-eating petals, logarithmic spiral as dollhouse rooms, ocean-as-resonance metaphor. Syntax lengthens under contemplation then shortens at closure (“She closed the notebook. She tucked…”) mirroring resolve. No head-hopping; diction stays within literary-archivist lexicon; patterned repetition is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (information + image); no filter-verb stacks, loops, or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“wreckage could be architecture”) is minor; clarity never blurs. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-quarantine via infection-scarred brain wall is fresh; using half-shell resonance as archival method marries science-poetry to grief-work. Concept stays specific to this narrator; transformation test passes—swap shell or garden and the emotional math collapses.</comment>
