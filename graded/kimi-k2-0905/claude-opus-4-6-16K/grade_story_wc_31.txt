<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oren’s solitary ritual, tactile key-tag, and final underwater listening beat are concrete; interiority stays embodied (“cold biting through wool”). The promise-as-frequency realization lands as earned renunciation—he forecloses return to Room 7 and accepts perpetual search. No contradictory impulses on-page until the quiet final moment, so the 9+ bar for simultaneous interior clash isn’t quite met, but cost is visible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each amber lamp, the rising lanterns, and the hull’s color-bloom tighten the same stake—perceiving her voice. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the brass tag becomes a frequency carrier, not a key, costing him the fantasy of eventual arrival. Causality is internal but coherent; pattern taught early (“luminous vows”) and paid off in the final amber-blue image. Orientation, transitions, and cost are clean; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor tide, lantern-lit sky, and the iron resonance chamber are filtered through Oren’s attuned ear-eye; the curved hull literally refracts sound into color, constraining his final perception. Micro-setting (the key tag against his chest) charges the closing image. Selective sensory hierarchy—knocks=violet, gulls=white-green—keeps texture purposeful. Environment shapes both tactic (wading out at lowest tide) and revelation; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hear her golden voice—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each lamp, then hundreds of lanterns, then the hull’s collective murmur compress the same desire into visible amber. The tightening forces the final reframing: relinquish the key’s literal return and keep its frequency. Cost is the eternal search; agency lies in the whispered renunciation “Golden.” One meaningful intensification satisfies short-form bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of promises as living light emerges from iterated amber images and the final color-shift, never abstractly lectured. Subtext in the crowd’s hush vs. his solitary dive dramatizes communion vs. isolation. The closing image reweights “luminous vows” from nostalgic token to perpetual obligation without moralizing. Complexity intact: he gains certainty yet loses rest, a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Oren’s synesthetic ear-eye; perceptual signature is consistent (“deck just breaking the surface”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for ritual, clipped fragments underwater. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Pattern-taught elision (“wandering purposefully”) is paid off when the seemingly aimless route reveals its true acoustic target. Distinct, controlled, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without overcrowding (“water to his chest, cold biting through wool, and found the hatch”). Figurative language is sparse until the climax, then blooms in controlled color bursts. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; pronouns, tense, and spatial tracking flawless. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the hull then exhales on the final lamp route. Clean at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sunken-ship library as resonance chamber for synesthetic grief is fresh; combines maritime decay, sound-art installation, and elegy without gimmickry. The brass tag transmuted into acoustic frequency offers a non-obvious metaphor for enduring commitment. Risky lyric escalation pays off: color literally emerges from sound, fulfilling the prompt’s impossible premise. Specificity makes the fusion inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
