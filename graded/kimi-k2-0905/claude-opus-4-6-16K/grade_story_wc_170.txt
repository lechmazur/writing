<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The painter’s interiority is vivid—her calm erosion of heartbeat feels embodied, not declared. Lisha is sketched too lightly to exert real relationship pressure, so the “apprenticeship” beat lands as symbol more than crucible. The final micro-choice—teaching the river song—does trace back to the mirrored mirage and narrows the silence between beats, so the arc earns its quiet reversal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lullaby adds density until the self-portrait mirage reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—terrace, bells, rain-caught light all inside 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the widened silence narrows, cost visible in “the rest resolving into the note.” One transition (night-to-spring coda) is legible and brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism parapet is handled twice—once as optical tool that catches rain-spectra, once as the literal seat where the painter teaches Lisha, constraining the final tableau. Echo architecture doubles sound and memory, mirroring the story’s thematic doubleness. Spatial anchors hold across the single continuous terrace scene; weather evolves from post-downpour to dusk without contradiction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the painter keep giving heartbeats without vanishing? Pressure tightens when the self-mirage offers a distributive future; the widening inter-beat silence is the visible price. No antagonist is needed—the cost itself escalates under the Accumulative lens. Final cadence shift (silence “narrowed, just slightly”) legibly forecloses continuation of pure self-sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of mirroring, borrowing, and repayment: visions as permissions, not promises. Final reprise of river-sky color exchange reweights earlier heartbeat-loan logic without moralizing. Subtext in shared lullabies encodes communal survival of cost. Ambiguity remains—future students may still pay, but the possibility of diluted burden is now undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a consistent middle distance, filtering perception through the painter’s bodily quiet. Syntax elongates then contracts to mimic breath and heartbeat rests. No dialogue slips into exposition; the single spoken cue (“river that borrowed the sky’s color”) carries subtextual instruction. Patterned repetition of “borrowed heartbeat” is taught early and pays off in the narrowed rest.</comment>

<comment>Prose density is high—rainwater trembles into faces, mirrors repay light, silence widens—yet every image advances atmosphere or stake. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; cadence modulates with breath. Minor scaffold: “terrace wrapped...like a stone ribbon” is familiar, but it occurs early and does not recur. Closing sentence resolves on sonic image without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mirage-painting via lullaby-frequency is fresh, and tying the cost to literal arrhythmia converts metaphor to physiological price. The inversion—mirror forced to show future instead of past—reconfigures a familiar trope. Specificity of belltower echo prism and encoded local lullabies grounds the concept in Vellara-only detail. Risk in lyrical accretion pays off; closure remains legible.</comment>
