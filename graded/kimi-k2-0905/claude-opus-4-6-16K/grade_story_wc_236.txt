<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—intuitive healer now denied intuition—lands early and threads every beat; the brass screw choice is a visible micro-act that crystallizes the trade-off. Emotion stays embodied (the screw “warm from resting against her hip”), never drifting into label-speak. The ending’s Earned Stasis feels proportionate: she forecloses the old scent-driven life with the calm irrevocability of water finding its level. The only drag is a slight over-calibration of competence—she never mis-threads or doubts the repair, so struggle feels curated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the steady drip re-weights the premise—attention as a sense—and the cost is the irreversibility of smell-loss, legible in the sternum-beat. Causal chain holds: because smell vanished, therefore she seeks slow systems; because the screw fits, therefore the clepsydra lives and redefines time for her. Orientation anchors inside 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Micro-turn (the screw’s first catch then smooth turn) tightens stakes exactly once, sufficient for 700-word window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shop is rendered as a body of dripping veins—copper, glass, gravity—so the setting doubles as tool and anatomy; the midwife screw is micro-setting that literally seats the flow. Fog and dawn屈指可数的细节（“frosted glass softens a landscape”) echo the occluded-perception concept without overt signposting. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bench, tap, reservoir, sternum form a single vertical line. No environmental choice is blocked or altered, so 9+ gate not quite met, but the screw-valve constraint charges the final image strongly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can attention replace lost perception?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepened once: the screw either validates or buries the old identity. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal: each drip adds density until the chest-lock “yields.” The visible price is the permanent forfeit of olfactory mastery; tactics (sniffing roses) are shown and abandoned on-page. No external antagonist needed; the tension is stance-vs-time, and it crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated particulars: birthing clamp → life entry; clepsydra → time measurement; their union = ordinary miracle. No character sermonizes; the final logbook line is a concrete record, not a moral. The reader is left to feel that attention itself is a form of synesthesia—time tasted in drops—an insight earned rather than declared. Ambiguity is productive: the screw once ushered life, now measures its passage; no tidy axiom is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual biases: she clocks the world through temperature, thread count, drip rhythm. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress (“the first drop… like a fingertip tapping glass”). Diction is precise yet humble—no academic register drift. The only minor slip is one near-abstraction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing in “ordinary miracles”) but it is embedded in concrete context and doesn’t rupture voice.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentence for fog, staccato for drops. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; “water perpetually measuring itself against gravity” is fresh yet accurate. One paraphrase loop (“she’d been gifted… intuitive… the kind of practitioner…”) is a soft scaffold but occurs early and doesn’t recur. Final third is clean; closure beat is unmarred. Information density high—every sentence at least dual-tasking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The olfactory-loss clockmaker is itself a non-obvious synthesis; coupling it with a birthing screw that becomes a time-valve feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh in conception. Risk is taken with quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic turn, and it pays off in Charged Poise. No trope is borrowed wholesale; “ordinary miracle” could have slid into pseudo-profundity but is grounded in brass and water. Specificity of estate-sale find vs. Egyptian replica adds authenticating detail.</comment>
