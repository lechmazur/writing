<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—crown-hatred yet dream-obedience—drives every step; her quiet authority trait is embodied in the climb, not labeled. The final renunciation costs her the only symbol of worldly power she still possessed, and the shared recognition with the girl crystallizes a new hierarchy of values on the page. No stock phrasing; every beat advances motive or pressure. Micro-choices (kneeling, removing crown, inviting the girl) all spring from the established trait set. Meets the 9+ quick test except the cost is legible but not yet painful; still, the path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the stars bled, therefore she climbs; because she reaches the pool, therefore she hears the sentence that redefines her vocation; because she meets the other dreamer, therefore she abandons the crown. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the crown left on stone—so the reader sees the before/after threshold. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or convenient knowledge. One meaningful tightening: the pool vision collapses seven years of dream into a single imperative that forecloses kingship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cobalt and ember grottos are not backdrop; their bleeding starlight literally rewrites her vocation and provides the only mirror that speaks. The mountain’s altitude kills fireflies, yet they survive—this impossible detail charges the final image and constrains belief. Every sensory detail (condensation-slick rock, shared breath-cloud, lace-fine starlight) is filtered through her bodily struggle and symbolic read. Environment + body + crown-as-tool together force the final choice; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether she will keep ruling or yield to the dream—tightens once: the vision’s sentence “You were meant to rule the threshold” eliminates both the crown and the palace in one beat. The price is the crown itself, abandoned on stone; the option retreat is foreclosed. Pressure is coherent causal escalation under the bleeding-sky constraint; no coincidence resolves anything. One visible loss alters later tactics: relinquishing sovereignty symbolically ends her royal agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of sovereignty and liminality: power lies not over people but over the passage itself. Subtext operates in the shared exhale and the fireflies that should not live—threshold creatures mirroring the girls’ impossible survival. No moral is stated; the final image of two dreamers walking into “the bleeding sky above” reweights every prior crown-image without sermon. Ambiguity remains: what “ruling the threshold” entails is left charged but unanswered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside the queen’s perceptual signature—stars “look wounded,” starlight “resembles lace that could cut.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with altitude fatigue, then shortens at the crown removal. No head-hopping; the girl’s interior is unknowable, shown only through shared breath and wide eyes. Distinct diction (“softly commanding,” “hemorrhage of light”) is sustained without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: advance action, deepen metaphor, and maintain altitude breathlessness. No loops or synonym churn; each image is unique. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“bleeding starlight” taught in paragraph 1) and paid off at closure. One mixed-metaphor risk—“lace that could cut”—reads as intentional paradox rather than muddle. Final-line propulsion is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic horror and quiet abdication feels non-obvious: the apocalypse is not conquest but vocation. Bleeding starlight, cobalt grotto, and crown renunciation are specific to this world; swap any element and the arc collapses. Risk—renouncing kingship in a single beat—pays off because the pool vision earns it. No close echoes; the throne-rejection trope is inverted into threshold-guardianship rather than freedom.</comment>
