<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—the promise of amends versus the daily, solitary ritual—are dramatized in the kneeling, seed-crushing, and bird-listening beats; the final “faith that… a battlefield become a garden” crystallizes renunciation with cost (no passengers, no reef, no certainty). Interiority stays rooted in concrete sensory acts; no label-speak. Micro-choices (selecting three pods, listening to the whimbrel) reveal value hierarchy. Closure choice earns stasis under prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of daily ritual + seed scattering + bird augury tightens toward the charged poise of leaving the garden unfinished. Closure image (“the coach rattling… leaving behind… stubborn bloom”) reweights the stake from reef-loss to ongoing reclamation with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; setting anchors by line 5. Persistent constraint (empty coach, dead reef) shapes every tactical move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Jetty crevices, tidal spray, rusted cleats, and bird calls constrain where seeds can root; the “narrow vastness” phrase recharges in the final image. Micro-setting (satchel, milkweed dust, fish-meal pinch) alters tactics beat-by-beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren’s horticultural ear-eye priority. Weather forecast via whimbrel directly shapes next action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep the submerged concord alive despite absent reef and passengers. Escalation is textural—each evening’s ritual deepens the obligation and narrows his life to the jetty. Final tightening: rain tomorrow will test the new seeds, crystallizing endurance with felt cost. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accretion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation emerges through seed, language, and battlefield memory; no morals stated. Subtext in bird-call translation and dead-language whispering implies healing across erasures. Final image reconfigures meaning: the empty coach departs but the garden remains—resonant, non-literal answer to “what comes after destruction.” Ambiguity (reef may never return) lingers with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Maren’s perceptual filter—botanical precision, avian phonetics, archaeological grief. Syntax modulates: longer rhythmic clauses for ritual, crisp fragment (“Rain tomorrow. Good.”) for bird translation. No head-hop; diction stays within ex-linguist lexicon without academic drift. Compression (“He had been a different man…”) is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse action, memory, and sensory texture (“crushed them gently… releasing seeds fine as dust”). Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Mixed metaphors absent; “arterial red” is controlled. One paraphrase loop minor (“the road served no purpose… no passengers had ridden”) but does not touch closure. Clean grammar and prop tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-ecocide horturgical liturgy via Akkadian-laced seed ritual. Battlefield-to-garden vow reframed through coastal botany and avian meteorology. Risk of quiet ending justified by charged poise. Specificity (whimbrel seven-note forecast, kelp-ash fertilizer) prevents template drift. Not 9+ only because reef-garden analogy nods to familiar trope—elevated by linguistic and ornithological inflections.</comment>
