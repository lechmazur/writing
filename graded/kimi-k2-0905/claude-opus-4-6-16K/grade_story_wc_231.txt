<comment>Maren’s quietly stubborn curator-of-fragments identity is consistent; her final refusal to relinquish the boutonniere crystallizes an earned endurance. Yet her internal contradiction—collecting others’ memories while denying her own loneliness—stays summary; we never feel it twist under pressure in-scene. The “borrowed memories” insight arrives as declared epiphany rather than dramatized collision of impulses, muting cost. Still, the pinned flower at the end makes her micro-choice legible and irreversible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s keeping the Edelweiss reweights her hoarder-stance into caretaker-custodian, cost visible in the image of the “small white star against dark wool.” Causal chain holds: logbook → Alpine man → boutonniere → Maren’s recognition of kinship → decision to hold. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Slight frictions: tickets/shoes deductions summarized not enacted, but these support rather than resolve pressure, so lens stays intact.</comment>

<comment>Opal dock’s iridescent planking, salt-slick mist, and lighthouse beam serve as both stage and mirror—constraining movement and refracting Maren’s attention. Sensory triangulation (visual gleam, olfactory ghost of Edelweiss, haptic sodden wool) is selective, never tourist. Final image of lantern light “touching mist without conquering” externalizes her Charged Poise, charging locale with conceptual cost. Micro-setting (wet wool scrap) literally triggers the entire inquiry, satisfying 9+ constraint.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the stranger’s final gesture”—is declared early; pressure tightens when logbook sketch proves the memento predates her tenure, collapsing temporal distance. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of “borrowed memories” motif grows from buttons/old charts → Alpine relic → self-recognition. One meaningful turn: shift from objective curiosity to custodial responsibility; cost is forfeiture of her habitual detachment. Could use slightly sharper visceral price (fatigue, risk), but on-page trade-off is legible.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: custodianship as antidote to erasure—someone must stand witness and refuse the sea’s appetite. Subtext resides in gestures (pinned flower) and spatial tensions (keeper vs. tide) rather than exposition. Ambiguity is productive: we never learn Lise’s story, only the imperative that her name be carried forward. No moralizing summation; final line’s “hers” quietly privatizes the communal grief, reconfiguring meaning without statement.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains Maren’s marine-cataloguer perceptual signature: she reads silence, notes condensation, catalogs absences. Syntax modulates between long tide-swept clauses and abrupt fragments that mimic surf slap. No POV slippage; diction stays within her weather-beaten lexicon (“bruised light,” “salt-swollen spine”). Dialogue absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on narrative texture—successfully. Occasional lyric elevation (“ghostly light”) is licensed by her nightly vigil, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense: each sentence either advances mystery or deepens atmosphere. Figurative layer (mist/finger, star/flower) is selective, never congesting high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; only micro-repeat is intentional (“borrowed memories” refrain). Opening and closing images bracket narrative cleanly. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” risk—but sentence-level clarity never falters, keeping closure image pristine.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses maritime gothic with Alpine after-echo, avoiding clichéd castaway tropes. Focus on memento-as-missive refreshes the found-object device by making it a relay baton across decades. Risk of sentimentality averted via Maren’s refusal to release the flower: keeper ethic overrides catharsix. Not radically avant-garde, but synthesis and stance feel specific to this voice; transformation test passes—story collapses without Edelweiss/logbook convergence.</comment>
