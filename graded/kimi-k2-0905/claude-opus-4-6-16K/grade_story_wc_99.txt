<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sable’s grief-rooted stillness is embodied in every micro-gesture; the junior-green apology arrives as earned perceptual shift, not label. The severance calcifies behind her sternum and is visibly loosened by the compass-lace convergence, so renunciation carries cost. Interior contradiction pulses—“slow-spoken” vs. the thirty-year silence—yet the pacing keeps it credibly taut. Only the off-stage daughter prevents full relationship-as-crucible pressure, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the letter, compass, and new color crystallize options with undeniable emotional cost. Causality holds: lace motif → compass alignment → memory surge → writable apology; each because/therefore link tightens the internal stakes. The 120-word anchor clears who/where/when; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the compass’s tidal arc—shapes the final tactic of writing tomorrow, satisfying 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-rain islet air, wet grass, and antique lace under bonsai tools are filtered through Sable’s tactile priorities; every detail either constrains pruning angles or mirrors internal tide. The ghost-ship compass functions as micro-setting that physically re-orients action on the cloth. Spatial choreography is clean: doorway → garden → shelf → letter. Environment directly supplies the final image—compass as paperweight—charging closure; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she locate and speak the apology—tightens once the compass locks onto lace: knowledge gained narrows option from mute regret to writable words. Pressure is internal, coherent, and escalates under causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Visible price: she lays down shears—symbolic surrender of old control—and commits to mainland journey. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; could use slightly sharper cost articulation to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: transmission of matrilineal knowledge, tardy restitution, and the color of remorse refracted through horticultural light. Subtext lives in gesture—dropping shears, fingertip on lace—never sermon. Final image of compass pinning the unsent letter reweights “cerulean regret” into green growth without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will ferry ride succeed—yet resonance is charged; only minor tidy phrasing (“apology spoken late is still a living thing”) nudges score below 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Sable’s tidal patience; perceptual signature is slow, oceanic, needle-attentive. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her restraint, then shortens at the discovery beat. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Free indirect style cleanly fuses interior hue-shift: “It was not cerulean after all…” Distinctive diction sustains across beats; meets 9+ control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet propulsive: “clean, bruised quality” does double sensory duty; lace eyelets equal seasons; no filler. Figurative logic stays coherent—tidal heartbeat, calcified cerulean—without mixed-metaphor slippage. One minor paraphrase loop (“slow, deliberate patience… rushing only deepened wounds”) could trim, but it does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates naturally; high information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combining antique lace embroidery with bonsai arboriculture feels fresh and specific; ghost-ship compass that obeys tides rather than magnetism intensifies the peculiarity. Emotional core—mother seeking color of thirty-year silence—is timeless yet rendered through these singular artifacts. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic heirlooms. Risk is present but serves coherence; not merely quirky ornament.</comment>
