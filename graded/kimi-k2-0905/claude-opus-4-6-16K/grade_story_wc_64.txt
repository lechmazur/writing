<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s quiet, death-versed interiority is vivid and consistent; her refusal to chase treasure or revenge but only “the shape of intentions” is a fresh, specific hierarchy of values. The micro-choice to fold the tapestry and climb out into the night crystallizes her stance with visible cost—she now carries the dead man’s burden. No contradiction or label-speak; blitheness reads as earned proximity, not shorthand. Just shy of 9 because we never feel her body under stress—no tremor, fatigue, or sensory warp—so the cost stays cerebral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coordinates and date reweight every prior thread; the gardener’s future path is foreclosed—she must now dig under the eastern wall. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each decoded knot tightens the pattern until the final name reframes the graves. Orientation is taught by 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image—“she was a gardener. She knew that some seeds take forty years to bloom”—intention becomes her responsibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo’s chemical stain and starlit throat are not backdrop but crucible: the open hatch funnels starlight onto the board, making decoding physically possible. The tapestry fragment itself acts as micro-setting—its frayed border literally guides finger and eye. Spatial choreography is clean; she climbs in, pins cloth to corkboard, folds, climbs out. Environment constrains the final choice—only the silo feels “outside of time,” so only there can she accept the message.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><answer>Dominant stake—discover the intention encoded—tightens once: the final sequence converts curiosity into obligated action. No external antagonist is needed; the buried message itself escalates by revealing Clara’s name, date, and coordinates, forcing Margot from observer to executor. Cost is visible—she now shoulders a forty-year-old secret on a timetable. Under Accumulative lens the pattern break (name/date) is the single decisive intensification.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><answer>Theme emerges obliquely: tending the dead is not morbid stewardship but reciprocal cultivation—some seeds of intention require living hands to flower. Subtext lives in mirrored burials (Edmund/Clara kept apart) and the gardener’s final acceptance that graves are not endpoints but plots for future bloom. No moralizing; the closing line’s agricultural metaphor reweights the entire premise. Ambiguity lingers—was the message meant for her, or is she merely the first to listen?</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Margot’s perceptual filter—she notices soil settlement, thread tension, starlight pooling, never cemetery administrivia. Syntax lengthens in calmer decoding moments, then compresses into single-clause lifts at the reveal (“Clara Voss. Coordinates. A date.”), mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; diction stays within a gardener’s lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control earns the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is selective and paid off: “soil settles after rain” returns as seed-bloom closure. No mixed metaphors; “velveteen gloom” justifies its adjective by wrapping physically around her shoulders. One paraphrase loop detected (“grief and curiosity had always felt...like the same thing wearing different faces”) but it lands at a reflective beat, not under peak pressure. Otherwise density is high—each sentence advances decoding or stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chess–tapestry cipher is not a gimmick but a lived emblem of long-married estrangement; encoding coordinates in knots literalizes the phrase “tied up in the past.” Risk taken: forty-year lag, no living antagonist, yet pressure holds. Specificity—blithe cemetery gardener, frost-heaved grave, sovereign case—makes the premise unforgettable. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
