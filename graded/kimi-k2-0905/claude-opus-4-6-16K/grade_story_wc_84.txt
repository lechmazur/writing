<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her aerial distance now internalized—and the chip/hand-off beat forces a micro-choice that tilts her stance. The pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” face is shown only once; we never see it complicate an action, so the trait stays ornamental. Closure’s shift from absence-as-wound to absence-as-invitation is legible, but the cost is more asserted than embodied on her body or voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reweights the premise—gaps become invitation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: chip → spectrograph → waveform → re-calibration, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. Cost is conceptual (the silence they now choose to inhabit) rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory’s crumbling dome, star trails, and spectrograph slot are tactile, specific, and filter through Maren’s surveyor gaze. Light, brass, and perforations recur with shifting valence, charging the final “brilliant dimness.” Environment never constrains a physical choice, so it falls short of the 9+ gate, but sensory economy is exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and tightens once: the chip turns static data into breath-like waveforms, narrowing options from “solve” to “listen.” Escalation is textural, not causal, but legitimate under the lens. No visible price is paid (time, risk, or forfeiture), so pressure intensifies intellectually rather than viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of star trails, perforations, and silence: belonging is an unfinished cadence. The final reconfiguration—gaps as invitation—avails a counter-reading without moralizing. Subtext in the pilgrim’s wrapped bundle and Maren’s recalibration gesture carries the emotional freight, letting the concept breathe beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual grid: distances inside her, terrain viewed from above, star trails as punctuation. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her attention; no filter-verb clutter. The pilgrim’s dialogue is spare but idiom-true; voice never converges. One lyrical lift—“unfinished sentence” sky—earns its place through prior pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (star-trails as punctuation, gaps as music) stay coherent and non-competing. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; high information density without overcrowding the 775-word frame. A single clause—“the distances lived inside her”—could be trimmed, but it does not blunt momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Repurposing a type-matrix chip as stellar filter feels inevitable yet fresh; the analog/digital marriage reframes “frequency of belonging” as typographic constellation. The observatory ruin plus drone-pilot exile is a specific synthesis, not stock aesthetic. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but the pattern is taught early and pays off, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
