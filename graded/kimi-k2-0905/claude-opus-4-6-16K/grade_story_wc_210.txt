<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s refusal to leave the ghost town is embodied through her nightly tending of gardens and spoken-to-herself voice; the sealed amber bottle externalizes her bottled-up archive of civilizational memory. Her interior contradiction—clinging to a dead place while rejecting “false comfort”—is dramatized when she presses the bottle to her temple and trades solitude for creative reconstruction. The cost is visible: she forfeits the mainland’s safety and accepts the slower, uncertain labor of revival. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“she had always been someone who rejects false comfort”) that momentarily lifts the veil into thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: after the bottle’s resonance reveals the civilization encoded in her, Maren descends to begin rebuilding; the image reweights the entire ghost town from corpse to blueprint. Causality holds: because the well dried, everyone left; because she stayed, she found the archive-instrument; because the bottle amplified memory, she can now act. Cost is legible in her dawn-bare streets and the forfeited safety Drace bought with the last wish. Drive lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that culminates in her decisive first step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is pressed into service: rusted lantern hooks, bleached paper shells, and the empty cove are not backdrop but evidence of civic death. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting—its seamless, warm surface is handled in every beat and finally charges the ridge-top image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s alchemical eye: salt air corrosion, fossilized-honey color, geothermal channel diagrams. Spatial choreography is clean; the ridge descent mirrors her internal shift from observation to action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive a civilization—tightens when the bottle reveals the archive inside her, turning survival into reconstruction. Escalation is single but sufficient: from maintenance (gardens, spoken words) to creation (blueprints for tidal generators, salt-crystal purifiers). The tightening forces a trade-off: she must abandon the safety of nostalgia and risk failure on untested designs. Agency is continuous; each micro-choice (heat, acid, temple-press) probes the constraint until the final shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as renewable material, alchemy as cultural recombination. The amber bottle’s unopenable seal becomes a metaphor for civilization that can only be re-imagined, not uncorked intact. Subtextual charge: paper lanterns once community-lit now ghost-swaying, invert the usual “light equals hope” trope—hope is internalized, engineered. Final image reweights prior motifs: the cove is no longer a grave but a construction site, achieving resonance without moralizing.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is alchemist-precise: “fossilized honey,” “luminous suspension,” syntax layered like mineral salts. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in the empty town, staccato blueprint list at the climax. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clutter. Compression is purposeful: “the harder, slower, truer thing” crystallizes the thematic pivot in five words. Perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices corrosion, geothermal channels, salt crystals; the world is read as transmutable matter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or concept. Metaphors are anchored: “the cove held its silence like a held breath” is physical and stakes-relevant. No mixed vehicles; fossil, salt, and crystal motifs form a coherent mineral through-line. Opening and closing lines book-end with motion: from still lanterns to her descent “toward the cove and began,” propelling the reader off the page.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic留守 + magical object is refreshed by treating civilization as an alchemical formula stored in working memory. Risk: sealed bottle that never opens—yet this refusal of reveal becomes the conceptual pivot, not a cheat. Specificity of tidal-alchemy culture (geothermal channels, salt-crystal lattices) makes the premise unswapable. Final reconfiguration—ghost town as laboratory—feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
