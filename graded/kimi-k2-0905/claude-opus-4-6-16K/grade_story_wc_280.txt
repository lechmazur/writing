<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lushly synesthetic and character-particular (“applause tasted of warm bread”), but Marguerite never faces an on-page contradiction or renunciation; her gift simply flows. Darla’s shift is credibly triggered by the coin, yet we remain outside her final micro-choice. Ghostly stasis counts as “Earned Stasis” only if the text shows the cost of remaining—here the cost is implied, not dramatized—so the closure barely meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin passage reweights both women’s futures with unmistakable felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality within the orchard is coherent, but the maze-to-orchard transition rules are never taught or constrained, so the privet parting reads as soft miracle. Orientation is waived because disorientation pays off in the final image, yet the lack of a limiting rule caps the score just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silver-barked apple trees and humming fruit are not mere scenery—they open only when the hedge chooses, directly enabling the encounter and charging the final lullaby echo. Synesthetic filters keep every detail character-bound (“colors only Marguerite could taste”) and guide the beat: the coin’s pigment tastes of burnt honey, fusing object, body, and decision. Micro-setting (the hedge wall) physically gate-keeps the stakes, meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ghost offers possibility to despairing stranger—tightens once when the coin crosses the hedge, foreclosing Marguerite’s solitude and Darla’s stasis. Agency is one-directional (Marguerite acts, Darla receives), so pressure escalates by deepening texture rather than by reversible conflict. Cost is legible: the orchard’s lullaby now belongs to future wanderers, a tangible forfeiture of Marguerite’s private eternity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: performance as posthumous gift, nostalgia as renewable sustenance. The returning lullaby and coin reprise reweight the opening image—echoes once trapped in silver bark now migrate beyond the hedge—without any final moral. Ambiguity persists: is Marguerite freed or further scattered? The aftertaste of warm bread and copper rain invites reflection rather than resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature throughout: “ fractured splintering into overlapping moments that layered like transparencies on an old projector.” Rhythm modulates with emotional swell, compressing into appositive clusters during the lullaby release, then exhaling in the final sentence. No head-hop; Darla’s sensations are filtered solely through observable effect (“she would later swear--of warm bread”). Diction stays within ghostly lexicon; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future payoff (“apples sang frequencies that tasted of cinnamon and electric blue” primes synesthetic rule). Mixed metaphors are avoided; theater-curtain groan segues cleanly into silver-bark tableau. Zero paraphrase loops, zero template cadence. Final line lands with crisp monosyllabic cadence—“She had always loved an encore”—providing clean closure punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ghost-orchard nested inside a commercial hedge maze is non-obvious; synesthetic afterlife band makes the concept specific rather than generic. Tarot coin reprises as both prop and hinge without feeling inserted. The risk of sentimental haunt is evaded by letting the gift keep traveling outward. While posthumous performance trope exists, the sonic-fruit and time-splinter mechanics feel freshly synthesized.</comment>
