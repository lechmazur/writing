<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the thermal-mapping device literalizes “silent expressiveness” under pressure. Contradictory impulse—yearning for music while fearing sound—emerges early and culminates in the wind-downbeat moment, earning a quiet renunciation with cost. The single-POV default is met; no on-page relationships to test status. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: she risks sensor pain to harvest memory-heat, then seals the score and steps outside, trading safety for potential sonic exposure. Flaw balance: hyperacusis is clinical label-speak, but it is immediately embodied and drives every beat, so the diagnostic mention is functional, not abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wind-gust becomes a “downbeat” she accepts, reweighting silence from void to medium. Causal chain holds: capsizing → hyperacusis → residency → thermal mapping → score → exposure choice; each step eliminates options. Orientation anchors by line 5; no penalty. Single continuous scene meets default; one transition (weeks compressed into “following weeks”) is legitimate summary. Cost is visible on final line: bodily flinch followed by warmth = she will bear sound again, price unmeasured. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Winterglass panels “swallow vibration” and literally force her invention of thermal notation—environment as constraint charging closure. Body-as-micro-setting: mastoid ache, sternal heat, throat amber all ground spatial orientation inside the skin. Object-as-setting: tuning-fork case recycled for sensors recurs twice, final seal carries reweighted meaning. Selective sensory hierarchy (absence of sound heightens touch/temperature) keeps description purposeful and urgent. No credibility errors; conservatory rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled in third paragraph and tightened when she maps the capsizing drone: failure would leave her with “a single held frequency that refused to stop.” One meaningful escalation: she decides to walk outside into potential noise; option set narrows from absolute silence to conditional exposure. Agency is renunciation/endurance—she accepts the wind’s sound as first note, paying with bodily flinch. No external antagonist needed; internal threshold supplies pressure. Cost is legible on last line, satisfying 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as fertile medium rather than absence—emerges through thermal images, not assertion. Subtextual irony: the ear is ruined, yet the sternum “hears” and composes. Final image reweights the opening promise (“conservatory built to house sound”) by housing it in flesh instead of air, a non-literal answer. Moral complexity preserved: she may suffer for this music, but the story neither condemns nor celebrates, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Maren’s sensory bandwidth; no head-hop. Prose rhythm mimics wave-motion—long sentences for memory, abrupt fragments for flinch. Perceptual signature is thermo-acoustic: she “reads” color-spread on skin the way she once read staves. No dialogue, so voice distinction untested; internal diction remains composer-specific (“rectify the intervals,” “bones were honest”). Register stable; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences propel: “She pressed...mapped...transcribed” carries three actions in one line. Figurative control—glass ribs, tuning-fork hull—never collides or repeats; each metaphor is used once and paid for. Zero loops, scaffolds, or paraphrase. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“She already knew the note”). Variation in sentence length creates natural breath; no algorithmic patterns. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—composing through heat-mapping silence—is non-obvious and inseparable from protagonist’s injury. Thermal notation grows organically from capsizing detail (salt-stained case refitted with sensors), transforming familiar trauma-recovery arc into compositional thriller. Risk of experimental concept is fully committed to; no retreat to safe sentiment. Specificity of Adriatic sailboat pitch vs. “golden sail” memory prevents template drift. Fresh inflection at end: wind becomes downbeat, repricing silence as score.</comment>
