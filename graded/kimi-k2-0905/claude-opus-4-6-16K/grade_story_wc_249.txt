<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—compliance vs. quiet rebellion—drives every micro-choice (drumming on her own sternum port). Embodied emotion (“surgical port still ached”) anchors motive; the final heartbeat-sync stakes her body as cost. No head-hop; Lior exists only as reflection, so relationship crucible waived. Earned stasis: she refuses severance, pays with permanent entanglement risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the golden lagoon materializes and Lior’s heartbeat answers—conceptual cost (she’s locked into sustaining a dream-door forever). Causal lens holds: because she drums, the garden responds; because the garden responds, the monitor spikes. Orientation anchored by word 60. No plot amnesia; electrode scars and day-count maintain continuity. Cost is visible in the final image—“she would keep it open”—foreclosing return to baseline.</comment>

<comment>Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop; its physics (vibration → visible phenomena) supplies the means and stakes—drumming literally conjures the lagoon. The crystalline stalks and membrane walls constrain her tactics: only acoustic input works. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the surgical port on her sternum is a tactile object that aches under percussion, charging final image. Spatial choreography clean; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep the entanglement alive—signaled by paragraph 3. Single meaningful tightening: garden shifts from therapeutic tool to life-support system; option to “sever” is foreclosed when she commits to drumming. agency is continuous (every strike escalates risk). Cost visible: she accepts lifelong cognitive instability for a heartbeat echo. Coincidence (monitor spike) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: love as refusal to forget when forgetting is clinically mandated. No explicit thesis; final image reweights earlier “error” into sacred pact. Motif of shared golden shore recurs with shifted meaning—from symptom to sanctuary. Subtext in gesture: palm pressed to lagoon = vow. Resists moral binaries; doctors’ “greater good” remains plausible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter—sound-to-color synesthesia rendered in exact, idiosyncratic nouns (“copper lip,” “violet light arches”). Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure (“Drumming on everything was the only method that worked”). No head-hop; reflection-Lior’s independent movement is framed as observed phenomenon. Register stays within her embodied lexicon—no academic leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or filler; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language sparse and precise (“lowest frequencies pooled like warm fog”)—never clogs climax. Strong verbs (“cascading,” “spiraling,” “shimmered”) propel momentum. Copy-clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity. Final line cadence mirrors heartbeat, paying off drumming motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic neurology + lyric elegy. Memory-transfer trope is subverted—entanglement becomes chosen intimacy rather than pathology. Golden lagoon is not generic afterlife but acoustic hologram born of percussive love. Risk taken: climax is a reflection and a monitor blip, yet pressure holds. Specificity of surgical port and electrode scars anchors SF conceit in flesh.</comment>
