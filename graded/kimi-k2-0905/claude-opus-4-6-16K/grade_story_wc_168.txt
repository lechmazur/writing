<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to release her daughter—are alive in every tactile beat (how she grips box, pencil, envelope). The final micro-choice, sliding the letter into a stamped envelope she’s carried six years, crystallizes the arc with visible cost: the box is lighter, the path down now one-way. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “bargained innocence” is re-translated into fire-survival imagery. Only keeps this from 9+ is a hairline excess of retrospective summary just before the ridge summit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: unsent stack becomes sent letter, foreclosing the safety of private guilt. Causal lens holds throughout—every reflective paragraph is tethered to present handling of box, pencil, planets; the final act is motivated by the prior six years of failed attempts shown in-scene. Cost is legible in the last line: “lighter now,” a physical subtraction that signals irreversible exposure to Lily’s judgment. No orientation or continuity errors; even planetary conjunction pays off as temporal marker and metaphor for closing distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Body-as-setting (scarred forearms, grafted hands) constrains how Maren grips objects and therefore whether she can risk another failure; ridge granite’s retained warmth provides the only comfort allowed, sharpening the solitude. Celestial alignment functions as micro-setting clock, tightening the moment to a twenty-year window, hence pressuring the decision tonight. Sensory selection favors heat, weight, texture over visual panorama, matching a firefighter’s trained priorities. Environment never over-described; each detail earns its place by affecting stance or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she finally mail the letter—tightens once: from box-as-excuse to envelope-as-exposure. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each unsent letter in the cache increases the psychic cost of trying again; the planetary conjunction supplies external deadline. Final narrowing occurs when she chooses to carry the envelope instead of returning it to the cracked box—option to retreat is foreclosed. Price (irreversible vulnerability) is visible on-page in the tactile shift of weight she must now literally carry downhill.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of post-fire growth emerges through the single green shoot image rather than thesis statement; the reader reweights “bargained innocence” as irreversible yet survivable. Subtext resides in objects: cracked box = fractured parenthood; planets = rare alignments of courage. Final image reframes earlier fires as preparatory scar-tissue, not punishment. Avoids moralizing; growth is offered, not guaranteed, keeping ambiguity alive.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter—every observed detail (scar silver, hot granite, planetary math) is something a firefighter would catalog under stress. Syntax lengthens in calmer reflection, then shortens to fragments during the envelope decision, mirroring pulse. No filter-verb clutter; verbs like “slid,” “pressed,” “tucked” keep agency on the body. Voice remains distinct even in lyrical mode because diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs three jobs—advances action, carries metaphor, reveals character (“Precision born not from ease but from the consequence of its absence”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse enough that each image lands clean. Rhythm modulates without drumbeat monotony; paragraph cuts are surgical. Only a single near-repeat (“six years” twice in close proximity) prevents perfect 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar parental-guilt terrain is refreshed through wild-land-fire competence and the cracked porcelain reliquary of baby teeth—specific lived detail transforms trope. Risk is taken in near-plotless lyric structure, yet causal pressure keeps it narrative rather than vignette. Final reconfiguration (send, not store) feels inevitable yet not predictable. Could push further into unexplored emotional territory for 9+, but remains memorable.</comment>
