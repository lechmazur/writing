<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marguerite’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to “contain” absence—activate simultaneously in every cut; the micro-choice to carve while the kettle boils turns the blank into a vessel that reweights survival itself. The ash curls embody visible cost, and her final “steady vessel” stance is earned because the carving literally forecloses drowning. Flaw: the early “here and gone” refrain edges toward label-speak before the first chip falls, shaving the last 0.1.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rough lion on the sill crystallizes the emptiness into a survivable shape, undeniable cost visible in the blood-rust grain. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory shard (rain-light, tobacco ghost, ash curls) layers density until the final cadence shift (“this was not a tragedy but a rhythm”) reconfigures the stakes without causal reversal. No orientation debt; the loft anchors by word 40. Only the brief “national news” aside is an untapped causal thread, keeping it from 9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: the amber-rust spectrum stains both wood and memory, guiding the knife’s shallow grooves and charging the lion’s final color. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every curl lands on the table, boots hold their absent shape, kettle steam rises and vanishes in sync with “here and gone.” The iron stove’s heat is never tactile, denying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn absence into a containable shape—tightens once: the first cut makes retreat impossible, each shaving narrows the option to flee back into formless grief. Under Accumulative lens the deepening is the visible pile of curls; cost is the irreversible rough lion that now occupies the shelf. No secondary reversal is needed, yet the pressure plateau is flat between cuts; a mid-process splinter or slip would have forced adaptation and pushed 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulate: ash wood = crematory echo, carving = inverse taxidermy, lion = both killer and keeper of the man. The final rust-hued peace is a conceptual repricing that reframes “here and gone” as heartbeat, not loss. No moralizing, only the bitter tea that swallows the viewer into the same rhythm. The refrain edges toward echo once; otherwise immaculate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains a circus-performer’s lyric compression—“droplets freckling the glass like a constellation mapped in water”—without ever breaking into explanatory prose. Syntax lengthens under memory pressure, then fractures into knife-short beats, mirroring the kettle’s rising whine. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; even the free-indirect “he had never retired” is anchored in her muscle memory. Voice is irreplaceable.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “The first curl of ash fell to the table” advances action, evokes cremation, and textures air. Metaphors stay coherent within the rust/amber spectrum; no mixed vehicle collisions. One paraphrase loop—“here and gone, here and gone”—is pattern-taught and paid off, so exempt. A single adverbial hedge (“hauntingly practical”) is permitted by POV lexicon. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Grief-carving as containment reverses the usual souvenir; the lion is both murderer and relic, a non-obvious synthesis. Circus-widow trope is refreshed by refusing spectacle—no flashback to mauling, only the boots that still hold his arch. Risk-taking lies in the lyric kettle-clock structure, which pays off in rhythmic closure. Could edge 9+ with one more concrete circus artifact repurposed mid-scene.</comment>
