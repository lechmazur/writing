<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete embodied choices (planting, pearl practice) anchor Noor’s interior; the freeze response is dramatized, not labeled. Motivation is consistent and stakes personal, but the single on-page decision (pinning the photo) is small for the word-count; cost is felt yet not foregrounded enough for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds sensory density until the pearl moment reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—photo pinned, panic survived—cost legible in crooked lavender and trembling hands. One transition (Sanaa flashback) is cleanly cued; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salvaged lighthouse glass greenhouse, salt-thyme between flagstones, copper light on Aleppo pines—selective, POV-filtered, and tactile. The crumpled photo acts as micro-setting that charges the final image; environment guides her daily ritual and constrains what can grow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bodily safety from memory-triggered freeze. Escalation is textural—drill shriek breaks pattern, pearl breath reconfigures options. Cost visible in shaking hands and crooked planting; agency is endurance rather than external action, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: survival as cultivation—both trees and self. Subtext in photo pinning: memory not buried but exposed to salt air. No moralizing; resonance lingers in blurred dress and copper light reweighting “optimism in realism.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tight to Noor’s perceptual filter: salt wind, heartbeat under sternum, “pearl of stillness” kept within her diction. Rhythm modulates—long horticultural sentences broken by short freezes; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “thyme that grew wild between the flagstones” does two jobs (texture + survival). One paraphrase loop (“she survived because…she survived because”) is tolerated as thematic anaphora; no mixed metaphors or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wedding-to-craterr arborist survivor angle feels specific; arboretum-as-therapy not template. Risk lies in quiet lyric stasis—works here because cliff-salt constraints and pearl image repay the gamble.</comment>
