<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s archaeologist-careful temperament is etched into every gesture; her “kindly methodical” nature shows in how she grips the seed like a fragile tablet, letting reverence overrule fear. The contradiction between scientific detachment and aching grief drives every beat, culminating in the micro-choice to plant rather than pocket the seed—an act that simultaneously buries and memorializes Tomasz. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak; “translation is not departure” lands as earned synthesis. Cost is palpable: she trades the comfort of mystery for the burden of legible memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the magnetic branch Elara authors becomes a living lexicon that rewrites death from void into syntax, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The text teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—nested metaphors stack like tablets, each analogical door thickening interpretive density—then crystallizes when the new branch trembles upward, a final image that reconfigures her stance under sky without ceiling. Causality holds: because she deciphers, therefore she climbs; because she plants, therefore the tree remembers. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 4 and accrue magnetic texture without stall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arbor is no backdrop; its field lines tug fillings in teeth and iron in blood, forcing Elara’s micro-choices—hair lifting, compass-bones humming—so environment literally steers her grip. Clouds glow amber beneath her boots, a micro-setting that charges the final upward gaze. Every sensory pick is filtered through translator-bias: she “reads” the way metal smells, notices absence the way others note cold. Setting constrains the climax: only magnetic soil can germinate the seed, making the planting irrevocable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she learn the grammar of death?”—tightens once: hoard the seed (safe ignorance) vs. plant it (risk legible loss). Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reversal; each nested metaphor increments interpretive pressure until refusal becomes impossible. Agency is clean: no outside antagonist, only the accruing weight of untranslated grief. Cost is visible—she kneels, weeps, and forever forfeits the luxury of not-knowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the translatability of loss: death is not erasure but recoding into an idiom one may yet learn. Subtext lives in gesture—seed pressed between converging roots mimics cuneiform wedge driven into clay. No thematic statement is declaimed; the final branch tremoring toward an open sky reweights every prior tablet fragment. Moral ambiguity lingers: knowledge extends the arbor, yet also ossifies the dead into readable structure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice carries scholar-poet precision: Latinate cadence (“cathedral of living iron”) braided with tactile immediacy (“hummed in her teeth”). Perceptual signature is translator-vision—magnetic lines are read like sentences, grief handled as philological puzzle. Syntax mirrors content: long, branching clauses replicate arbor architecture, then tighten into monosyllables at climax (“She knelt”). No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under static charge without breaking idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose density is high—figurative layering in nearly every sentence—yet pattern is taught early and pays off in closure image, avoiding artifact flag. No loops, no synonym churn; each metaphor extends the magnetic field conceit without contradiction. Rhythm accelerates into staccato beats as the seed opens, then exhales into the final long sentence of weeping and growth. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by living image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cuneiform philology with magnetospheric botany—an angle not seen before. The “knowledge fruit seed” could feel gaming-manual twee, yet here it inherits millennia of scribal anxiety about permanence versus erasure. Risk is high—lyric accretion instead of plot reversals—but coherence under the accretive lens vindicates the gamble. Transformation test fails: swap translator for any other seeker and the entire analogical grammar collapses.</comment>
