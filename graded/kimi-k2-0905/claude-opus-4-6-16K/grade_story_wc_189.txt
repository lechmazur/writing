<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet observational stance feels authentic, but the six-year estrangement and the cremation reveal are told rather than dramatized; the pivot from rehearsed anger to sideways truth-telling is declared, not embodied in a micro-choice we witness. The final acceptance lands gently via image rather than visible cost, so the arc is credible but not yet wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the jade hand-off and incoming tide crystallize the decision to reconnect, with the cicada’s weight and the merging pools making the cost felt. Causality is lyric-Accumulative; each tidal metaphor accretes until the final image reweights the estrangement. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; no lens contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grotto ceiling wound, starlight on jade veins, and the audible rising tide give tactile, specific anchors that guide the emotional turn. The tidal pool becomes a micro-setting that literally charges the final image as water reconnects isolated basins, mirroring the father-daughter reconnection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to stay angry or re-engage—is signaled early; the tightening is the father’s revelation of the secret cremation. Maren’s agency is her choice of tangential speech rather than confrontation; the cost is the relinquishment of six years of rehearsed anger, but because the price is more conceptual than visceral, the escalation feels moderate rather than shattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tidal imagery rather than statement: time, form, and connection are cyclical, not linear. The final image of merging pools offers a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger while still feeling complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in Maren’s scientific diction—“texture of time,” “liminal hours”—that fades slightly in the father’s one line. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation, no head-hopping; the cicada and tide motifs recur with purposeful compression rather than repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and mostly loop-free; one scaffold cluster—“between tides, between seasons, between one breath”—is deliberate pattern-teaching rather than artifact. Metaphors stay coherent; no register drift; final sentence propels with open cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal-pool “texture of time” concept feels fresh, and the cicada resurrection motif is subtly reversed—daughter receives rather than buries. Risk is moderate: lyric structure replaces confrontation with image, but the synthesis still feels specific to this voice and shore rather than template.</comment>
