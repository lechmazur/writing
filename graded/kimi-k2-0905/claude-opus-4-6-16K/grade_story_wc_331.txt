<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s odd-hour need, hyperbolic filing obsession, and scarf-handling embody a coherent, eccentric interiority; the final “wait” is a quiet endurance that forecloses nothing new yet carries ancestral cost. No contradictory impulses collide on-page; all drive flows toward the shelving crescendo. Grandmother’s voice is texture, not pressure, so the arc is more mood-glow than crucible, but the motives stay particular and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shelving micro-act thickens library “hum” until the final Charged Poise reconfigures silence itself. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4; no drift. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—books curve toward one another, space remembered—cost felt in Maren’s motionless wait and Paul’s hush. Pattern taught early (entropy/geometry metaphors) pays off in the closing hush without causal trickery.</comment>

<comment>Ground-floor ex-telegraph office, hyperbolic shelves, scarf-as-antenna—each item is handled, re-handled, and finally charges the hush. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile paper-static and faint auditory hum, mirroring Maren’s synesthetic quest. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Maren moves from desk → aisles → desk. Micro-setting (scarf) literally tunes the resonance that ends the piece, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where stories live”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via each calculated placement until the hum re-weights the air. Agency is cumulative attention, not reversal; options narrow to stillness and listening. No external antagonist or reversal, but the library’s rising resonance forces collective stance crystallization. Cost is the unspoken knowledge that the space, not Maren, now dictates the terms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—analog memory as lived curvature—emerges through shelving choreography and scarf texture, never thesis. Subtext hums in the gap between copper wire static and hyperbolic divergence, resolved when books “curve gently toward one another.” Final image reweights earlier metaphors without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: digital precision is loss, yet the cost is quiet acceptance, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s perceptual filter—entropy-poet, geometry-obsessed, synesthetic. Rhythm swells and hushes with shelving motion; diction stays scholarly yet tactile (“grain and hiss”). No head-hop; Paul remains opaque observer. Compression in final paragraph mirrors the curvature concept without losing clarity; scarf as antenna is a consistent metaphoric instrument, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence, accelerating with shelving then subsiding into hush. Mixed metaphors avoided; “hyperbolic geometry of memory” stays coherent. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One minor scaffold—“the quality of silence within it”—could trim “within it,” but artifact does not touch closure. High density: each line adds image, motion, or concept; no filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses thermodynamics, hyperbolic maths, and telephone-operator haunt into an inevitable lyric whole. Risk of preciousness is navigated via concrete shelving action and scarf handling. Final reactivation of historic signal feels surprising yet foreshadowed by grandmother’s copper hiss. Not radical in shape, but the synthesis is specific and memorable; removal of any core metaphor would collapse the resonance.</comment>
