<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sable’s quiet, indexer-brain interiority is vivid and consistent; the contradictory pull between scholarly rigor and the exhilaration of discovery is embodied in micro-choices—prying the cabinet, testing the stamp, forcing the “readjust.” The final decision to index the truth is credible and carries clear professional/ethical cost, satisfying Earned Stasis. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. Only the +0.2 to reach 9+ is missing: the stamp-constraint could have bitten even harder (e.g., jeopardizing air supply) to crystallize stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → silence → discovery → self-interrogation → indexing act. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 6; no penalty. Closure is a decisive, on-page renunciation with felt cost: “her contract would likely end” + the weight of the stamp. Persistent constraint—the consortium’s displeasure—shapes the final tactic, satisfying 9+ quick test. Micro-turn occurs when she pivots from excitement to disciplined “readjust,” tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment acts as pressure vessel: blackout removes HVAC hum, returns “original silence”; kelp glow and salt-slick cabinet physically guide pacing and tool use. The stamp itself functions as micro-setting/object, charging the final image when it “sat on the rail, real and heavy.” Spatial choreography remains clean—no impossible reaches. Just shy of 9 because the library’s larger layout (distance to ascent hatch, water level) could have constrained tactics even more sharply.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intellectual honesty vs. career security—signals early and tightens once: disproving the grant thesis endangers her job. The “readjust” beat is the meaningful narrowing; options collapse from “publish unbiased index” to “accept exile.” Cost is visible on-page: “her contract would likely end.” Agency is cerebral but sufficient for indexer character. No external antagonist needed; internal method vs. evidence drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as reclamation vs. institutional erasure. Subtext lives in silence metaphors and the stamp’s “closed eye.” Final image—pencil writing the incendiary entry—reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo violations. Complexity lingers: truth-telling is simultaneously triumph and self-exile.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“barnacled halls,” “dappled resolve”) is character-appropriate, lyrical yet precise. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for calm, clipped clauses for discovery beats. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. Only hairline slip: “she felt dappled resolve” edges toward label, but is instantly anchored in bodily stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry high density: sensory, causal, and thematic work simultaneously. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“stillness held her like water holds a stone”). Opening and closing lines are image-driven and propulsive. Copy clean; minor possessive comma optional but not penalized.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sunken librarian reframes archaeology tropes via cataloguing POV; originality lies in method as plot. The blackout-silence engine repurposes setting into antagonist force. Bone-stamp date twist is grounded, not gimmick. Specific professional detail (ink under magnifier, concept-based ledger) freshens familiar “lost truth” arc. Risk feels moderate but coherent; no derivative premise penalty.</comment>
