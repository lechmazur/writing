<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nadia’s survivor-grief is rendered in concrete micro-choices—pocketing the coordinates, touching the geode—rather than labels. The contradiction between scheduled science and illicit hunt is kept alive in scene, and the final renunciation (returning to “authorized sweep”) carries a felt cost: she forfeits immediate justice for a private future weapon. Interiority stays particular to her warped perceptual lens (“distance… she could bruise herself against”). The only bar to 9+ is that the emotional plateau after the discovery is slightly summarized rather than embodied in a last beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene anchor (who/where/when) is nailed inside 70 words; the 40-minute circuit-breaker clock supplies causal urgency. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she chooses institutional complicity, now charged by secret knowledge, geode in pocket—cost legible as permanent internal exile. Drive lens is Causal: each action (model perturbation, mark private drive, pocket coordinates) narrows her moral options. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the coolant reset that ends her window is set up early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating observatory is sketched with sensory economy—“indifference of stratospheric winds”—and immediately constrains action: isolation grants unfiltered data and protects her from ground fire. The geode operates as micro-setting, its split crystals mirroring the “pooled” dark-mass knot she locates. Dim red emergency lighting and cooling-pump hum thread through beats, keeping atmosphere taut. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find hidden potential before the coolant resets—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she marks private coordinates, forfeiting institutional cover. One meaningful reversal: anomaly found → must conceal it. Cost is visible: she risks charges of treason if discovered. Pressure stays causal under the ticking breaker clock; no coincidences rescue her. Sufficient for 8+ band; to reach 9 the text would need a sharper physical jeopardy or irrevocable act within the window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—the universe and survivors both hoard unspent, dangerous potential—emerges through parallel imagery (geode / dark-mass pool) rather than statement. Final image of “broken-open” observer reweights the wedding rubble memory without moralizing. Subtext of complicity—she now possesses a silent weapon—lands via gesture (pocketing drive) not exposition. Ambiguity is productive: is she future avenger or another latent threat? No thematic echo penalties apply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance, filtering scientific diction through grief-tinged perception—“every equation was a body.” Rhythm compresses under time pressure, then exhales in the final sentence; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue to test, yet interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Voice specificity is high: “geometries of war,” “stillborn stellar nurseries.” Sustains 8.8; 9+ would require even more idiosyncratic syntactic tics or sonic patterning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “Below, the same country that killed her husband continues its geometries of war” situates, characterizes, and moralizes in thirteen words. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate: “crystals like frozen light” appears once and pays off thematically. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines bookend with crystalline imagery, giving cadence punch. One hairline slip—“specific feeling of finding something enormous”—is generic, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of drone-survivor grief with dark-matter cartography is non-obvious and fully committed; removing either layer collapses the story. The geode metaphor could feel convenient, yet here it materially shapes the climax (she pockets coordinates next to it) and reconfigures the wedding memory at exit. Risk of high-concept sci-fi gloss is avoided by grounded sensory specifics and on-page ethical cost. Fresh inflection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
