<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s synesthetic tasting of memories is concrete and character-specific (rusted rail→champagne spill). Interior contradiction pulses: caretaker tenderness vs saboteur resolve, shown through micro-choices—pruning, kissing fruit, deciding soup. Motivation scales from personal nostalgia to insurgent pedagogy; final renunciation (no manifesto, only ladling) carries visible social cost—discovery = death. Only reason not 9+: no on-page relationship pressure; all conflict is internal/societal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: fruit wrapped, streets “about to remember,” cost legible—twelve years of clandestine work now irretrievably risked. Causal chain intact: alignment light→ripe fruit→prune/harvest→soup plot; each action forecloses alternatives. Backstory fragments (<20%) always cue present motion (tasting rail triggers greenhouse entry). No orientation debt; lens (Causal) holds to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse skeleton, violet shimmer, and celestial spectrum are selective, tactile, and steer choice (light gap dictates pruning timing). Body-as-micro-setting appears—tongue as archive, thumb on rust—constraining what she can know or reveal. Weather/alignment function as live clock, not backdrop. One detail short of 9: setting could have bitten back (cut hand on glass, etc.) to sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore cognitive hunger without capture—signaled by line 10. One tightening: ripening window narrows choice to harvest now or lose decade of work; pruning is irreversible commitment. Stakes remain personal rather than multi-level; no credible resource loss (knife, time, stamina) shown on page. Still, agency drives every beat; cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete paradox: outlawed beauty as insurgency—soup而非子彈。Refrains of taste/memory and ruined glass accumulate to final Conceptual Repricing: “beauty was the one language power could never fully outlaw.” No moralizing; resonance lingers in half-lit indigo fruit. Complexity intact—she feeds, but also manipulates brains; reader left tasting ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s synesthetic wavelength: “taste of a meteorologist’s notebook,” “roots beneath the floor still remembered.” Compression taught early (“That was the trouble…”) and paid off in closing kiss. Rhythm modulates—long sensuous sentences for tasting, clipped horticultural diction for pruning. No POV leakage; knowledge capped at her folk-calculation level. Distinctive but one hair below 9 for occasional luxuriant phrases that slightly dilute tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence fronts, no paraphrase loops. Figurative layering high but patterned and purposeful; vehicles stay consistent (iron, blood, starlight). One scaffold: “She let them pass through her and kept cutting” restates prior beat. Information density excellent—single sentences do memory-taste + botany + political stakes. Line-level craft sustains climax without artifact.</comment>

<comment>Synesthetic chef-as-memory-keeper feels novel yet inevitable; “taste the archive” fuses sensory and epistemic plots. Knowledge-fruit encoding plasticity is hard-SF glossed through folk science, avoiding infodump. Rebellion via humble soup subverts usual dystopic fireworks. Specificity throughout (champagne on shoes, indigo shift under spectral light) prevents template feel; risk refines rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
