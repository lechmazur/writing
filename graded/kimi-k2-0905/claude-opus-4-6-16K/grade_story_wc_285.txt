<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fen’s layered regrets and the needle-turn tic are vivid, but the passenger’s interior remains sealed; her nod accepts his offer yet costs her nothing on the page, so the crucible moment feels one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ticking gutter–to–ferry sequence tightens once, palimpsest metaphor reweights at closure, and the cost is legible in Fen’s quiet surrender of solitude; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, planks, and the yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains Fen’s choice to speak; the river’s “page turning” recharges the palimpsest image at exit, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Fen’s vow to stay attentive—tightens when the passenger’s need intrudes; the single deepening is Fen’s spoken offer, paid for with the foreclosed solitude he’d promised himself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure/re-inscription emerges through fog, road loss, and needle; final image of the river “turning the page” reconfigures the promise palimpsest without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature—sound-colored heron call, gutter ticks as clock—remains consistent; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final ferry image; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with weather, no loops; some sentences carry triple duty (e.g., “promise…same scrap of soul”). Minor overwrought phrases—“silence feel like sound”—but none touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Road-swallowed-by-river is familiar, yet the needle-as-thinking-tool and gutter-tick clock give fresh specificity; palimpsest conceit is transformed into lived ritual rather than abstract trope.</comment>
