<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—grief, guilt, filial loyalty, scientific rigor—co-exist in every beat; the decision to mail the envelope is earned through three years of logged contradiction and the immediate trigger of Dao’s tremulous voice. Embodied cost is legible in the “rich and certain” ink pool and the grim smile while she watches Lansdell’s lights—she forfeits the safety of silence forever. No safety-hedging: the arc accepts irreversible moral damage. Micro-choice hierarchy (archival proof over family myth) is visible on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Dao’s call resurrects the comet, therefore Marguerite performs the proof, therefore she mails the truth—each linkage narrows her options. Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable cost: the sealed envelope forecloses her inherited immunity. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“9:47 p.m.”, “great dome”, “eleven thousand feet”). No plot amnesia; the memo, settlement absence, and poisoned families loop back as irreversible evidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The dome’s motorized slit and altitude-silence constrain her ritual—she turns the telescope away from stars toward the valley she damaged, a physical stance that charges the final image. Rosewood pen functions as micro-setting: its brass holder clicks, its ink pools, its history is handled twice, re-weighted when she relinquishes it to the mail shelf. Clouds below the catwalk act as literal barrier echoing the “second sea” of suppressed stories. Cold altitude air is tactile catalyst for the honesty she commits to paper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she break the Bellamy silence?—is signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs when Dao’s tremor converts abstract logbook into live risk; mailing the envelope forecloses retreat and exposes her family to liability. Cost is visible: the sealed letter, the valley lights she now must face, the forfeiture of her exile’s innocence. No coincidence; every escalation springs from her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse law of orbits: suppressed guilt always returns heavier. Subtext resides in handled objects—Dad’s nib, the logbook, the envelope—each shifting from heirloom to evidence. Final image of “truth descending toward a mailbox” reweights every prior silence without moralizing. Irony: the astronomer who mapped regret now becomes the projectile she once charted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise, archival, yet lyric: “ghostly repetition” of heel clicks, “particular silence of altitude,” mathematics that “never lied.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then snaps short—“Contradiction achieved.” No head-hopping; interior access is strictly Marguerite’s. Register stays within a scientist-heiress lexicon; metaphor is disciplined (“gravitational center of fear”). Final cadence mirrors telescope sweep—wide, then narrowing to the mailbox slot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory anchor, character state, thematic vector. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. “Clouds pooled below the catwalk like a second sea” condenses altitude, isolation, and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from long reflective loops to the staccato “Contradiction achieved.” Zero filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“groaned”, “flooded”, “scratched”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: astronomical method (proof by contradiction) weaponized against journalistic complicity. Rosewood pen transformed from paternal talisman into stylus of indictment; orbits recast as moral physics. Risk of didactic exposé avoided by keeping the spill off-stage—focus stays on epistemic guilt. Conceptual Repricing ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
