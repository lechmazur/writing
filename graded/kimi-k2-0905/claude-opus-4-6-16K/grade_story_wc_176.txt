<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Siv’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to re-enchant the world—are credibly braided through her fingers; the final whispered name is earned by the eleven-year thaw and the literal braid-by-braid labor. The “technically gentle” trait is more than label: it enables the rope-work and costs her cold-bitten joints. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak. Could push to 9+ if one earlier micro-choice had backfired and sharpened the risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope refracts the aurora into audible light, reweighting memory’s fragility into spectral permanence with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because she rebraids, therefore the sanctum answers—no lucky inserts. Orientation is nailed by word 80 (“glacier stairs into blue darkness”). One tightening beat suffices for this length; the stakes narrow from “preserve scrap” to “release names into light,” cost felt in her aching palms and the irrevocable alteration of sacred fibre.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice walls act as prismatic engine: their lattice angle is literally changed by her braid, turning setting into causative hardware. Aurora is not postcard but projector; rope is not prop but lens. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneel, glove removal, strand-over-strand—tracked without drift. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the rope-plinth constrains posture and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the names from erasure—is signaled in paragraph four and intensifies when the rope resists, narrowing options to “persist or surrender.” Agency is continuous: every crossing of fibre is a decision that risks ceremonial desecration. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt supplies counter-pressure. Cost is visible (cramping fingers, irrevocable alteration of relic) but could be sharper if one physical consequence carried past the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of “monuments to vanished originals” emerges through the lost-wax paradox and culminates when the rope becomes a monument to sound itself. No thesis lines; meaning accrues via braid, light, and the final unstruck bell of a whispered name. Ambiguity is fruitful: has she restored or overwritten the elders’ record? Emotional aftereffect is concrete—reader feels the aurora-green syllables settle like frost on the tongue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Siv’s perceptual bias: bronze dust, filament pressure, snowmelt ardor. Syntax lengthens and contracts with tactile focus; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within a caster’s lexicon without jargon spill. Aurora descriptions avoid cliché by functional integration. Voice is singular enough that replacing “she” with another caster would break cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors the braid-work: long strands of subordinate clauses, then tight knots of monosyllables (“She pressed her palm”). Figurative density is high but patterned—heat/melt/cold—teaching the reader by paragraph two. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffolding (“of age,” “into blue darkness”) keeps it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bronze-caster craft with phonetic archiving via rope-braiding feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Punched card → braid → light is a fresh semiotic chain; lost-wax ethos inverted—she preserves the negative space of sound. Risk taken: quiet climax where nothing explodes yet meaning refracts. No derivative echoes; could not swap “Kanallat” with any lost tribe without collapsing the organ-pitch logic.</comment>
