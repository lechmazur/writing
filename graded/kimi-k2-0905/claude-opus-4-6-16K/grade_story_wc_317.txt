<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s puzzle-designer mindset is rendered through tactile micro-choices (turning the seed, dialing the lock) that externalize her orthogonal thinking. The notebook note reframes her receptiveness as stewardship, not curiosity, giving the arc a visible cost: she now bears Bellweather’s legal risk. Interiority stays sensory and profession-specific, never drifting into label-speak. The only limit to 9-band is the absence of a second, contesting voice on stage to test her under status pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal spine is immaculate: numbered envelopes → combination → cabinet → notebook → new creative mandate; each beat narrows possibility while raising legal/ethical cost. Closure is a Decisive Change—she pivots from passive collector to active protector/innovator—paid for by the implicit lawsuit threat. The 7-3-1-4 rearrangement supplies the tightening required at this length. No orientation drift; mill, brook, and Room Three anchor instantly and reappear in the final image, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The converted mill beside the “perpetual, unhurried confession” of water is not backdrop; its darkness and isolation justify both her escape-room aesthetic and the covert deliveries. Micro-settings—the lantern-lit seed, the cold lock in Room Three—constrain her fingers and pacing, forcing precise, low-light actions that echo puzzle logic. The brook’s murmur resurfaces in the final “storm-born silence,” acoustically charging the Earned Stasis. One notch below 9 only because weather/light states could have been exploited one tick more to complicate the notebook reading.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake— protect radical bio-mechanical designs from corporate erasure—emerges with the notebook; escalation is the tightening discovery that she, not the sender, will incur legal heat if she proceeds. The turn is her deliberate choice to keep designing, accepting that cost. Orthogonal thinking is showcased but never externalized as an additional pressure source; hence not 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—creation demands the courage to shelter dangerous beauty—grows from the corpse-flower image (decade-long gestation, fethetic bloom) mirrored in Maren’s long-game design ethos. No moralizing; the notebook’s plea and her first sketch let the reader reweight prior seeds as slow-motion acts of rebellion. Ambiguity lingers: will she monetize or open-source the ideas? That uncertain tension is the resonance. No echo phrases, only plant-and-puzzle imagery that complicates rather than preaches.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter—sound of water, scent of peat, metallic chill of the lock—syntax tightening as realization lands (“storm-born silence filling the room like pressure”). Free-indirect modulation is seamless; no POV leakage or explanatory filler. Lexicon stays within her professional idiom (“cipher wheels,” “orthogonal approaches”), giving the prose a puzzle-maker’s cadence. Distinctive enough for 9-band despite no spoken dialogue to test voice split.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from brook-long cadences to staccato revelations (“It opened.”), propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in 800 words—both plant-death keyed and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops, zero filter-verb stacks; each line advances image, motive, or causality. Micro-copy flawless; punctuation around em-dashes and fragment beats is deliberate and clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Marrying escape-room logic to botanical automata is fresh, but the deeper risk is casting innovation itself as an act of legal defiance, not heroism—she may be inviting ruin. Corpse-flower payoff reconfigures a grotesque curiosity into an emblem of patient subversion. The orthogonal-design motif is shown, not named, throughout beats. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, meriting high-band originality.</comment>
