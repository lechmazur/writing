<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s chalk-artist past is evoked vividly, but the beat-level causality between that trait and her decision to draw through the mandala’s damage is asserted (“her old instinct”) rather than dramatized; the interior contradiction is present but thin. Embodied emotion is strong (palms, hush pressing on eardrums) and the final endurance costs her permanence, satisfying the arc. Social-perceptive label is used diagnostically once ("always unsettled people") without scene proof, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces permanence and keeps drawing while memory edges soften—cost is felt on-page. Causal chain holds: tile-flake hush → acoustic lure → chalk extension → acceptance of erasure. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves the ending, so waiver applies. One scaffold loop (“the mess within the order / the meaning within the mess”) repeats concept without new pressure, keeping it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto-acoustics, mist, and collapsing dome debris constrain every action: acoustics guide her chalk path, mist deepens with each line, tile flake’s hush is physically located. Micro-setting (curved iridescent shard) functions as pivot-object that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays biased to Maren’s painterly eye; no static catalogue. One clause of weather cliché (“mist curled like slow-dying breath”) is forgiven under lyric pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find meaning before city forgets—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the hush physically presses on her thoughts, forcing the choice to extend the mandala rather than preserve it. The escalation is accumulative/textural: each chalk line thickens the quiet and loosens her memories—cost is legible. No causal antagonist beyond environment, suitable for lens. Could hit 8.8+ if a sharper external consequence (e.g., memory loss of a specific name) surfaced on the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence vs. meaning emerges through sand, chalk, and dissolving archives rather than assertion. Final image of “almost naming” the recharged mess offers resonant ambiguity. Subtext in acoustic geometry translating grief is fresh. One soft echo of prompt language (“discover meaning in the mess”) appears mid-text; final paragraph avoids moralizing, preserving lift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains painterly perceptual signature—color, texture, acoustic space—without POV drift. Syntax flexes from long lyrical coils to fragmentary hush, matching rising quiet. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Sparse filter verbs are voice-motivated; one over-exact phrase (“emergent hush that built from silence the way a wave builds from stillness”) slightly overspills but pattern-taught, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control strong: sentence length modulates with breathing mist. Information density high—each sentence layers sense, emotion, world. One paraphrase loop adjacently repeats “the mess was all that remained / someone needed to read it,” deducting 0.2. Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic/water imagery; no mixed vehicles. Clean copy; only minor scaffold keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Concept of “citywide unlearning” paired with acoustic mandala graffiti is fresh; chalk-as-acceptance inverts vandalism trope. Whispers translated into color geometry provides non-obvious synthesis. Risk in quiet, almost plotless escalation pays off via charged poise ending. Near-echo of “slow-dying breath” cliché is the single hairline slip preventing 9+.</comment>
