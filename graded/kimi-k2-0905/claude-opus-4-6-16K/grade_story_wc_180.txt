<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s stubborn refusal and quiet revelation feel rooted in lived history; the silk-ribbon micro-choice shows embodied craft memory. Elsa’s feistiness is more label than crucible—no cost or contradiction emerges in her single on-page beat. Because the decisive turn depends on inherited papers Maren merely unpacks, agency crests at 8.3, not 9+. Still, the generational transfer lands with credible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “deciduous vow” reframes the fight from legal to hereditary, cost paid by the ruinous platform setting. Causal chain holds—patent breach → exile → forgotten pre-contract method discovered → decision to teach. Orientation is swift and spatially vivid; no lens ambiguity. One minor loop: the Syndicate’s off-stage confiscation resolves a problem it didn’t help create (−0.2).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is not backdrop but workbench: cracked marble steadies knees, rafter-apples supply honest light, pew-planks wobble under tool pressure. Every environmental detail is filtered through Maren’s quartz-eye precision; no sensory checklist. The setting actively constrains the polishing beat and recharges the final image of ripening fruit above reclaimed craft. Micro-setting (silk ribbon) likewise steadies the hand—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intellectual ownership vs. matrilineal right—tightens when the pre-patent diagram forecloses legal dependency. Escalation is a single deepening, not reversal, fitting Accumulative lens: density of heirloom knowledge reweights options. Cost is the cathedral exile itself, felt in absent loupes and splintered pews. Syndicate remains abstract, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of inherited knowledge as perennial growth emerges through grafted orchard imagery and the ribbon-to-diagram callback, never sermonized. Final “deciduous vow” line offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext in Elsa’s ribbon gift conveys alliance more than dialogue ever states. Minor abstraction in “bridge generational wisdom” tag keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s quartz-eye perception: light is “honest,” fracture lines “resolve.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during tool use—rhythmic control intact. Dialogue carries subtext (lawyer letter = compost). No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and charged in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; concrete nouns (“colloidal silver,” “bone-handled burnisher”) replace modifiers. No loops or scaffold; sentences stack jobs efficiently. One mixed metaphor—“ivy with ambitions”—is purposeful personification, not muddle. Line craft supports rather than decorates the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Patent-voided craftswoman hiding in tree-broken cathedral is fresh; orchard reclaiming nave supplies organic cyber-punk without gears. Pre-contract method in forgotten bag reframes familiar “lost knowledge” trope through tactile heirloom objects. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmick. Could edge 9+ with sharper external antagonist presence.</comment>
