<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and specific—‘the precise grammar of chemical reactions and the wild poetry…’—but she never makes a true micro-choice under pressure; the starling epiphany happens *to* her and the flame is executed with calm assurance. No contradictory impulse is enacted; sentimentality is asserted (‘pressed the notebook to her chest’) yet never complicates the final action. Closure feels observational rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—crystal → flame → stabilized spiral—but the decisive change (stabilization) lands without visible cost or irrevocable shift; the orchard still ‘held its breath,’ stakes deferred to tomorrow. Closure is lyrical poise, not Earned Stasis or CR with on-page price. Orientation clean by 120 words; transitions not needed in single-scene design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Waterfall’s shifting prism, pear bark breathing color, and crystal singing at dawn are tactile, POV-filtered, and causally active: the spectrum teaches the missing spiral. Spatial choreography is flawless—vial, dish, flame, notebook tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains the final calibration, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (save orchard or lose everything) is declared early and tightens when the starlings supply the missing variable; escalation is single-step, not iterative. Because success arrives the moment the crystal liquefies, pressure peaks and deflates in the same beat; no resource lost, tactic foreclosed, or price dramatized. Meets one-turn sufficiency for length but skirts the felt-cost threshold for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—wonder as ally, not enemy, of reason—emerges through fused imagery (spectrum + equation) rather than statement. Final sentence reweights earlier rejections by Academy/witches, achieving quiet CR. Avoids moralizing, but epiphanic phrasing (‘wonder was not the enemy…’) borders thesis; still earned by concrete act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—chemical grammar, starling wavelength, mineral spray—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for awe, clipped fragments (‘It sang’) at ignition. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; POV stable, distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is luminous yet disciplined: each image advances atmosphere or causality. Minor scaffold—‘the cascade threw prisms across every surface, painting… so that even the moss seemed…’—but it accelerates, not stalls. No mixed metaphors or loops in climax; high information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fuses alchemical science with lyric naturalism in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; starlings as oscilloscope is genuinely new. Risk is present—entire resolution hangs on bird pattern—but executed without gimmick. Could swap orchard for any hidden glade, so setting not irreplaceable, but conceptual marriage of spectrum and spiral is memorable.</comment>
