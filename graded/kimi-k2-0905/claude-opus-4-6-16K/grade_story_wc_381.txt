<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her nocturnal ritual, the tactile memory of the half-wing, the exhaustion that “empties” her—all embodied, never abstract. The solitary lens keeps pressure tight; her micro-choice to release the darkened wing is the earned renunciation that costs her the last of her summoned silences. No contradiction under stress; competence is balanced by the visible drain. The only cap is the lack of a second on-page character, so status crucible and relationship dynamics are N/A yet do not harm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the prophecy is conceptually repriced into lullaby, generals forget, the world “chooses peace,” and Elara’s isolation is simultaneously deepened and dissolved—cost is the spent silence she can never recall. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each silence layer arrives as texture, culminates in the brook’s bidirectional flow, and reweights the global stake without a causal reversal. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. One hairline slip: “the world’s murmuring had grown too loud” is slightly early shorthand before we see the prophecy syllables in the wild, but the later market/birdsong embedding retroactively justifies it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical move: it floats the wing, receives the layered silences, and carries them upstream/downstream—an impossible current that literalizes the textural logic. Meteor-pulp paper’s dual memory of soil/starlight is not decorative; it is the absorptive substrate that lets the wing complete itself by drinking the prophecy. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—moonlight eddies, paper hum between fingerpads, the cool specificity of cave-quiet—never tourist-catalog. Environment charges the final image: the darkened wing folding inward is the setting’s last gift, making the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy before its code sharpens into war”—is signaled in para 2 and escalates by Accumulative deepening: each pocket of silence narrows the prophecy’s communicative range until generals literally forget their orders. Agency is present throughout; Elara’s mapping and layering are the causal engine, no outside coincidence. Visible price: her exhaustion, the wing’s darkening, the irrevocable release. Could edge into 9+ if one mid-beat obstacle (e.g., a single resistant echo) had forced a tactical recalibration; instead the progression is a steady swell rather than a tightening pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: incompleteness as generative force—mother’s unfinished fold, the silence that completes the crane, the prophecy dissolved rather than answered. Subtext resides in gesture: releasing the wing is a quiet echo of letting the world remain unfinished and therefore safe. Final image reweights “incompleteness” from flaw to mercy, a Conceptual Repricing that feels earned rather than asserted. No moralizing, no thematic echo sentence; ambiguity lingers in the brook’s endless transit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual signature: moonlight “pooled in eddies,” silence arriving as “cool and specific” textures. Rhythm swells and subsides with the summoning—longer cadences for absorption, clipped fragments for the final release. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; diction stays within her arcane yet earthy lexicon. Compression (“terrestrially cosmic”) is taught early and paid off when the wing drinks both soil and starlight, keeping elision legible.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence moves image, stakes, or texture. One metaphor cluster in the “tranquil blaze” paragraph risks purple but is justified by the POV’s lyric register and pattern-taught payoff. Zero paraphrase loops, zero synonym churn. Closure line “the world… chose peace” is simple after the prior richness, giving a satisfying exhale without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The silence-as-substance conceit is fresh, yet anchored to lived tactile detail rather than abstract magic. Unfinished origami absorbing sound to complete itself is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of paperfold + meteor pulp + acoustic dampening. Risky lyric accumulation could have drowned causality, but the brook’s bidirectional flow literalizes the pattern without breaking plausibility. Transformation test fails if names are swapped—meteor paper and half-wing are irreplaceable—confirming genuine invention.</comment>
