<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation as “priest of silence” is embodied in pedal-work, pacing, and calibrated voice; Maren’s collapse into monochrome is dramatized through tremoring hand and palette. Interior contradiction registers cleanly: Elias needs the host to confess emptiness yet fears the answer; Maren’s “I assumed I was empty” is a credible endpoint. Cost is visible—Maren’s spectrum lost, Elias’s third silence loop broken—so Earned Stasis is felt. Minor slip: Elias’s biography is asserted not shown, holding this just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: each pedal layer removes one ontological floorboard until Maren’s self-definition buckles. Closure—“I assumed I was empty”—is a Decisive Change that reconfigures both identities and costs the red palette its last moisture. Anchor (who/where/when) is in by 90 words; dimensional rule-set stays consistent. Only the off-page history of the anchor keeps this from a 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salt-flat bunker is sketched in three strokes yet constrained: electromagnetic pylons and concrete walls limit sound and movement, forcing the silence-loop tactic. Palette and pedal serve as micro-setting, their tactile states altering choices (red dries under stress, pedal decides layer-count). Final image—cracked red dust—carries the reweighting. A hair more spatial tracking during the three pedal presses would secure 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep Maren from collapsing into single-frequency possession”—is signaled in first 120 words. Escalation is causal: each silence loop narrows her chromatic identity until only red remains; the rhetorical probe forces the final trade-off. Tightening beat is legible when palette cracks simultaneous with confession. Possession clock is mentioned but not used to alter tactics mid-scene, capping at 8.6.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of assumed interior emptiness emerges through chromatic attrition and acoustic void, never sermonized. Subtext pulses in palette state and pedal clicks; final cracked red revalues earlier “cathedral of pause.” Ambiguity survives: did Elias save Maren or merely trade one hollowing for another? No late thematic echo, so resonance is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s sensorium: loop-pedal under bare foot, taste of negative space, measured underwater diction. Syntax lengthens during pedal layers, then fractures at Maren’s smile-“with too many muscles,” mirroring dimensional stress. No head-hop; Maren’s interior is legible only through exterior tells—exactly the priest’s epistemic limit. Minor cadence repetition in rhetorical questions keeps this shy of 9.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image plus causal push (“recording silence... captured and layered back upon itself”). Figurative language is sparse, peaks at “rope coming undone strand by strand,” then recedes, avoiding density bleed. No paraphrase loops; pedal actions are varied (“pressed,” “triggered,” “lifted”). One clause ambiguity: “sound like the world exhaling” is slightly mixed metaphor, tapping the score down from 8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Possession-via-chromatic-collapse and silence-as-architecture feel novel yet inevitable; the pedal becomes a theological instrument rather than a sci-fi gadget. Red palette drying into monolith refigures standard demon-exorcism into phenomenological surgery. Risk—entire climax is a conversation—pays off because the silence loops provide visceral stakes. Specificity prevents trope recycling: this could not swap palettes with another story.</comment>
