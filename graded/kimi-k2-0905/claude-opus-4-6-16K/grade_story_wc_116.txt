<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper’s discipline of witnessing without judgment is vividly dramatized through her bare-hands burrowing, translucent swan navigation, and ultimate renunciation of record-keeping; still, her interior contradiction is articulated only once (“she preferred them that way”) and the final stance-shift, while poetically charged, is not visibly paid for by a prior micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path—so the cost is felt atmospherically rather than tactically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates texture of decay and silence until the obsidian chamber reweights the stake; the final image—“she wrote nothing”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible (record-keeping vs. letting silence keep itself) and carries conceptual cost; orientation is deliberately disorienting but taught early and paid off at closure, so waiver applies; one meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The origami swan operates as micro-setting that literally re-architects the catacombs; the obsidian refuge charges the final image by mirroring the keeper’s own translucence; every sensory detail (mineral tears, mossy spines, black water) is filtered through her loosened-reality bias and guides her final renunciation—environment constrains choice and reweights meaning at close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake = preserving detachment vs. surrendering to regenerative silence; pressure tightens when each fold of the swan erodes her archival agency; the final renunciation narrows options (she writes nothing) and carries atmospheric cost, but the escalation is more lyrical accumulation than causal reversal, so cost is legible yet oblique rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active regenerative force rather than absence; the final image of “sediment of whatever would grow next” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; earlier motif of composted names returns reweighted, satisfying the 9+ test; could edge higher if conceptual cost were sharper on-page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable: syntax elongates and compresses with damp-air cadence; diction favors tactile, mineral, vegetal nouns; free indirect style stays consistent; no head-hopping; perceptual signature (“gripped reality loosely”) recurs as rhythmic pulse; minor tightening would remove two adjectival clauses, but rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rich figurative density risks purple overload yet pattern is taught early (“roots threaded through spines”) and pays off; no mixed metaphors; no loops; high information density per sentence; final paragraph slows syntax to mirror river-time, propelling closure—only a single paraphrase loop (“silence…silence…silence”) docks fractional point.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses archive-horror with ecological regeneration; origami-as-architecture feels fresh and inevitable; trope of underground library is subverted by silence-as-river; thematic synthesis of decay → growth is non-obvious; risk-taking (no antagonist, lyrical structure) heightens meaning without clarity loss; specificity of volcanic-glass chamber anchors originality.</comment>
