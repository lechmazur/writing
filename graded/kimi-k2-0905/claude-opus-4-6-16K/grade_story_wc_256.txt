<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—her obsession with perfect sonic fidelity versus her hunger for human connection—are dramatized in the bell-striking beats, but the interiority flirts with diagnostic label-speak (“the texture of connection is not a frequency”). The final renunciation is earned because every failed bell strike visibly costs her time and certainty; the lens-handling micro-choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she stops reconstructing and starts answering, foreclosing the laboratory’s archival premise with the felt cost of surrendering her life’s craft. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bell attempt thickens the pattern until the carbide-lamp reweighting breaks it. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: its concave glass literally reframes the sound she hears and finally focuses the golden shadow that charges the closing image. Laboratory details are selective—electromagnetic locks, monitor glow—guiding her access without museum tour excess. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to ear to switch-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed overtone; the final bell is not to match but to answer, narrowing her options from archival fidelity to relational risk. Cost is visible: she abandons the tuning hammer and accepts an unquantifiable silence. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bell-vs-listening opposition; no explicit thesis is stated. The lamp’s shift from talisman to listening vessel reweights prior material without moralizing. Final silence is Conceptually Repriced: loss becomes living texture. Minor deduction for the phrase “artificial pilgrimage” that lightly_echoes_ the prompt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature—smoke-darkened glass, spectral harmonics—without filter-verb leakage. Syntax modulates from precise technical nouns to lyrical spirals mirroring her accelerating intuition. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses intentionally under revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Metaphors (golden shadows, prism-song) recur with shifting denotation that charges closure. Rhythm accelerates through shorter clauses as revelation hits, then exhales into the final long sentence. No mixed vehicles or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Extinct frequencies reconstructed by crystal bells” is fresh; pairing it with a miner’s lamp as listening device transforms both artifacts. The pilgrim frame is inverted—revelation found by surrendering the quest. Specific grand-fathered lens and Andalusian wind prevent generic swap-out; risk is coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
