<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—scholar who harvests others’ lore yet surrendered her own—is dramatized in the barefoot re-entry to the ring; the micro-choice to step back inside at the precise angle externalizes her need to repossess identity. The embodied cost (cold water, mushroom scent, forty years lost) is visceral, and the laughter-through-tears beat shows irreconcilable grief/relief without diagnostic label-speak. One slip: “she understood then, not with logic…” edges toward epiphany-speak; tightening that line would push the score into the 9s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty notebook is finally filled, a decisive change legible in the last sentence. Causal chain holds—blank journal → return to greenhouse → star-map decryption → ring re-entry → memory restitution—each step narrows options and exacts the price of confronting stolen time. The piece meets mosaic Track B: four shards (kitchen, coast road, greenhouse night, dawn) taught by 25 %, transitions legible, lens (Accumulative/Textural) coherent at the charged-poise ending. Only a whisper of orientation lag in the first 120 words keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-body metaphor (iron ribs, drowned ribcage) and saltwater ankle-deep constrain every motion; the broken star-panes literally guide Maren’s footing toward the ring, so environment shapes tactics. The etched constellations function as both tool and map, recharging the final image when she aligns her stance to the north-northwest prow. Sensory selection stays under folklorist bias—she notes threshold markings, charm scents, apple and woodsmoke spores—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate: car → gravel → ankle-deep water → ring center → star-view, no impossible drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover embezzled memories—signals early via the blank notebook; pressure tightens when star deviations converge on the fairy ring, foreclosing retreat. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the sky-chart, doffs shoes, steps at the angle dictated, pays the cold-water price. Cost is visible (shuddering dawn barefoot, forty years of lost songs flooding back) and alters stance—she now writes her own lore first. One beat more showing bodily toll post-return would secure the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the scholar who commodifies culture must repatriate her own erased narrative before she can ethically catalogue others. The fairy ring’s memory-theft reweights folklore from quaint data to living, potentially predatory exchange—an insight earned through physical risk rather than thesis statement. Final image of ink finally meeting paper offers resonant, non-moral answer: stewardship starts at the self. No thematic echo or moralizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Maren’s perceptual filter—root-pattern tracing, star-chart trigonometry, scent of Marasmius oreades—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“constellations were wrong. Broken.”) then fractures into short beats to mimic memory-rain return. Prose rhythms echo her profession: catalogic precision folded into lyric surge. Voice remains distinct and controlled at peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “saltwater covered the tile floor to her ankles… apple trees, impossibly alive” does world-building, stakes, and wonder in two lines. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “iron ribs rose like the ribcage of something drowned” is singular and coherent. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. One minor filter-stack (“seemed to inhale”) slightly dulls the final beat—tighten to breach 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fairy-ring-as-memory-leech is fresh, but making the victim a folklorist who literally empties her own field notebook transforms trope into urgent personal stakes. Synthesis of Victorian greenhouse, wreck-ringed marsh, and hand-etched celestial key feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky structural choice—four time-shards—heightens the accumulative return of memory without gimmickry. If the Cornwall folklore snippets had carried one untranslatable refrain resurfaced at the end, inevitability would be perfect; as is, still publish-now level ingenuity.</comment>
