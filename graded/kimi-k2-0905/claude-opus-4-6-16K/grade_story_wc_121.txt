<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s gravity-defiance is shown through hereto-fore-unseen embodied beats (floating above bed, above viaduct) that externalize an interior fracture; the tablet-triggered swim that ends her lifelong rising is a tangible renunciation with felt weight-cost, earning her “sentence” line. Interiority is lyrically concrete (“weight fully her own”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The periodically eternal trait stays observational, never biting a choice, so agency is slightly abstract; still, the final grounded stance lands as earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration: the blank tablet + first-ever swim crystallize cost; “labyrinth folded inward” reweights all prior floating. Causal chain is lyric (tablet → runes → skin → swim) but legible; the Orientation Test is met by ~50 words. One micro-turn suffices; no off-stage resolution. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—image pattern of rise/fall reweights stakes—and holds to last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent viaduct and post-rain canal are sensory engines (electric green blaze, still ripple) that constrain the timing of her tablet activation; water surface becomes the final rebirth threshold, hence charges final image. Spatial choreography is clean—drop → ripple → swim. World rules stay consistent; no exposition clog. Meets 9+ gate: setting (water) shapes the decisive tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: reconcile or refuse her anti-gravity fracture; signaled in para-1. Pressure deepens via procedural maze forcing confrontation with every timeline variant; final swim is visible cost foreclosing the floating path. Escalation is textured (image density of timelines narrowing) not causal-rational, fitting Accumulative lens. Legible price paid on page; no coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—self as iterative labyrinth—emerges through image pattern (rise/fall, drop/ripple) rather than statement; final grounded stance offers non-literal answer. Subtext resides in body-physics: gravity equals belonging. No late moralizing; “sentence” line is character-true. Ambiguity lingers (is blank tablet freedom or void?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, rhythmic, slightly mythic (“periodically eternal”) but consistent; perceptual signature favors luminous liquid imagery that mirrors Maren’s aerial detachment. No dialogue to judge. Tense stable; free-indirect clean. Minimal scaffold; some elevated diction (“procedural generation,” “conceptual repricing”) is allowed by mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful clause variation; sentences layer image + motion (“rainwater trace luminous paths”). No loops or paraphrase detected. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth = veins) and do not crowd beats. High density achieved; final line is crisp. Occasional stacked modifiers (“electric green in the wet darkness”) are stylistic not cluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anti-gravity as metaphor for ontological fracture + procedural maze via clay tablet is non-obvious and internally coherent. Risky lyric structure pays off in earned grounded image. Concept commits fully; no retreat to magic fix. Specific detail (blank clay at end) inverts expectation of power-object. Transformation test passes—swap names and core idea collapses.</comment>
