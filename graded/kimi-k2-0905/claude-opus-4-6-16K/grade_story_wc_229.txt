<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—palms to stone, breath above seawater—and her endurance-of-humility motive stays legible across beats. The micro-choice to anoint the lens with three drops crystallizes her hierarchy of values, while the renunciation of ever claiming “keeper” is foreclosed with felt cost. Donal’s off-stage pivot is causally linked but not embodied on page, so the full weight of cost lands only on Maren’s solitude, slightly narrowing the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the “vibration” motif and scent build density until the beam fracture reweights the lighthouse’s purpose. Orientation is anchored at once; the closing image of Donal choosing to return supplies the Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost—lives silently saved. No slips touch the closure; the whispers’ cost is the keeper’s permanent anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tower, night-blooming cereus, and pre-dawn copper sky are filtered through Maren’s vocational gaze, constraining her ritual and charging the lens. The jasmine scent is returned at the climax to signal weather’s turn and emotional cleansing. Spatial choreography is flawless; every stair and drop is tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers save—tightens when the purified seawater is deployed; the beam’s soft fracture visibly narrows options: repel vs beckon. The cost is Maren’s perpetual invisibility; escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but pressure is coherent under the lens. Donal’s rescue is heard second-hand, muting the price’s visceral punch by a hair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of warning into welcome; no abstract thesis is stated. Final image of “the whisper carried” reweights every prior vibration without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—no one thanks Maren—and that omission is the earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren’s perceptions; sensory diction (“cobalt glow like something not entirely real”) is character-bound. Rhythm modulates with long breath-like clauses pre-dawn, then shortens during the drop ritual. No head-hopping; Donal’s paragraph is still filtered through observable externals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers scent, color, and metaphysics. Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors in the climax beat. Minor scaffold: “the way she felt everything—as a vibration” is slightly self-paraphrased, but it teaches the pattern that later pays off. Read-aloud rhythm is natural; paragraph cuts land on image beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-as-whisper concept freshens the familiar sentinel trope; the seawater vial’s slow “purification by attention” is a specific, non-obvious device. Risk is quiet—no plot twist—yet coherence is high. Could only be this keeper, this tower, this dawn.</comment>
