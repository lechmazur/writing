<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient copyist vs. clandestine decoder—drives every micro-choice; the final fold-and-hide beat crystallizes her renunciation with ink-under-nail cost. Motivation stays particular and embodied; no stock phrases. The “teach dust to tell stories” creed is dramatized, not declared, and her pulse change is on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the folded strip in the coat lining reweights silence itself, cost is unmistakable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of listening→transcribing→smuggling tightens once, then crystallizes. No orientation debt; ember alcove, night, and radio dial anchored by word 82. Causality intact: because each broadcast ends, therefore her archive grows, therefore the city’s skin will itch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sandstone-mist-rust triad constrains visibility and hides her green dial glow; the micro-setting (bench, hearth, coat lining) supplies the tactical pockets she needs. Sensory hierarchy is copyist-precise: ink iron, ember tick, static crackle. Final image of “thistled silence” reuses mist and dust, now charged with smuggled meaning—meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep stories alive—tightens once when she moves from passive listening to active encoding; the folded page forecloses her safety. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each captured melody increases cumulative risk without external contrivance. Cost is visible in the hidden pocket beat; would enter 8.8+ with a persistent constraint shown shaping next-night tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: transcription as resurrection of erased voices. The dust motif shifts from passive witness to co-conspirator without authorial nudge. Final “dust was already listening” offers Conceptual Repricing—silence itself is now complicit—no moralizing. Subtext in lullaby-as-archive is deft; ambiguity lingers about who else is listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is copyist-centric: frequencies measured in cello-part margins, time felt in ink-drying breaths. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for mist pooling, staccato fragments when dial catches signal. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens cleanly to the pen-touch-paper beat. Compression (“preservation was waiting with better posture”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“green glow was the only light she trusted” does double duty as visibility and trust metric. One mixed metaphor (“silence felt thistled”) but it’s intentional, pattern-taught, and charges closure. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: orchestral copyist + pirate shortwave + dust-as-archive feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test fails—plot could not survive swapping her profession. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. One hairline slip: “country that no longer appeared on any map” skirts cliché, but the encoded-song mechanic refreshes it.</comment>
