<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is richly particular—her glass-trained eye, her belief that “a window was never just a window,” her embodied grief over Lise. The causal chain from daughter’s departure → stone-thrown ripples → readiness to listen is clear, and the final renunciation (she will not ask Lise to stay) costs her the fantasy of easy repair. Micro-choices—picking up, weighing, releasing each stone—externalize the hierarchy of values under pressure. Only the “reads between lines” trait is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, a minor label-slip keeping this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each stone’s ripples intensify the dominant stake—how to meet the daughter who already left—until the final charged poise where Maren lets the last stone fall, reconfiguring her stance. Closure lands with unmistakable cost: she forecloses the persuasive/protective path and accepts the pain of mere listening. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only hairline slip is a single sentence of overt thesis (“This was her motivation…”) that slightly precedes the final image instead of letting the image alone reprice the concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pearl Bay’s pre-dawn luminescence, the breathing prism atrium, the glass-smooth water constraining how ripples propagate—all are filtered through a glazier’s sensory hierarchy and directly charge the final image. The mist-filled atrium acts as micro-setting/tool that refracts the first true sun onto the water at the exact beat when Maren releases her last stone, a literal environmental constraint that times her decision. Occupational detail (silica, kiln, noctilucent clouds) is accurate, selective, and woven through action rather than expository dump. One tiny spatial float: the distance between water’s edge and ferry dock is unspecified, but it never affects tactics, so waived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to face the returning daughter without repeating the earlier fracture—is signaled early and tightens through each stone-thrown widening: the rings literalize the irreversible spread of Lise’s departure. The meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes the hour of reckoning is passing into “plain day,” translating abstract anticipation into a concrete temporal limit that forces her final stance crystallization. Cost is legible: she gives up the hope of fixing or explaining, accepting instead the vulnerability of mere listening. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the pressure accretes rather than pivots, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of the mundane is illuminated not by argument but by the glazier’s refractive attention to ripples, glass, and light. Subtext operates in the silence between mother and daughter (never on-page) and in the metaphorical transference of “stress living in the spaces between visible cracks.” The final image of the last stone’s luminous rings offers a resonant, non-literal answer—proof that even the smallest gesture disturbs the whole world—without moralizing. No mixed metaphors or abstract slogans; the conceptual repricing is performed, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—light through facets, kiln thresholds, noctilucent clouds—creating a distinct syntactic shimmer (“the water still held that strange luminescence—neither moonlight nor dawn…”). No dialogue appears, so no voice contamination. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from wide-shot bay to the palm-weighed stone to interior decree. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated; diction never drifts above the glazier’s plausible lexicon. One clause (“the grammar of consequence”) flirted with abstraction, but the next sentence grounds it in tactile rings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: long breathing sentences mirror the mist, then crisp fragments (“She threw another stone.”) punch the beat. Figurative density is high yet patterned—light, glass, rings—paying off in the closure image without muddle. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor scaffold: “each diminishment was also a widening” is a near-restate, but it compresses the paradox succinctly and is immediately followed by sensory proof, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The harbor-glazier-uses-ripples-to-commune trope is fresh; the synthesis of craft knowledge, maternal grief, and noctilucent dawn feels specific rather than checklist. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-confrontational ending—no ferry-scene melodrama—which heightens coherence but slightly lowers surface novelty. One soft echo of “stone-into-water” as universal metaphor is inevitable; the text particularizes it through glass physics and kiln timing. Overall, a memorable inflection rather than a revolutionary premise.</comment>
