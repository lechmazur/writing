<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradiction—face-blind portraitist—drives every beat: the ribbon is handled, the sketches are choices, the final call is hers. Interiority stays concrete (“texture and gesture,” “ridge of callus”). The “awaken empathy” motive is declared late and abstractly, blunting cost; no on-page micro-choice shows her paying for that empathy. Still, her methodical nature visibly constrains descent, breathing, drawing, and the climactic identification.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is clean: ribbon → sketches → hand ID → phone call → case reopened. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: she descends alone, climbs out having traded anonymity for exposure (“something had cleared”). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One minor teleport: the ribbon is “sealed in an evidence bag” that materializes without prior mention, but it does not break the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Quarry mist, drill scars, and satchel tools are filtered through tactile POV; the granite wall literally shadows her easel and dictates where mist thins enough to draw. The ribbon’s stiffness and fray return twice, each time guiding next action. Final image—“mist thickened…something had cleared”—reweights the setting from oppressive to catalytic. No environmental detail is decorative; each constrains movement or visibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: resurrect a cold case before bureaucratic indifference re-buries it. Pressure tightens once: from static sketches to positive ID that forecloses anonymity for both Maret and Maren. Cost is legible—she exits the quarry exposed, no longer invisible to the system she defies. No second reversal, but the single escalation is meaningful and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—sight vs. recognition, empathy vs. evidence—emerges through the ribbon-to-sketch progression rather than thesis statements. The only echo risk is the final “awaken dormant empathy” sentence, but it is brief and offset by the preceding image of literal clearing mist. Subtext of complicity (she profits from faces she cannot keep) stays implicit. Resonance lands via the reconfigured quarry light, not moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Maren’s tactile bias: “catalogued the world through texture,” “ridge of callus,” “stiffness of dried adhesive.” Syntax lengthens during sketching, shortens in the call—“I have enough to reopen it”—mirroring pulse. No head-hop, no filter-stack. Dialogue is one line, goal-driven, subtextual. Voice remains distinct under pressure; quarry acoustics and mist are sensed, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and accurate: “mist pooled…like something alive” is the single simile, taught early and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor scaffolding: “she began to draw” could be cut, but it occupies only three words and does not stall momentum. Clean grammar, precise nouns, no synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Face-blind sketch-artist as forensic witness is fresh; the quarry-as-darkroom literalizes “negative space.” Fencing callus and masquerade ribbon transform familiar gala-murder tropes into tactile clues. The story could not swap the ribbon for a button or the quarry for a forest without breaking its logic. Risk is moderate—lyric compression inside a crime frame—but coherence never wavers.</comment>
