<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her father’s gauge tooth becomes an extension of her hand, not a symbol explained to us. The contradiction between meticulous preparation and naked faith is held in scene, not label. The final gesture—planting jasmine in the same pot—renounces nothing yet costs everything she’s hoarded: certainty. Only the rose-less silence keeps this from 9.0; the earned stasis is legible but fractionally under-felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each mirrored shard—petal fall, gauge tooth scraping roots, rowboat rhythm—layers density until the final image reweights “gardening” as urban defiance. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cutting trembles, options narrowed to grow-or-don’t, with the harbor’s mercury glare as undeniable conceptual cost. No causal turn is required; the hush itself is the repricing. The moment the moonlight sheets upward, the before/after toggle locks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fire-escape iron, cracked terra-cotta, aluminum cans—each object is handled, not catalogued, constraining her reach and drainage choices. The harbor’s moonlight is not backdrop but working light she weaponizes with mirrors. The gauge tooth’s micro-setting (a locksmith’s fingertip scale) charges the final planting beat. Missing only a tactile return of the alley’s needles to hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can reflected beauty survive systemic precarity? Pressure tightens when the last petal drops—her eleven-year proof of survival ends. Escalation is textural: each scrape of root against steel, each mirror hung, accumulates until planting the stolen cutting becomes the visible price. Cost is legible; the pot now holds contraband, not memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the slow shift of “measure twice, cut once” to “plant anyway.” Light-as-defiance is never moralized; the final image lets the jasmine cutting tremble between promise and eviction. Subtext lives in the silence after the petal falls—an urban form of grace. The refusal to name the landlord or fire marshal keeps ambiguity charged.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s locksmith-trained eye: noticing latches, wards, grates. Syntax lengthens and softens under moonlight, then tightens to staccato during scraping—rhythm mirrors oars without announcing the trope. No head-hopping; even the rowboat is only surface motion, not interior. Voice resists lyric purple because diction stays within a mechanic’s daughter’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; paragraph breath matches eye-movement down the fire escape. No filter-verb stacks; “she watched” is earned once, not looped. Metaphors (mercury, cathedral balcony) are few, precise, and paid off in the gleam of the final image. One near-loop: “pull, lift, return” could trim to two beats, but it mimics oar-lock sound, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-botanist synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; no existing trope covers “rose gardener as lock-picker of sky-light.” stealing a botanical-cutting replaces the expected key-duplication, transforming heritage tool into garden trowel. Risk is taken: a quiet ending in a stolen jasmine twig, not a confrontation with landlord. Specificity of harbor district alleys prevents generic anywhere-setting.</comment>
