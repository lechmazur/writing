<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s internal contradiction—“grim optimist”—is palpable in every beat: she keeps climbing while naming futility, writes proofs of entrapment, and still chooses the next step. The dice and chalk are micro-choices that externalize her hierarchy of values; the blank die is the embodied cost. No other character shares the scene, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Earned Stasis closure is fully motivated: she pays with her infinite climb to buy the single step into stillness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ascent, proof, chalk, die rolls that incrementally reweight the stake of infinite vs. finite. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“infinite staircase”), stakes by word 50; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the blank-die rupture collapses the helix and crystallizes a new stance—“quiet on the other side of forever”—with undeniable conceptual cost (she forfeits the climb that defined her). Causality keeps: chipped die → zero → proof completion → architecture folds; no teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The staircase is not backdrop but constraint-generator: each landing supplies chalk and stone canvas, the chipped die literally alters probability, the zero-face rewrites world-rules mid-scene. Spatial choreography is clean—steps fold “like pages” from bottom up while landings “rush together” from above. Selective sensory hierarchy: only pale light, chalk dust, stone temperature; no tourist catalog. Micro-setting (die, chalk) constrains tactics and charges the final image—she pockets the warm dice and steps into stillness—satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus infinite imprisonment—signaled in paragraph 1; tightens when the incomplete proof offers rupture, crystallizes with the zero-die roll. Single meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens: density of carved equations increases until the blank face breaks pattern and reweights cost from “climb forever” to “forfeit the climb.” Agency is continuous—each chalk line, each roll advances tactic. No coincidence; the die she stole is the same die that finally lands zero. Price is visceral: she loses the only world she knows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme—hope as both affliction and engine—emerges from particulars: dice favoring “outcomes that shouldn’t exist,” proofs arguing boundless confinement, the blank face that makes escape real. No thesis stated; final line (“A grim optimist never does”) is image, not moral. Conceptual Repricing reweights “forever” from curse to threshold; the quiet she buys is felt cost, not explained. Ambiguity lingers: is stillness death or transcendence? Resonance arises from concrete objects (chipped die, chalk) rather than abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited interiority stays strictly Maren-bound; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—“equations carved like graffiti,” “texture of the moment”—syntax mirrors recursive climb via anaphora and balanced clauses. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Diction remains within lexicon of a former physics student; no register drift. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: long reflective sentences give way to staccato “She rolled… zero.” Unreliability is subtle—she misbelieves escape requires continuity until discontinuity proves true; revealed through event, not retro explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rhythm modulates with ascent: early languid clauses mimic endless climb, final section short beats mimic collapse. Figurative language is sparse and taught—“pages of a book being closed”—never clutters closure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or causality. Strong verbs (fold, compress, reconstitute) replace modifiers. Tense stable; pronoun references clean. The one mixed metaphor—“architecture shuddered”—is minor, does not touch closure, so −0.2 only. Line-level artifacts never obscure cause-effect or dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Infinite staircase + mathematical proof + loaded die synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; no template plot matches this mechanics-of-infinity angle. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—stake is embedded in topology of perpetual motion. Risky structural compression (entire infinity collapsed into one step) is executed without clarity loss. Specific detail—chipped corner where six meets five—creates memorable object. Conceptual integrity absolute: story commits to self-sustaining ascent, follows implication to blank-face rupture, no retreat to metaphorical safety.</comment>
