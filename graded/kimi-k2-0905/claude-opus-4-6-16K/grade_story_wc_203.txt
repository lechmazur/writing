<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marco’s vocational gaze, practiced aloofness from the dead, and climactic decision to “engage” all track cleanly. The micro-choice to pocket the locket for Marguerite shows cost and continuity. Internal contradiction (pragmatist vs. reluctant medium) stays implicit but active. One hairline slip: “he had learned that watching back accomplished nothing” tells a competence rather than dramatizes the wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: ceiling crack → hidden barrel → ghost’s release; each because/therefore link is on-page. Closure is Earned Stasis: Marco accepts the unfinished job and the new debt of delivery, costing professional detachment. The locket in his pocket is a persistent constraint that will shape future tactics. No causal breaks; spatial and temporal anchors land by word 120.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fluorescent hum, warped boards, dust-on-plaster diagnostics, and the engraved elephant march create tactile specificity without catalog bloat. The ceiling as “honest part of buildings” functions as micro-setting that literally guides choice. Environment constrains the barrel’s placement and the ghost’s sightline. One minor inelegance: “light that wasn’t there” edges toward cliché, but the locket glint redeploys the motif at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep his professional equilibrium while the dead watch. The tightening occurs when the ghost finally looks back—his rule of non-engagement collapses. Price is immediate: he pockets responsibility and delays the county schedule. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word frame; agency stays with Marco throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hidden flaw in structures (ceilings, people) emerges through action, not lecture. Subtext of custodial guilt—maintenance men inherit buried sins—lingers after the ghost’s release. Final image of the still-buzzing lights reweights the premise: the living keep the circuit closed. No moralizing; resonance is felt via the locket’s unexplained chain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marco’s tool-centric, crack-reading gaze. Syntax is clipped, nouns specific (“mainspring barrel,” “sequined leotard”), rhythm mirrors the flashlight sweep. No head-hop; ghost perception remains externalized. One micro drift: “weightless burden” edges toward authorial lyric, but the POV recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences advance on dual tracks—physical inspection + metaphysical stakes—without paraphrase loops. Variation in sentence length mimics the fluorescent flicker. No mixed metaphors; “dust gathered thick and even” is concrete. Minor scaffold: “he turned it in his hands” could compress, but it does not stall the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seer elevator mechanic is fresh hook; pairing it with horological circus relic deepens idiosyncrasy. Dust forensics as ghost-busting tool reverses genre expectation. Risk of sentimentality is sidestepped by Marco’s refusal of melodrama. Could edge higher if Marguerite’s future search carried a planted obstacle here.</comment>
