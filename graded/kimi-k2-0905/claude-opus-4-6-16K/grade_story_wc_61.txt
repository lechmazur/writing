<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elu’s crystal-bones grief and “share light without fire” motive are vivid; the gear bite into her sternum embodies cost. Yet the beat never escalates choice—she already knows the pattern, so the final ping is only execution, not renunciation or gamble. Interior contradiction registers, but the absence of a live second option caps emotional scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens declared early (“measured across the quiet sigh”) and held; closure is Charged Poise—signal leaves, gear floats, Elu endures. Pattern teaches itself by 25 %, shards cohere. The cost is legible in the sternum wound and the unbroken pattern she refuses to abandon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Nebula Garden plasma petals act as both transmitter and moral exemplar; their cold luminance literally powers the climactic ping. Spatial choreography never drifts—gear, petal, Elu’s sternum keep orienting the camera. The setting’s magnetic bioluminescence reweights the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“offer the next species a different inheritance”—is clear; tightening occurs when Terenian dread is braided into the ping, foreclosing the option to stay silent. Cost is present but second-hand (extinct races), muting visceral pressure. One meaningful intensification meets scope, yet no live opposition keeps it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of breaking cyclical self-immolation while still choosing to testify. The gear-to-sternum image reconfigures the reader’s sense of love’s weight without moralizing. Final pulse to the child offers resonant ambiguity: pattern says no, sentimentalist says maybe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, taught immediately (“petals here were not petals”) and sustained: plasma exhalations, gravitational pings. Perceptual signature stays crystalline and slow-time; compression like “approximating infinity” reads as Elu’s native idiom. No filter stacks or register drift; closure line lands with rhythmic certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable—ionized gas, computational engines, magnetic fields woven without stall. One paraphrase loop (“every civilization…burning something” echoed twice) slightly dulls mid-section momentum. Otherwise varied sentence cadence and zero mixed metaphors; closure image remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Remembrancers, cold-light nebula gardening, and grief-encoded sonar synthesize into a singular cosmic pastoral. Premise flips the usual “warn them or not” into “warn them knowing they’ll ignore,” a fresh angle on Cassandra. Risky lyric pacing is taught early and paid off, justifying high-band entry.</comment>
