<comment>Seraphane’s resolve is cleanly rooted in the opening exile beat; her micro-choice to dissolve the heirloom moonstone into ink binds emotional cost to tactic. Dorin’s stillness under the needle shows embodied courage without label-speak. The final “anchor” moment crystallizes her shift from fugitive to founder, paying the loneliness price on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s sudden ontological solidity and Dorin walking out with a living sky re-weight the stake—exile becomes foundation. Causal chain holds: because she kept the dust, therefore she can ink memories, therefore the garden roots itself. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Lens is Causal; final image reconfigures option space with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting: the surveillance gap explicitly allows the illegal tattoo ritual, constraining timing and method. Star-map choreography is spatially tracked; Dorin’s muscle-constellations evolve as he moves. Sensory economy favors scent of illegal roses and bone-black ink viscosity—details tied to the act, not tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen memory—tightens when Dorin offers his blank back; the needle becomes the last open port. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each star inscribed narrows future forgetting to zero, visible cost in Dorin’s flinch and Seraphane’s drained vial. Agency stays causal; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges sans sermon: memory as subversive astronomy—skin becomes sky, outlawing erasure. Final image of fisherman carrying “living sky” re-prices the regime’s power—no law can police epidermal galaxies. Subtext of tide-dancer turned star-scribe links water and cosmos, reinforcing exile as creative genesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains stable, rhythmic, tide-pulled cadence matches former dancer perception. Diction—“syllables move between silences,” “obsidian grace”—stays within poet-fugitive lexicon. No head-hop; sensory filter consistent: night air, ink scent, needle tug filtered through her kinetic memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates—long fluid clauses for tide memory, staccato for needle work. Information-dense: single sentence delivers ink recipe, maternal relic, and cosmic intent without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-ink-astronomy on skin feels inevitable yet unwritten elsewhere. Risk of lyric cosmic verse pays off—emotional specificity of cracked moonstone dust overrides gimmick. Twilight garden as resistance cell and body as palimpsest sky reframe exile into genesis.</comment>
