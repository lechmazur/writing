<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s obsession is visceral—eleven counted years of muteness, “symphonically minded” interior noise, and tactile micro-choices (mapping cracks with calipers, positioning porcelain) make her refusal to quit credible. The lone flaw: we’re told madness but never shown a beat where it endangers a choice, so cost stays conceptual not embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: silence → audible tone, paid for by hours of bleeding fingertips. Causal chain holds: crack-map → inverse-carved alder → porcelain node → widening sound ring. Orientation beats the 120-word anchor; only nitpick is a mild lens wobble (accumulative texture early, then causal) but it fuses by climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Valley muteness, minerited sculpture, hedgehog hibernation, porcelain telegraph salvage—all concrete, POV-filtered, and instrumental. Alder grove constrains method (wood choice, crack pattern) and charges the final image (sound finally reaches its edge). No orientation debt; spatial clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—tightens through iterative trials; each failed strum forecloses another design option until the porcelain node succeeds. Cost is present (time, bleeding fingers, exhaustion) but compressed into summary; a single dramatized sacrifice moment would lift it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as inverse mapping of trauma, resonance reclaimed through fracture. The hairline-silk tone that widens beat by beat reweights the earlier statue’s “last scream” into living birdsong; no moralizing, pure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Maren’s carpenter-ear: “stress cracks branched along outstretched fingers,” “sap through heartwood.” Rhythm swells with interior symphony, thins to single-sentence paragraphs for climax; no POV leakage, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; figurative language sparse and purposeful. Only micro-loop: “strummed again … strummed a third time” template—minor, outside final third. Strong verbs carry density; no mixed metaphors or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Concept of “tree-song sculptor who reads silent stress cracks to compose anti-sound” is fresh; stakes invert standard apocalypse trope (absence rather than excess). Hedgehog and porcelain feel organic, not quirky grafts. Slight risk in lyric repetition of “strum,” but it pays off.</comment>
