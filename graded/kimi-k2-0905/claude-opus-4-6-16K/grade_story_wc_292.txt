<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s “cartography as justice” creed is vivid, but the interiority drifts into label-speak (“old nervously confident tremor”) instead of embodied contradiction; the copper nail micro-choice is clean, yet the moment of handing it over is summary, not dramatized, so the cost is seen rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the sea disgorges Krauss’s journals, Maren can invoke Guild clause → reversal filed; the Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3 and the closure beat carries visible conceptual cost (“the maps, at last, made honest”)—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses the exile forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Weather station’s salt-streaked concrete and breathing-window winds are filtered through Maren’s surveyor eye; the copper nail acts as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, though the cliff-to-corridor spatial jump is slightly disembodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing Britta’s exile—is signaled early and tightens once: Halvorsen’s recognition of the rockfall coordinates forces the Guild filing; cost is conceptual (registry ink) rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not yet piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cartographic justice emerges through recovered coastline truth, not thesis; the final image of “truth of where the danger was” reweights earlier storm-tossed debris without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Maren’s surveyor perception; diction (“salt-streaked concrete,” “registry in careful ink”) is character-specific, rhythm modulates between reflective cadence and pressure-compressed clauses, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (description + pressure); only minor scaffold (“the air inside tasted of ozone and mildew, and every surface held a faint condensation, as though the building itself were sweating with dread”) repeats sensation, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combining climate-shifted jet stream with archival-justice cartography is fresh; the coded-poetry coordinate device is specific to northern maritime culture, resisting trope recycling, though the Guild-law reversal path is a recognizable historical-rectification arc.</comment>
