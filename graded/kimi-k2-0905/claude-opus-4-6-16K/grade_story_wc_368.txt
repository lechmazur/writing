<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sable’s interiority is vivid: the foreign heart as “someone else’s insistence on living,” palms to sternum, breathing as negotiation.  Her micro-choice to tilt the wing one degree crystallizes the arc; the borrowed beat knocks once, proving embodied emotion.  Flaws—envy, voyeuristic hunger for narrative—drive her quest and the final offer to write the family, sealing cost.  Voice remains singular; no relationship crucible on-page, so bullet waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of refracted light/angle builds density toward the final Conceptual Repricing—beauty as structure, not pigment.  Closure lands when Sable reweights her life: “entrusted light” replaces borrowed organ; cost is the ache of perpetual exposure.  No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 120 words.  Single shard, one transitionless scene; morpho wing and sun trails comprise the taught pattern that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house is no postcard: swaying rope bridge, rotating basalt, and sun trails that must be read to time the wing’s flare constrain every tactical tilt.  Mist, gorge exhalations, and stone’s parallelogram of light filter through Sable’s dye-master eye, selecting angles not scenery.  Micro-setting granted: the glass-plated wing on the table functions as curated environment whose refractive indices decide the climax.  Final image—“quietly explosive with blue”—recharges the structural metaphor, environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why stories magnetize—signaled early; tightens when wing’s color-shift forces the realization that identity can be architectural.  One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.  Cost is legible: lifelong vulnerability to every angle of light, foreclosing anonymity.  Escalation is textural density of light/angle rather than causal chain; pattern intensifies rather than reverses, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: color as structure equals life as angle, never pigment owned.  Subtext in silence—no dialogue, only gestures (tilt, inhale, palm to chest).  Ending offers resonant non-literal answer: “entrusted light” reframes transplant from theft to stewardship.  No moralizing; ambiguity survives—she will remain exposed, magnetized—yet meaning reconfigured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited drapes narration in Sable’s perceptual dye-vat: “colors she had never mixed,” “osmanthus” steam read as tint.  Rhythm mimics cautious steps across rope bridge—long sentences breathe, then fracture at wing flare: “erupted, a silent explosion.”  No dialogue, hence no voice convergence.  Compression like “quietly explosive” is taught early; pattern holds through final clause.  Elision of bridge crossing mechanics accepted under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-flawless: no loops, no scaffold, high density—“valley remembering its own breath” does triple atmospheric work.  Metaphors stay consistent within optic/texture domain; no mixed vehicles.  Strong verbs—“drifted,” “curl,” “knocked hard”—carry motion.  Minor elevate: “structural, born from” could lose comma; but artifact never touches closure. Read-aloud cadence rises to match silent eruption, then settles, mirroring emotional arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—organ recipient decodes donor’s narrative magnetism via iridescence—feels fresh yet inevitable.  Cartographer-donor and dye-master recipient create occupation symmetry that refracts same question.  Risk: lyric essayistic drift, but grounded in tactile wing manipulation pays off.  Specificity throughout—osmanthus tea, basalt sun trails—prevents abstraction overtaking story.</comment>
