<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirela’s quiet endurance and list-making are character-specific; the shift from silent distribution to ringing the bell crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she renounces anonymity and assumes communal voice. Internal contradiction (pride vs need) is shown through door-knocking beats, not labeled. No secondary character applies pressure on-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; solo arc earns high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each anonymous gift intensifies pattern until the bell reweights the stakes; resonance at closure is Charged Poise—the ridge hums with “accumulated silence,” a conceptual cost legible on the page. Orientation anchored by word 60; single transition (time-lapse “within a week”) is clean. No因果 reversal required under this lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: its columns provide hiding place for gifts, its acoustics amplify the bell’s single note that reconfigures community ritual. Sensory triangulation—fired clay, warm bread, dry-earth footfalls—filters through Mirela’s attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly during midnight runs. Object-as-setting (bell) charges final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve dignity while feeding the exiles. Escalation is accumulative—each nameless parcel tightens the ethical puzzle of anonymity until Mirela decides tobroadcast the gift-system, foreclosing pure secrecy. Cost is the exposure of receivers and the donor mystique. Under accretive lens, the deepening is sufficient; no causal antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated silent exchange: mutual aid can survive only if givers relinquish credit and receivers relinquish shame. Linked-hand motif on the bell reprises this without sermon. Final image—“accumulated silence of people caring”—offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers about donor identity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mirela’s perceptual signature: noticing who ate, who thinned, who knocked once. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for reflective beats, clipped prepositional phrases during night runs. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Filter verbs are sparse; diction stays within her lexicon. Final bell ring carries lyrical compression that matches prior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—single sustained metaphor of arbor as ancient ribs, paid off in final hush. High information density: one sentence often conveys time-passage, emotional shift, and sensory cue. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—anonymous aid in refugee camp—is refreshed by focus on acoustic signature (amplified quiet) and dignity economics. Risk taken with accretive, near-lyric structure rather than causal showdown; coherence holds. Specific detail (linked-hand bell engraving, three-border exodus) prevents swap-out. Not radically novel, but synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
