<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—guilt over wounding the town versus duty to truth—surfaces early and tightens the final drive south. The micro-choice to photograph the Charter before shipping it crystallizes her hierarchy: evidence over comfort. Cost is felt in the bruise-metaphor and the bare rosebush echo. Missing 9 only because the librarian/locksmith’s daughter remain off-page voices, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to mail the Charter reweights Eldvik’s mythos and Maren’s own identity, cost visible in the bare-rose / fragile-truth pairing. Causal chain—research → theft → publication—holds without gaps; each beat narrows options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (station roof, Tuesday). Lens stays Causal throughout. No artifact obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled platform and fractured glass act as lived-in obstacles: Maren steps over tendrils, uses the stationmaster desk as workbench, frames the photograph through broken panes. Rosebush petal supplies micro-setting that bookends the arc. Sensory hierarchy favors visual decay filtered through her archival gaze. Enough constraint and recurrence to reach 9-band; microscopic shortfall is absence of tactile weather (wind, damp) that could have pressed her packing choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus communal identity—tightens once: theft of the Charter removes the retreat option. Escalation is causal: each ally parallel shrinks her moral escape routes until publication becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in the bruise-chest line and the town’s impending wound. No reversal, but single meaningful tightening suffices at 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the illuminated lie itself: beauty can sanctify exploitation. Final image—gold leaf wrapped in acid-free tissue—reconfigures worship without sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: Maren knows she’s both surgeon and assailant. No thematic echo sentence; resonance carried by the rose/Charter juxtaposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“cataloguer of the lies nations tell themselves”) is historian-specific yet rhythmic. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during theft paragraph, mirroring risk. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay concrete (ivy “trying to read ghost schedules”). Voice modulation under pressure is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances archive, motive, or myth. Figurative layer (“verdict being handed down”) appears once and pays off in the final petal. Density high: one sentence slips in backstory, stakes, and occupation. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Proofing clean—Valdersen spelling consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Historian of fictions” reframes standard exposé plot into metahistorical heist; parallels method turns typical ally-gathering into epistemic debate. Illuminated forgery as luminous antagonist is fresh visual hook. Transformation evident: swap Charter with generic document and arc collapses. Risk taken in static theft (no chase) is justified by conceptual stakes.</comment>
