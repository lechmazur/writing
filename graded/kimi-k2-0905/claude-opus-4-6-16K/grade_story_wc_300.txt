<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marguerite’s shift from detached certifier to vulnerable confessor is embodied in the pearl-balancing moment; the internal contradiction between professional armor and private guilt is shown, not told. Micro-choice (knocking on the motel door) crystallizes the arc with visible cost—she forfeits her authority to become a carrier of communal shame. The residents remain off-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; their handwriting inside the shell acts as proxy pressure that still forces her pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearl reweights “shelter” from concrete bunker to shared exposure. Causal linkage is tight—because she condemned 19-Kappa, she alone can re-enter their confessional circuit and repurpose it. The final image (knock, out-held pearl) is a Decisive Change that forecloses her inspector distance and incurs social/occupational cost on the page. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props; the crack-to-cave discovery is motivated by her mandated final walkthrough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The calcite pedestal, shell spiral, and pearl serve as micro-setting that literally guides her hand and later her crown gesture; their tactile presence constrains the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy is inspector-trained—she notices substrate porosity, ventilation, then nacre micro-text—so detail feels character-filtered, not touristic. Crystal hush and low-frequency hum mirror the internal pressure shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless: crack → cathedral → pedestal → pocket → motel door.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what kind of shelter is worth saving?”—is signaled in the inciting condemnation. Escalation is accretive: each confession read increases her visceral debt until the only remaining option is to join the circuit. The reversal is her agency: she could walk away (professional armor intact) but instead crowns herself and speaks her own confession, narrowing future options to communal exposure. Cost is visible—she trades authority for precarious hope, pearl balanced literally on her skull.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of bunker logic: reinforced walls fail while spiraling confession succeeds. Subtext resides in the pearl—an irritant-layered beauty grown from shame, not grit. Final image reweights “radiance” as something released by communal admission rather than engineered shielding. No moralizing sentence; the knock itself is the thesis, offered without guarantee.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly with Marguerite’s perceptual signature—granular substrate observations, light that “learned patience,” heartbeat pressed to sternum. Syntax grows slightly unhinged during pearl-crowning beat, mirroring the dare/benediction duality. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests in her interior cadence, which modulates from clipped inspector efficiency to spiraling self-indictment. Free indirect style is clean: no filter-verb stacks, no committee voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high—each sentence advances discovery, emotional charge, or setting cue; no scaffold or synonym loops. Rhythm breathes with the scene: long clauses inside the cave, then staccato knock sequence outside. Metaphors are self-consistent (light learning patience, nacre of a different shelter) and never muddle causality. Final line (“she held out the pearl”) carries echo-earned weight without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The doomsday inspector discovering a confessional crystal cave is a fresh angle; the pearl as reverse bunker grown from shame reconfigures trope expectations. Specificity—“freeze-dried lentils,” “intake forms,” “crown of her skull”—anchors novelty in lived detail. Transformation test fails: the emotional arc needs the exact bunker/seashell mechanics, names are not interchangeable. Risk (lyric magical realism inside a hard-tech job) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
