<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—choosing stars over stones, silence over shared grief—is palpable and embodied in the telegram’s creases. The micro-choice to write the letter crystallizes her shift, but the cost feels scaled to vignette rather than full arc; we’re told the stone is “lighter,” not shown how her future tactics change. Still, the voice-specific memory of the dream figures and the observatory routines keep her credibly idiosyncratic. A hair more consequence-on-the-page would nudge this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of writing and the dream-hand acceptance reweight the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-twist, yet every beat (telegram reread, daylily scent, variable-star geometry) tightens the shared-burden pattern toward the final breathing image. The lens holds; no orientation debt. The only restraint preventing 9.0 is that the decisive cost is interior and quiet rather than visibly constraining next-action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory is sketched with professional selectivity—red lamp, leather-bound volumes, telescope trained on Cygnus—each detail filtering Elena’s sky-versus-earth avoidance. The daylily functions as micro-setting, its pressed sweetness anchoring maternal presence in a tactile, choice-guiding way. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; weather and altitude appear only as fog that erases the world, mirroring her prior erasure of grief. Setting never forces a tactical constraint, so it stops just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep carrying the stone alone?—is signaled early and deepened through each reread of the telegram. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses letter-writing over star-cataloging, trading empirical distance for vulnerable witness; this narrows her identity path with felt emotional price. Pressure is accumulative/textural, not externalized, but sufficient for 600-word scope. A crisper external ramification (burn the logbook? send the letter?) would punch the cost into 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the binaries—eclipsing stars vs. carved prayers, sky vs. soil—without authorial thesis. The final image of the stone held between two hands reconfigures the opening premise that “light was easier to read,” proving witness is also data. Subtext in the dream figures and the daylily’s lingering scent invites reflective re-reading. Only the faintest whisper of echo-chamber reassurance keeps it from perfect resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s perceptual signature—mathematical yet aching—syntax lengthening under reflection, fragmenting during memory jolts. No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythm; diction (“breathing stars,” “color of old honey”) remains hers, not writerly flourish. Red-lamp filter and telegram creases show consistent psychic distance. A marginal 0.2 deduction for one near-stock phrase “deep wells of her unconscious” that momentarily sounds like workshop voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling without scaffold; information dual-loads (star physics mirrors emotional eclipse). Figurative layer is selective—no mixed metaphors—and peaks only after the causality is clear, preserving momentum. Zero loops, zero filter-verb clutter. Final line cadence matches respiratory image, earning read-aloud satisfaction. Microscopically under the 9.0 floor only because one clause (“she told herself the sky was cleaner”) edges toward explanatory shorthand.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream chronicler and variable-star cosmology feels fresh, not grafted; the insight that eclipse geometry models shared grief is non-obvious. Temple-inversion (curses → prayers) risks trope but is saved by personal telegram delivery and pressed flower relic. Risk level is moderate—quiet interior arc rather than plot gymnastics—but coherence justifies the choice. Doesn’t reach 8.5 because the core emotional beat (write letter / accept dream hand) is a familiar release template.</comment>
