<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maret’s interiority is concrete—his fingers rasp on limestone, his coat is wiped on fish-oil soot—showing a man whose intellectual obsession is inseparable from bodily endurance. The “abrasive calm” voice threads every micro-choice: scraping one more millimeter, lecturing emptiness, refusing both Restorationist and Foundationist simplifications. Contradictory impulses (preservation vs. futility) collide in-scene, not in summary; the final renunciation—continuing to scrape while predicting another drowning—pays a palpable cost in torn knuckles and social isolation. No secondary character appears, but the sewer and cog act as pressure proxies, keeping relational stakes implicit yet legible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maret keeps scraping, accepting the cost of futile memory-work while factions above ignore him. The final image—“the cog’s tiny teeth still meshed with a ghost mechanism”—reweights the entire premise: knowledge persists only through solitary, unpaid labor. Causal chain holds: because the sewer refused to drown, Maret stayed; because he stays, he uncovers hybrid artifacts that collapse both dogmas; because collapse is ignored, he must keep scraping. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors (“after the plague ended,” “tilted platforms of half-submerged plazas”) arrive inside 120 words and feed the final poignancy.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the limestone ledge, black canal, and fish-oil lamp constrain every move—chiseling angle limited by damp thigh-room, lamp smoke stinging eyes during close cog inspection. Brass cog and sediment strata evolve from backdrop to decision-drivers; the brass teeth literalize “ghost mechanism” in the closure image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors philosopher-scavenger priorities: mineral taste of silt, metallic tang of rust, distant echo of plaza arguments are filtered through epistemic hunger, not tourist spectacle. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible reaches or drifting body parts across the single-scene window.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve method versus ideological erasure—tightens once: the cog discovery collapses both factional histories yet is dismissed, forcing Maret into perpetual salvage as the last living archive. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each scraped layer adds weight to the silence above, reweighting the cost of being ignored rather than narrowing external options. The price is visceral: shredded fingertips, lamp-oil lung sting, social exile. No coincidence; the sea and plague are prior calamities, not rescuers. The tightening suffices for 800-word scope, though a second external jeopardy beat could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through sediment and cog: knowledge is a stratified, corroded, manual labor that cannot outshout ideology. The final image re-prices the concept—time-keeping precision now ghost-meshed—without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: coat-wipe transfers canal muck onto philosopher’s wool, literally wearing the evidence. Ambiguity is meaningful: reader must decide whether Maret’s endurance is heroic pathology or civic duty; story refuses to pronounce.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; “abrasive calm” diction never slips into editorial omniscience. Syntax mirrors excavation rhythm—layered clauses, participle chiseling, metallic consonants—so prose itself performs the dig. No dialogue; narrative voice carries all subtext through ironic lecture-to-nobody. Register stays within self-taught philosopher lexicon (“epistemology,” “mercantile republic”) yet grounded in scavenger tactility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers physical action, historiographic argument, and emotional cost (“He would agonize over a single artifact for days. Weeks.”). Figurative control: metaphor of sediment-as-text is single, sustained, never mixed. Minor scaffold: “layer by layer, each one a sentence” slightly paraphrases prior idea; loosens final-band entry but does not touch closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at climax, then falls into resigned long sentence for last scrape.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—philosopher-sewer-scavenger versus competing post-catastrophe mythmakers—is fresh synthesis of flood-survivor and archive-race tropes. Brass chronometer cog as Rosetta stone that refutes both sacred and mercantile teleologies feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Voice risk (lecturing emptiness) pays off by making futility dramatic, not abstract. Specificity of limestone bedrock, fish-oil lamp, and dentist-patience chiseling anchors universals in unrepeatable detail. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—this drowned Theriac and its navigator gear are irreplaceable.</comment>
