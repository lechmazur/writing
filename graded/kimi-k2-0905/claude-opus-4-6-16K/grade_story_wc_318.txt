<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edwin’s grief-propelled obsession is tactile—taped pull-cords, throat-sore lullaby, refusal to quit—yet the interior contradiction (hope vs. knowledge it’s absurd) stays live until the small laugh re-weights everything. Micro-choices (angle-adjusting blowers, deciding to keep singing when Bea appears) show hierarchy of values with visible fatigue. Earned Stasis lands: he hasn’t “fixed” Bea, but the tunnel’s cost (his voice raw, estate still doomed) is felt. Only cap is slight safety-hedge—his flaws don’t boomerang hard enough to threaten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the laugh’s echo reconfigures silence vs. sound stakes with undeniable emotional cost under Accumulative lens (density of layered wind + lullaby). Causality intact: each blower added = texture shift; decision to sing after spotting Bea = final intensifier. Orientation clean by line 8; no lens drift. Persistent constraint—estate sale deadline—shapes tactics throughout. Minor waiver: laugh not a decisive physical act yet functions as resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in “fading resonance” line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tunnel geometry isn’t backdrop—it channels air, dictates blower angles, and literally carries the sound that cracks Bea’s composure. Concrete cold under bare feet, bass note returning “threefold” give tactile immediacy; selective detail skips blueprint exposition. Object-as-setting (electrical-taped pull cords) micro-constrains Edwin’s sore fingers, charging final image. Setting evolution: sound waves themselves become mutable walls that soften, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Bea’s laughter—tightens through acoustic density, not external antagonist. Each blower adds harmonic pressure; Edwin’s choice to keep singing when seen = on-page trade-off (pride vs. vulnerability). Cost visible: voice shredded, sale deadline still looms. Escalation is textural but coherent under Accumulative lens; option space narrows from “six blowers” to zero as they die, leaving only echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from acoustic metaphor: the unspoken needs resonance, not repair. Subtext lives in gesture—Bea’s polite smile, Edwin’s taped fingers—never thesis. Final laugh is harder, smaller, refusing tidy restoration yet acknowledging loss. No moralizing; echo reweights premise without pronouncement, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Edwin’s sensorium: “worn thin by grief,” “macerated into something granular.” Rhythmic control—long clauses for wind buildup, fragment “He almost stopped” under pressure. No head-hopping; Bea’s interior accessed only through observable tremble. Distinct perceptual signature sustained; elision of technical diagrams is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “pull cord handles wrapped in electrical tape worn thin by grief” packs object, history, emotion. No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language (“cathedral,” “porcelain”) appears sparingly and serves tone. Filter verbs used only when motivated by sonic distance. Final paragraph varies cadence to mimic dying resonance—clean exit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leaf-blower symphony as grief ritual is non-obvious and inseparable from emotional arc; swap blowers for any device and the acoustic logic collapses. Invention deepens rather than distracts, turning industrial noise into fragile carrier of love. Risk-taking (no antagonist, no dialogue) heightens lyric coherence. Fresh inflection feels inevitable in hindsight—sound as parental language when words fail.</comment>
