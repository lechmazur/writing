<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ozu’s tactile mending, the private whisk-test, and the final folded-net gesture crystallize a lifetime of attention; contradiction is implied but never dramatized in-scene, keeping the arc at strong-not-exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Earned Stasis: the net’s perfect lattice and the firefly escort reweight “hidden effort” with undeniable cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though moon-path causality is poetic rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Parapet whisper, moonlit flagstones, and bamboo-whisk water-test integrate setting into every micro-choice; the parapet’s acoustic feedback literally guides mending tension—environment as constraint, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing vs. overlooking hidden labor—tightens once when moonlight reveals micro-tears; the price is the lifelong solitude implied, but on-page pressure is contemplative, not acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: knots, moon paths, firefly pulses all accrete into “attention as love”; final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing—resonant, oblique, enduring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person clings to Ozu’s perceptual bias—needle as reader, rain as chorus—syntax stretches and contracts like wet twine; zero head-hop, disciplined diction, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence cadence, high information density, only one soft loop (“moonlight passed through it in a perfect, unbroken lattice” restates prior weave); no mixed metaphor, no scaffold beats near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fisherman-philosopher trope is refreshed by moon-path diagnostics and whisk hydraulics; the quiet risk—no antagonist, no plot twist—pays off via accumulative lyric pattern rather than surprise.</comment>
