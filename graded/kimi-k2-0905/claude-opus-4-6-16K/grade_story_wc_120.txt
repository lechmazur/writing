<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s contradictory hunger for silence-as-song is embodied in every micro-choice (hand-tremor, shell-to-ear ritual, invented notation). The final renunciation—abandoning conventional fortune compression for an unplayable score—pays the cost of perpetual outsider status, legible in her mirrored suspension between skies. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; even “chronologically homesick” is instantly re-weighted by sensory anchor (grandmother’s humming, tin-roof rain). Only the lack of a second on-page character keeps the stake from full crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the symphony is “already begun” in collective memory, reconfiguring her solitary labor into shared quiet. The nautilus spiral and mirrored horizon persist as constraints that shaped tactics (memory-mapping method, page-limit of 23). Orientation anchors within 50 words; no prop or rule breaks causality. Exhaustion deadline tightens the final notation beat, its cost visible in trembling hands and softened vision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass spire / frozen lake functions as both literal workspace and metaphorical tuning fork, doubling sky to literalize “between times.” The nautilus segment acts as micro-setting, its chambers dictating the score’s radial form and occluding her palm under fatigue. Every environmental detail is filtered through Mei Lin’s sonic bias: dawn light is “a breath held and released,” ice becomes percussion. Setting constrains the climax—she must finish before daylight dissolves the mirrored horizon that inspired the method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion”—is signaled early and sharpened by bodily countdown. The single meaningful tightening lands when dawn ignites the mirrored horizon: she must stop writing, yet the piece feels unfinished. Cost is legible: trembling hands, blurred vision, the spire’s prism scattering colors across pages as irreversible benediction. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negative space of sound: what cannot be heard still structures life. Subtext lives in gesture—shell to ear, pages weighted by silence—never in exposition. The final image reweights all earlier fortunes as mere shards of the larger score, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the symphony is both liberation and exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice carries a lyric compression that mirrors fortune-cookie brevity yet expands into sustained musical cadence. Perceptual signature is sonic-first: “frequency of rain,” “duration of one held breath.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens authentically under fatigue. Patterned elision (“Begin in the key of wet stone”) is taught early and paid off in the final notation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, sound, or emotional stakes. Metaphors are precise and mutually reinforcing—spire as tuning fork, dawn as breath—never mixed. Syntax modulates with exhaustion: longer sentences fray, then snap into fragmentary notation. Opening and closing lines act as musical pickups and cadence, book-ending the spiral form.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of musical notation with fortune-cookie poetics feels inevitable yet fresh; no template plot is followed. Risk-taking—an unplayable score as climax—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specific coastal Chinese memory shards (Qingdao shore, tin roof) resist generic anywhere-setting. Only the mirrored horizon concept flirts with familiarity, but its deployment as compositional constraint transforms it.</comment>
