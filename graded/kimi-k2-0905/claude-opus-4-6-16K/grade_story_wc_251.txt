<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—fear that her quiet rebellion is pointless—remains abstract until the final notebook line; prior beats show her listening and arranging but not wrestling the fear in scene. The earned cost (admitting fear on paper) lands, yet the causal chain is more accumulative than driven by micro-choices under rising personal risk; still, her perceptual signature and embodied care for “wounded bird” fragments keep her singular and flawed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the blank notebook filled with her own swallowed words crystallizes the stakes and cost on-page. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each window display and the grotto installation layer density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; the library and town anchors arrive by line 3. One transition (town → grotto) is legible; no causal or spatial break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt library’s bruise-colored walls and fogged windows constrain entry and amplify silence, directly feeding Maren’s ability to “hear” swallowed words. The magnetic grotto’s starlit iron ledges physically hold open the notebooks, turning setting into active collaborator in the closure image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the town’s storefronts evolve weekly, tracking plot progression without static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can unspoken truths change a town—tightens as displays move from single windows to the grotto’s collective confession; the final notebook entry shows Maren’s own truth now irreversible. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each display widens recognition until the grotto confrontation forces her to surrender anonymity. Cost is visible: her private fear is now inked and star-lit, foreclosing pure spectatorship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—quiet rebellion via heard silence—emerges through object arrangements and the final personal confession, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: the queen chess piece on its side reweights “winning” without commentary. The ending’s forest of second thoughts is felt, not labeled; ambiguity lingers about whether the town will act, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, bruised cadence that mirrors the library’s color and the story’s amplified quiet. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices “sentences that dissolved on tongues” and cradles fragments “like a wounded bird.” No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under emotional peaks. Syntax modulates—long breathless sentences for accumulation, short fragment for the final notebook line—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “the silence of suppression but of recognition” does triple duty—sonic, thematic, emotional. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors clutter the closure beat. One scaffold loop detected—“swallowed words” appears three times in close succession—minor drag but does not touch the final image. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—librarian curates town’s unspoken guilt via storefront art-installations—feels fresh yet inevitable. The magnetic grotto repurposes a natural anomaly as confession booth, transforming familiar motifs. Risk: quiet rebellion without marches could read as twee, but the final self-exposure avoids self-congratulation. Specificity—compass pointing nowhere, queen on its side—prevents generic anywhere-ness.</comment>
