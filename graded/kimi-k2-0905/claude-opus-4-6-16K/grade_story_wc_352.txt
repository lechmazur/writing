<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s prism-mind is shown, not told, through every beat; the stolen page, the timed inversion, the camera tremble all crystallize her obsessive need to catalogue forbidden combinations. Interiority stays concrete—“her prism-mind already splitting implications”—and the final burden lands as earned cost: she decides which vaults open, camera clutched to chest. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she decodes the doodle → enters grotto → inversion reveals door → photographs index → accepts burden. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she exits with every lock’s name and the price of guardianship. Anchors clear by line 3; no teleporting props; gravity rule is taught, used, and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s mineral arcs, ankle-deep mist, and gravity-flipped stalactites constrain every move; the lantern’s limited arc literally shapes what she can photograph in time. Environment charges the final image: the sealed ceiling-door waits “patient as always,” mirroring her new, inverted worldview. Specificity is selective—no tourist catalog—and every sensory hit tightens the ticking clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access the master index before gravity reverts—tightens at 22 min, 17 min, 41 min markers. One meaningful escalation: inversion flips floor/ceiling, forcing her to act while floating. Cost is visible: bruised ribs, camera clutched, lifelong custodial burden accepted. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: knowledge itself is a gravitational inversion—what was hidden becomes ceiling, what was ceiling becomes responsibility. No moralizing; the final image of “every lock now had a name” reweights prior refractions without stating a thesis. Subtext in the doodle’s serpent devouring the key whispers that guardianship devours the seeker. Complexity lingers: liberation and catastrophe held in one frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—“her prism-mind,” “spectral components”—with rhythmic, clause-stacked syntax that mimics splitting light. No head-hopping; diction stays within her scholarly lexicon. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“she felt the shift”) they mark bodily inversion. Final line lands with crystalline cadence that mirrors the opening refraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or clock. Metaphors are coherent—mist “remembering some ancient light” sustains the luminosity motif without contradiction. Syntax accelerates during inversion, then lengthens as she photographs, matching tempo. No register drift; technical terms (gravitational inversion, alphanumeric sequences) are earned and accurate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archival thriller with gravitational theology feels fresh; the doodle-as-seed and inversion-as-lock-pick synthesize two unlikely domains. Risky one-hour gravity window is taught early and exploited fully. Final burden—archivist becomes arbiter of all sealed knowledge—reconfigures genre expectations. Could not swap grotto for generic cave without breaking causal logic.</comment>
