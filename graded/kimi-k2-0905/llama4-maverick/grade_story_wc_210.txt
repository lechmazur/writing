<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alchemist’s interiority is vivid—refusing “false comfort” fuels the conceit—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; the stance is monolithic. No micro-choice is dramatized: we watch them “ponder,” “recall,” “rise,” never decide under immediate pressure. The promised cost of reimagining a civilization is announced, not paid on this page; thus the arc feels prospective, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a declarative pivot (“now it was time to bring their vision to life”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no option is foreclosed, no price is shown. Causal chain is iterative summary—“they pondered…they recalled…they began to work”—with no tightening beat that narrows possibility. Working-memory gimmick is asserted but never complicates or limits tactics; therefore the lens drifts toward decorative Accumulative rather than causal drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is anchored early, sensuously decayed, and gains micro-setting power when lanterns “grow brighter” in response to thought, turning atmosphere into feedback. Spatial choreography stays light but coherent; the amber bottle’s unmoving presence supplies a concrete pivot. The town is sketched in festival-memory rather than physical detail; still, the cove’s lantern light is used twice to refract interior state, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—remains abstract; no external or internal obstacle ever threatens it on-page. Pressure is declarative (“the task was daunting”) but static; neither time, resource, nor opposition tightens. Because no visible price is risked or paid here, escalation is rhetorical rather than operative under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebirth through imaginative refusal of nostalgia is coherent but surfaced in summary: “they rejected false comfort.” The amber bottle’s etched, sealed surface offers a mute emblem of potential yet never revises meaning at the end; its symbolism stays ornamental. Final uplift is asserted rather than reweighted by a costly image, keeping resonance moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled cadence; repetition of “the alchemist” becomes incantatory, teaching an accumulative pattern. Diction stays elevated but consistent—“gleamed with a fierce intensity,” “crystallized like a map”—without register drift. No dialogue to test, and perceptual signature is generic mage-ascetic; still, rhythmic propulsion carries the meditation cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and openers, avoiding template cadence. Occasional scaffold (“the alchemist’s eyes… the alchemist’s hands… the alchemist’s thoughts”) loops subject without deepening pressure; not severe enough to dull closure. Metaphors remain coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple overload, but density is light rather than multi-layered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Ghost-town revival via sealed amber bottle + working memory” is an fresh triad; bottle stays closed, sidestepping genie cliché. Conceptual risk is moderate—story stays in visionary lyric mode rather than dramatized conflict—but execution is careful, not bold. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet not transformative; stakes remain external to the character’s interior glow.</comment>
