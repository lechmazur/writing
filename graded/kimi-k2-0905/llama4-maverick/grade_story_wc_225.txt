<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The exiled tutor’s need for self-forgiveness is concrete and embodied in his fraying fingers and red-rimmed eyes; the tapestry decoding directly channels this need into forward action. Internal contradiction is quietly alive—he both courts and fears the truth in the weave. The moment he “rises to his feet” after the last thread is decoded shows a micro-choice that costs him passivity; the guilt-to-redemption arc, though compressed, tracks. Voice stays consistent and specific to a chess teacher’s pattern-seeking mind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: because he decodes the tapestry, therefore he finds the labyrinth; because he walks it, therefore he reweights his guilt. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (time-frozen village, cobblestone street, ozone) and the rule-set of frozen time is taught early. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he leaves the labyrinth with “deep, abiding peace,” the visible cost being his prior exile and the labor of decoding. Minor slip: the thunder-lull timeframe never tightens decisions; it’s mood only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen village is rendered through tactile micro-details—wet-earth scent, abandoned shoes mid-stride, the tutor’s knees on cold stone—so the setting doubles as emotional crucible. Spatial choreography is clean: tapestry on cobbles → standing → portal → twisting passages → emergence into bright day; no impossible moves. Platinum labyrinth returns in the final image, now reweighted from mystery to absolution, satisfying the 9+ gate. One nit: “glittering portal” is visual shorthand; still, the mirrored passages serve as recursive setting-as-psyche.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates because each decoded thread narrows his moral options: continue self-loathing or face the labyrinth. The labyrinth walk externalizes escalating pressure; each reflection forces stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt: “weight of guilt slowly lifting” implies ebbing emotional debt. No external antagonist needed; the internal conflict is tested and foreclosed by his decision to leave the labyrinth renewed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges from the concrete labor of decoding rather than overt statement; the tapestry’s shifting meaning (failure → map → redemption) supplies the thematic reconfiguration. Subtext resides in the tutor’s silence—he never names his student’s loss aloud, letting the frayed threads speak. Final image of village “weaving themselves back together” offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: time resumes because he has paid the emotional cost. Avoids sermonizing; the reconfiguration is felt, not named.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtered through the tutor’s pattern-seeking attention; no head-hopping, no POV leakage. Syntax is compressed and rhythmic—“fidgeted productively,” “woven hush”—mirroring a chess tutor’s love of precision. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue remains concrete (“his eyes, red-rimmed...”). Register stable; no filter-verb stacks or corporate diction. Voice matches the lyric-accumulative design and pays off in the final “fierce repose” cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences pull double duty—every image advances either tapestry decoding or guilt modulation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is sparse and coherent (“shroud of hush,” “ebbing of a tide”). Opening line anchors mood and stakes; final line resolves with image of door-closing threads. One micro-slip: “glittering portal that seemed to pulse” is filler “seemed”; still, the beat is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Forgiveness-through-weaving is fresh; combines chess tutor’s pattern obsession with textile code, avoiding generic amnesia tropes. The platinum labyrinth as reflective psyche-maze is familiar, but its mirror facets are particularized to his former student loss. Transformation test fails: names/places could swap, yet the tapestry-chess-labyrinth triad is idiosyncratic enough to feel author-anchored. Quiet risk in lyric accumulative structure, paid off by coherent closure.</comment>
