<comment>The adjuster’s interior contradiction—tender caretaker of cosmic gears yet privately bruised—glows through embodied awe and trembling fingers. Micro-choices (kissing the cracked puppet, slowing to match dusk’s breath) reveal a hierarchy that prizes fragility over self-preservation. The ending’s earned renunciation—accepting perpetual vigilance—pays the cost foreshadowed by the porcelain flaws. Voice remains singular, never lapsing into diagnostic speak, though the lone figure limits relationship crucible testing.</comment>

<comment>Situational lens holds: coherent pressure = dying daylight + hush-field that demands stance crystallization. The closure is a Charged Poise: adjuster finishes calibration, whispers lullaby, and the hush thickens into living membrane—cost is the eternal vigilance legible in the shimmering pane. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 w, taught by glass-pane frame. No causality breaks; luck complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<comment>Lighthouse glass operates as micro-setting: its amplifying hush literally warps sound and choice, constraining the adjuster to near-silent gestures. Dusk’s fading light is tracked beat-by-beat, dictating tempo of the final calibration. Pane and puppet return as charged objects, the cracked porcelain re-illuminating the glass flaws in the last image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as the adjuster circles the lantern room.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake = preserve fragile universal balance before nightfall; signaled early. Escalation is situational: dying light narrows time, hush thickens, forcing slower, more reverent motions—visible cost is the adjuster’s bruised awe deepening into sober vigilance. One meaningful tightening: last ray fades → lullaby must be whispered immediately. No reversal, but pressure coherence suffices under situational lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme of “fragility as sacred” emerges through recurrence of cracked glass & porcelain, never abstract assertion. Final image—shimmering pane—reweights earlier “pane of hush” from metaphor to living interface, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: kiss to broken puppet = covenant with flawed cosmos. Avoids sentimentality by keeping awe bruised, not celebratory.</comment>

<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is hush-filtered, sound-dampened, light-obsessed. Rhythm modulates: long voweled clauses mimic dusk drag; final lullaby lines compress into near-spondees. No head-hopping; knowledge stays adjuster-bound. Register remains within a caretaker-poet lexicon—no corporate intrusion.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dusk; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“pane of hush” taught early, paid off in shimmering closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “the adjuster’s task… the adjuster’s actions…” repetition (−0.2) but does not dull closure image. High density: single sentences fuse light, emotion, mechanism.</comment>

<comment>Doomsday-clock caretaker in hidden lighthouse is fresh angle; trope of apocalypse manager interiorized into lyric vigilance. Broken puppet as cosmic key feels specific, not gimmick—its cracks drive the thematic equation of beauty ↔ flaw. Risk: quiet lullaby instead of bang, but coherence holds. Synthesis earns +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
