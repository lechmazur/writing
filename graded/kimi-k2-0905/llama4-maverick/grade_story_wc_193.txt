<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s “virtuously mischievous” grin is mentioned twice but never manifests in a concrete choice; the bolt-touch is the only micro-action. Interiority stays generic (“felt an inexplicable connection”). No contradictory impulses under pressure; she simply follows glitchy instructions. Closure feels lucky, not earned—no visible cost or enduring flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a sparkly release of diamonds with no causal cost or constraint; luck, not choice, produces the turn. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure → glitter—but the final image reweights nothing because Lyra sacrifices nothing. The Orientation Test is waived: the mushroom-farm glow is taught early and does serve the final shimmer, so no penalty, yet the lack of motivated escalation keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is more than wallpaper: the soft light refracts through the falling diamonds, charging the final image as required for 9+ gate (a). Selective fungal scent and blue-green glow steer Lyra’s attention and pace. Spatial tracking stays clean; no exotic surplus. One vivid, purposeful environment suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“fulfill the quantum promise”—stays abstract; no visible price tightens options. Pressure escalates only as off-screen machine “build-up,” then instantly resolves into free diamonds. Lyra’s volunteer act alters no tactic; she is passive conduit, not agent. Cost is neither felt nor conceptual, so the required tightening under Accumulative lens never lands.</comment>

<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation through pressure emerges implicitly from mushroom-glow → diamond glitter, avoiding overt thesis. Yet the quantum premise stays decorative, so thematic lift is modest. Final image re-illuminates earlier glow, supplying quiet resonance. No moralizing, but also no lasting moral cost, keeping score mid-tier.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hop. Prose rhythm modulates—long fungal sentences contract to staccato “diamonds rained down.” Perceptual signature relies on sweet fungal scent and child-like wonder, consistent if not startling. Lyric elision (“glitchy text messages”) is taught early and paid off, satisfying experimental allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and paints image (“sweet with the scent of fungal growth and the soft glow”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent. One register drift—“shadowseam wonder” coined phrase—feels authorial but brief, not muddling closure. Read-aloud cadence climbs naturally to the diamond shower.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Combining pyramid-scheme trauma, quantum texts, and pressure-to-diamond biotech yields fresh mash-up. Bolt-as-key is telegraphed but still pleases. Conceptual integrity holds: farm glow literalizes into diamond glitter. Risk is moderate; not transformative, yet avoids stock tropes. Synthesis feels specific to this voice, not a prompt checklist.</comment>
