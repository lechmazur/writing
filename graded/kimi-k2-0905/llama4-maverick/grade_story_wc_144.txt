<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emilia’s blind-savant calibration feels lived-in, not magical; the unwavering serenity borders on saintly and flattens the internal contradiction meter. No visible cost or error undercuts her competence, so the arc is static grace rather than earned struggle. Still, the embodied detail of touch-guided work keeps her from slipping into trope.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s steady hover reframes the depot’s mist and the ship’s departure into a single re-tuned frequency, felt cost is the hush after exertion. Causal chain is slim—light-through-water “reads” are more poetic conceit than engineering beat—but the accumulative pattern holds. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Mist, fountain droplets, and drone iridescence braid into one micro-climate; the rail depot never becomes a postcard because every visual returns as calibration data. The shop’s tactile layout (bench, fountain, hummingbird perch) constrains every reach and twist. Environment is inseparable from the fix—no swap-out possible without breaking the final image.</comment>

<comment>Stake is single: make the drone fly true. Pressure tightens only once—final tweak while the anchor breaks surface—yet that moment is pure cadence shift rather than option foreclosure. No tangible price is extracted from Emilia; the risk is all off-stage reputation. Enough escalation to satisfy short-form, but not punching into higher cost band.</comment>

<comment>Theme of resonance-over-sight emerges through water-light-droneship triad; no character ever names it. Final image re-prices the depot as tuned instrument rather than relic of industry. Calm-as-magnetism remains an asserted, not dramatized, quality—slight sentimental bleed—but the refusal to moralize keeps the score high.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Emilia’s haptic attention; diction is lean, rhythmic, slightly elevated to match the meditative tempo. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor density is high but patterned early (“mist…like a living entity”) so payoff is earned. Voice never cracks into workshop-y soundscape cliché.</comment>

<comment>Sentence music is deliberate—long breathless units mimic fog swirl, then shorten on the final tweak. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “mist-coated” recurs but as deliberate motif. Metaphors stay coherent (light, water, vibration); no mixed vehicles. Two near-purple phrases (“heartbeat of industry”) survive because they land at closure where cadence trumps plainness.</comment>

<comment>Blind mechanic decoding navigation via rainbow refraction is the fresh hinge; it feels inevitable once the fountain appears. Risk is calm-stasis instead of conflict, but that gamble serves the accumulative design. Not quite a 9 because the premise could transplant to another artisan shop with only cosmetic edits.</comment>
