<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The artist’s face-blindness is never embodied; instead we’re told they “discern hidden patterns.” The renunciation – leaving the library with the coin as talisman – is earned, but the interior contradiction (noble vs. quixotic) is announced rather than dramatized in a single beat. Micro-choices are present (opening the safe, pocketing the coin) yet carry no visible trade-off under the ticking clock. Still, the occupation-specific perceptual lens is consistently rendered and the final stance costs the artist the sanctuary itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portrait glows while machines wait, reweighting the infinite/finite stakes. Causality is accumulative: each sensory layer (dappled light → coin indentations → brushstrokes) tightens the same thematic vise rather than chaining because/therefore turns. Orientation is clean by word 60; the demolition clock is a persistent constraint. The cost is legible in the final image – the sky trapped inside doomed bark – satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is not wallpaper: its hollowed shelves, musty air, and filtered light literally shape what can be seen and saved. The coin’s micro-topography functions as portable setting/body hybrid that guides the final brushstrokes, constraining the last possible mark. Spatial choreography holds as the artist steps back, bag slung, machines outside. One slip: “the city’s relentless march” is generic; the rest is specific and tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake – mirror the sky before erasure – is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each sensory accretion; no secondary stake dilutes it. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the coin’s indentations redirect the brush, foreclosing any other possible image. Cost is felt: the portrait will outlive the library by minutes, then perish. No reversal, but the accumulative pattern adequately escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: finite craft chasing infinite sky, paid for by demolition. The coin’s worn surface and the fractal brushwork are particulars that return reweighted in the final glow. No moral is extracted; the resonance is imagistic. Only a hairline slip – “limits of human understanding” is near-abstract – but it is embedded in tactile discovery, so the thematic echo penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person focalization stays snug to the artist’s perceptual filter: fractal precision, dappled light, parchment scent. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato pre-demolition beats. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. “Musty silence,” “golden light filtering” risk lyric cliché, but the pattern is consistent and purposeful, so the voice remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors (“sky mirrored within walls”) are stable and recharged at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. One near-purple line – “fractally precise renderings” – is repeated, but it is motif-anchored, not decorative, so the overwriting cap is not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The face-blind artist inside a dendritic library is a fresh synthesis; the coin-as-brush-compass transforms a heist prop into metaphysical tool. Risk is high – quiet lyric ending in a demolition countdown – yet coherence holds. The stillness/demolition tension is an original emotional engine rather than a twist. Specific detail (guild-hollowed trunk, dappled indigo) prevents template drift.</comment>
