<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Naomi’s desire to “uncover truth” is declared repeatedly but never crystallized into a single, high-stakes choice; her interiority drifts into generic awe (“inexplicable connection,” “heart ablaze”) rather than embodied contradiction. Ada’s retrocognitive entrapment is only label-deep—no on-page cost or behavioral limit emerges—so the relationship never becomes a crucible that forces Naomi to pay or renounce anything. The ending’s “she would return…until the secrets were fully revealed” is a restatement of the opening want, not an earned change or stasis with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft vow of future return, not a decisive change or charged poise with felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image merely re-invokes the lagoon rather than reweighting stakes. Causality is loose: the diary is mentioned as trigger but never decodes on-page; Ada’s debris messages are watched, not acted upon, so the parley produces no tactical shift. Orientation is clear early, yet the midpoint drifts into repetitive scenic stasis rather than a meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vividly sensed—smell of aged paper, mirror-like water—and the window-framed vista is used to filter Naomi’s attention. Selective detail (raised letters, beach debris patterns) stays inside her perception, avoiding catalog excess. However, no environmental feature ever constrains her movement or limits choice; the lagoon remains metaphoric backdrop rather than tactical object, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—“search for truth,” “secrets waiting”—but never specified or tested; no visible price (time, risk, social credit) is exacted across the beats. Pressure is ambient awe, not escalating constraint; the parley imparts information off-stage and Naomi leaves with the same goal intact. A single meaningful tightening or trade-off is absent, so escalation plateaus at ornamental curiosity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of buried history versus living memory is emergent but thin; the diary and Ada’s debris art gesture toward it yet never collide in a way that reconfigures meaning. Final paragraph’s “mysteries that lay just beneath the surface” states the metaphor outright, blunting subtext. Resonance is atmospheric rather than earned through costly choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close to Naomi with consistent perceptual filter—paper scent, embossed letters—creating a hushed, reverent cadence that suits “searing reverie.” Syntax is controlled, no head-hopping; however, voice leans on stock phrases (“heart ablaze,” “swirl of memories”) that dull idiosyncrasy. Dialogue is minimal and indistinct, preventing full voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; sentences vary in length and advance atmosphere. Occasional soft fillers—“strange and wondrous place,” “forgotten documents”—slightly dilute density. Metaphors stay coherent, register stable; no artifact obscures causality or closure. A tighter final-third cut of abstract qualifiers would edge toward 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Floating civil-rights archive aboard a zeppelin is a fresh conceptual splice; the obsidian lagoon beneath dunes adds surreal texture. Yet the execution drifts into familiar lyrical templates of mournful archivist + cryptic elder + opaque artifact, so the novelty feels under-exploited. Risk is present but muted: no rule-breaking structure or ethical twist lifts the piece into unforgettable territory.</comment>
