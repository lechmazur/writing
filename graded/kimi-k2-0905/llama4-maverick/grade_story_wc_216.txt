<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timekeeper’s interiority is lyrically textured—‘the texture of time passing’—but remains observer-mode; no contradictory impulses or micro-choice under fire. The urn shard and capsule are handled, yet the emotional jolt is reported, not embodied. Still, the perched, patient attention feels like a credible vocation, and the refusal to surrender meaning is an earned stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the capsule’s repair reframes the silo from mausoleum to beacon. The accumulative lens holds—pattern builds through garage-sale messages—though the decisive reweight is more epiphany than causal turn. Cost is conceptual but legible: the world stays broken, the keeper’s exile permanent. Orientation anchors early; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Emerald silo, cracked clock, urn shard—each re-appears with shifted charge, creating micro-setting as crucible. Descriptions are selective, filtered through the keeper’s numbed awe; sound and touch are lean but present. The capsule’s interior is withheld until the final beat, giving the repair tactile payoff. Spatial choreography is immaculate; objects never drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can meaning be re-stitched in a numberless world—stays coherent. Escalation is textural: each garage-sale message adds density, the capsule’s reveal tightens the pattern. No live option is foreclosed; risk remains intellectual rather than visceral, capping intensity. Agency is attention, not jeopardy—sufficient for accumulative mode but not grippingly costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as currency when arithmetic expires. The urn shard’s whisper and the clock’s cracked face form a quiet diptych of mortal residue. No moral is declared; the final smile is implication enough. Subtext avoids sentimentality; resonance is cerebral rather than gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect voice sustains a hushed, reverent cadence that mirrors the keeper’s suspended disbelief. Syntax elongates, then tightens, mirroring the groping for lost rhythm. Diction stays within the POV’s plausible lexicon—‘borrowed-time,’ ‘texture’—no register drift. The rhythmic control is the chief pleasure; every clause breathes like dusty air inside the silo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; each line advances image or pattern. Occasional soft repeats—‘timekeeper’s task…timekeeper’s presence…timekeeper’s journey’—mildly dull momentum but stop short of template cadence. Metaphors stay consistent (time as fabric, capsule as heart). No scaffolding obscures the final image; the prose is publish-ready with minor tightening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The post-numeric world is familiar sci-fi turf, yet the garage-sale code conceit freshens it; curator-as-diviner feels new. Risk is moderate—lyric stasis over plot—but the commitment to pattern is total. Specificity of the emerald silo and the shard’s crematory dust anchors the concept. Not wildly surprising, but the execution is confidently idiosyncratic.</comment>
