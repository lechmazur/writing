<comment>Aria’s interiority is atmospheric but vague; “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” remains a label never enacted—no diving gear, no ghost bargain, no error under pressure. The sole micro-choice—touching the globe—triggers vision rather than decision; she watches, never risking change. Motive (“salvage something pure”) is stated repeatedly yet never collides with a visible trade-off; the absence of earned cost or contradictory impulse keeps her flat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the empty globe reframes the “windows of connection” motif, and the glacier shrine’s glow provides felt cost—she leaves carrying absence. Causality, however, is loose: vision arrives because she touches, not because she chooses or errs; the because/therefore linkage is weak under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty, but the plot never tightens—each beat is another luminous tableau rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<comment>Glacial shrine, candle flicker, melting ice scent, and swirling glitter create a tight sensory micro-setting that mirrors internal thaw. Selection favors visual and thermal detail; prose wisely skips tourist catalog. The shrine itself constrains no tactical choice; it is atmosphere, not leverage, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find a fragment of truth”—stays abstract; no concrete resource is risked or foreclosed. Pressure is accumulative/textural: visions layer like translucent sheets, but each revelation is additive, not decisive. A single micro-turn occurs when the globe settles into a pattern, yet the pattern is read, not acted upon; cost remains atmospheric rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through recurring “windows” and starlight imagery; no explicit thesis is shouted. The melted globe’s final emptying reweights earlier shimmer into absence, supplying a Conceptual Repricing. Complexity is mild—no counter-readings challenge the motif—keeping the resonance competent but not acute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent frost-and-flicker cadence; filter verbs (“she felt,” “she saw”) are few and atmospheric. Diction favors soft consonants and liquid imagery, fitting dream-logic. No dialogue appears; internal voice is uniform, never cracking under stress, hence never modulating.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe in long wave-like clauses that suit dream texture; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“broken shell,” “stars on a moonless night”) flirt with purple but remain legible. No loops or scaffold detected; pronoun and tense clean. Information density is moderate—some sentences perform only atmospheric work—preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment> pairing “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” with dream-cameo forensics is fresh, yet the piece never stages either trade in scene, reducing novelty to premise. Starlight as borrowed light and the emptied snow-globe lens are lovely specificities, but the narrative stays safe—no structural risk, no rule subversion. Transformation test fails: rename Aria and the emotional arc survives unchanged.</comment>
