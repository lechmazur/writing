<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is lyric but thin: “hauntingly optimistic vision” and “pang of longing” stay abstract. The only embodied beat is needle-dancing; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Endurance is declared, not costed—no forfeiture or tool loss shown. She reads as a spiritual archetype rather than an individual whose flaws shape the weave.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing tapestry reconfigures the labyrinth from ruin to reverence, cost felt in the canyon’s hush. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light and thread shifts the stake. Causality is loose (“pattern that seemed to emerge of its own accord”), but acceptable under lyric design. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, damp-earth scent, and tide-pool cycle anchor time and place. The labyrinth is used as mirror, not constraint—no dead-end or resource scarcity affects tactics. Micro-setting is the fabric itself, which does charge the final image with inner light. Sensory selection stays biased to Aria’s poetic gaze, but spatial choreography is airy—no tactile navigation of tunnels.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“remake broken world into hope”—is stated early but abstract. Escalation is tonal intensification (glow, silence, weight) rather than option-narrowing; no visible price or trade-off shapes tactics. Agency is passive: the pattern “emerged of its own accord.” Under Accumulative lens the deepening is present, yet lacks a felt forfeiture to reach 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of art healing ruin emerges through recurrent weaving and light imagery, never sermonized. Subtext resides in silence and tide-pool cycles rather than declaration. Ambiguity is preserved: no moral verdict on whether hope is delusion. Final image reweights the illustration plate as living tapestry—an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent poetic register: “orchid solace,” “tone of orchid solace.” Syntax is varied, rhythms breathe with scene cadence. Perceptual signature is coherent—Aria sees world as fabric and light. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Information density is moderate—some sentences perform only atmospheric work. Figurative language is frequent (“needle dancing,” “fabric of solace”) but patterned, not muddled. No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“centuries-old labyrinth carved into the red canyon walls”) slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise—wharf weaver in canyon labyrinth—offers fresh synthesis of textile art and geological ruin. Transformation of illustration plate into living tapestry is an earned inflection, not gimmick. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation replaces causal plot. Voice and setting feel specific enough to resist name-swap test; emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
