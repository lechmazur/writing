<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia is stated, not embodied; no late-night bodily cost or hallucination sharpens the obsession. The “wryly earnest” tag is repeated but never dramatized in a choice that costs him anything. The final decision to embed the brooch in the artwork is logical but feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled out of contradictory impulses; we see no moment where he almost destroys or sells it. Interiority stays safely therapeutic (“process the trauma”) instead of fracturing under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the brooch becomes paint, reframing the island’s history with the felt cost of forever fusing relic to canvas. Causality is loose—rain-trail decoding and wall-markings are more accumulative pattern than because/therefore chain—but the lens holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One soft spot: the stranger’s info-dump on “convergence caused the wars” is off-stage backstory retro-injected, slightly diluting the decisive change’s punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perpetual gloom, crumbling concrete, salt-stung air, and moonlit amber give tactile specificity without tourist clutter. The tidal island’s wet ruin constrains movement—underground tunnels flood, rain reveals code—so setting actively shapes the search. Micro-setting (half-buried brooch, wet sand, paint-slick fingers) charges the final image when the object is pressed into pigment. A half-point off for one generic “overgrown streets” placeholder that could be any apocalypse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from ruins—signals early and tightens once: the brooch must be decoded or the obsession stays hollow. However, escalation is mostly informational (each clue simply adds lore) rather than option-closing; no rainstorm traps him, no rival claimant threatens, no sleepless hallucination forces a false reading. The exchange with the stranger is the single beat that forecloses secrecy, but the price paid (one painting) feels light. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—art as fossilization of cataclysm—emerges cleanly when relic becomes pigment, letting the canvas outlast the body. Subtext flirts with warning against excavating wounds, yet the stranger’s war-origin exposition states too much. The brooch’s shift from mystery to medium is elegant, but the wars stay abstract, blunting resonance. Still, the final image avoids moralizing and lets silence speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a painterly perceptual filter—light “dances across” amber, rain “reveals hidden patterns.” Syntax loosens under fatigue, mirroring insomnia without gimmick. No dialogue, so no register clash. One filter-verb cluster (“I began to feel… began to notice…”) slightly dulls immediacy, but voice stays coherent and distinct to the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (“The rain had a way of revealing hidden patterns and exposing secrets”). No scaffolding loops or synonym churn. A single mixed metaphor (“fabric of reality…torn asunder” alongside “trail of anomalies”) is forgivable at closure distance. Otherwise clean, vivid, and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal ruin + insomniac painter + amber anomaly remixes familiar eco-gothic tropes, but the final gesture—turning relic into paint—gives a fresh, medium-specific twist. Convergence as war-catalyst is abstract, not materially new. Specificity of rain-trail decoding and brooch-in-canvas saves the piece from template mediocrity, but it never fully escapes the shadow of McCarthy-style apocalypse nostalgia.</comment>
