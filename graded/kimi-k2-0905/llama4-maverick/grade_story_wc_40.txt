<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—“eyes… red-rimmed from lack of sleep,” ink-stained fingers drumming—but the scholar’s contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted in scene; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized before the summons. The final resolve is credible yet abstract, cost hinted but not viscerally felt. Voice is specific; motivation remains steady; meets default scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal’s glint reframes the scholar’s stance, surrendering seclusion with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world… ready to listen”). Causal chain is thin—summons arrives ex machina—but the accumulative pattern of silence → testimony holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn is rendered through selective sensory strokes—dust, parchment odor, glinting crystal—each filtering the scholar’s priorities. The crystal serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its falling “click” reweights the hush. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode growth pattern vs. exposure through testimony—is signaled early and tightens once: secrecy must be relinquished. Agency is largely reactive (summons), yet the scholar’s decision to rise and clutch the crystal crystallizes stance with visible cost under situational pressure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span; coincidence complicates rather than resolves. Persistent constraint (world unraveling) shadows the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge versus communication emerges through image pattern—silent hush vs. amplifying crystal—never abstractly stated. Final glow on the crystal reprises dawn light, reconfiguring meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hooded visitor’s unspoken threat and the scholar’s wordless compliance. Complexity is embraced: testimony may scatter as well as share truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is steady, syntactically varied, rhythm breathing with scene shifts—long sentences for suspended hush, staccato for approaching steps. Perceptual signature is scholar-specific: marginalia, ink dust, pattern hunger. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction remains within reticent academic lexicon. Crystal’s “sonically reflective” trait is smoothly woven without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence layers atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “staccato rhythm” is apt, not cliché. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes resolve through crystal glow. High information density achieved without overwriting; punctuation and tense immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Post-dictionary world and sonically reflective crystal offer fresh inflections on archive-futurism; scholar forced to voice silent research is familiar but re-weighted through sensory specificity. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Transformation test: crystal and hush are inseparable from this narrative fabric. Avoids derivative echo; premise commits fully.</comment>
