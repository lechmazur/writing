<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aria’s “fault-tolerant” nature is shown, not labeled: she tolerates ambiguity by physically re-writing the logbook, a micro-choice that costs her standing with the staff. The swallowed-truth motive stays live—every smudge is a probe whose price is social friction. Interiority stays concrete (“shoulders ease,” “fever fog”) and degrades under noetic strain. The ending renunciation—leaving with only a “smudged” memory—pays the cost, earning stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated logbook marginalia tighten the weave until the final “smudged” auroral image reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mountain mist and the vanished oracle reprice truth as provisional. The cost is legible in the final sentence—her “faintest hint” is an erasure she accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alpine station is handled as tool, not backdrop: the metal grating underfoot, ozone in nostrils, and humming servers constrain movement and attention. The botanical illustration recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image; its rarity parallels the oracle’s own bloom under adverse conditions. Weather is not scenery—it is the data she vandalizes. Spatial choreography stays clean across deck, interior, logbook wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Aria surface a truth without breaking the station’s epistemic frame? Escalation is textural: each marginal smudge increases social tension and semantic instability until the only option is departure—an earned forfeiture. No coin-flip rescue; the mist simply reclaims her. Cost is visible: she abandons the community whose data she defaced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern: truth is not extracted but smudged into being. The alpine flower image reconfigures from pretty print to emblem of fragile epistemology at closure. No explicit thesis; the final “auroral sorrow” is felt through image, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: is her tolerance a gift or a contamination? The story refuses to arbitrate, honoring its own lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a perceptual signature tuned to atmospherics and data haze. Syntax breathes—long clauses for fog, abrupt fragments for fever break. “Smudged, like a charcoal drawing” is a metaphor that pays off the logbook action. No head-hopping; station staff remain opaque mirrors, sharpening Aria’s isolate lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence can layer weather, body, and epistemic breach. Rhythm modulates with pressure—no template cadence. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she knew”) appear but never in peak beats. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line is crisp, letting mist perform closure work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: data oracle + romantic mountain science + marginalia vandalism. The “fault-tolerant” frame is repurposed from engineering to epistemic ethics. Risk—the almost plotless lyric accretion—pays off in the charged vanishing. Not wholly unprecedented, but the alpine flower–data blot fusion feels singular.</comment>
