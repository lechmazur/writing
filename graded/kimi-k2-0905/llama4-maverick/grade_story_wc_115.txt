<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but generically “explorer-curious”; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The beaded wheel is fingered, yet never alters tactics or stakes; same for the logbook. Religious skepticism is declared, never pressure-tested. Closure is a feeling of clarity without a visible forfeiture—cost is asserted, not embodied—so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is thin: finding the wheel → hearing radio → finding logbook → feeling satisfied. No micro-choice reverses direction or forecloses an option; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Closure is “a feeling of clarity” without on-page Decisive Change or visible cost, so lens reads Situational but lands as mood rather than reweighted stance. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory triage favors rust, decay, radio static—selective and POV-colored, not catalogue. Tunnel geometry stays consistent; no floating rooms. Beaded valve wheel serves as micro-setting/object recurrence but never constrains a final choice, blocking 9-band. Idiom is controlled; no anachronism. Strong atmospheric specificity even while plot remains static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—stated early yet never sharpened into tangible risk or trade-off. Pressure is ambient (dark, decay, watched feeling) but does not escalate; options don’t narrow. Absent antagonist or credible loss, tension is flat-line. Closure image is internal satisfaction, not a priced choice, so escalation never lands a cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of residual industrial memory emerges through texture, not thesis. Subtext is strongest in radio hush after confession, hinting communal guilt. Final clarity feels convenient because no prior moral/ethical friction was staged. Insight is asserted (“the weight… reveal itself”) rather than reweighted by image or forfeiture, capping resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; no head-hop. Perceptual signature relies on decay-cataloguing verbs (“crept,” “clung”) and auditory focus (radio static, heartbeat), giving a rhythmic pulse. Free indirect style is clean; no filter overload. Dialogue absent—no violation. Voice texture consistent if slightly perfume-adjacent; maintains drowsy cadence that matches tone goal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean, varied sentence openers, strong sensory nouns. Occasional flourish density (“morbid perfume,” “staccato beat”) but never clouds causality. No loops or paraphrase stacks; no mixed metaphors. One soft scaffold: “they felt a sense… wash over them” used twice; mild, doesn’t touch closure. Prose is publish-ready at line level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fusion of psychic radio + ghost-shift + valve wheel is fresh, yet each element stays ornamental rather than rule-changing. Decay-tunnel is familiar backdrop; explorer archetype defaults to curious-skeptic template. No risky structural or perspectival move. Specificity of beaded industrial wheel stands out; story doesn’t mine its possible mechanical past. Sufficiently particular to avoid cliché but not transformative.</comment>
