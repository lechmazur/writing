<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chronicler’s interiority is vivid—"I was getting jealous of my past selves"—but no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the arc is purely reflective, so the final “peace” feels declared rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll glows, reweighting the premise. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and while the pattern of dream-bleed is taught early, the single tightening (jealousy → creative fire) is only asserted, not shown to foreclose any live option with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cabin and scroll function as micro-setting; the birch bark’s tactile presence recurs and charges the final image. Sparse sensory range (mostly visual) and generic “woods” keep it from constraining any choice, but the object-as-setting satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn feral nostalgia into narrative—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via dream density, yet no middle beat narrows options or exacts a price; the creative act itself never faces a trade-off, so escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: art transmutes irretrievable loss into usable meaning. The final glow of the scroll reweights prior images without moralizing, but the insight is single-note; no counter-readings or moral friction complicate the consolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is consistent, with patterned repetition (“I felt… I was…”) that teaches its meditative cadence. Perceptual signature—selective attention to scroll, dream blur, and jealousy—remains character-specific; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid yet loops (“The feeling was… I couldn’t shake…”) and stacks filter verbs that dull immediacy. Metaphors (“maelstrom,” “kaleidoscope”) are stock; no mixed vehicles, but the cadence never accelerates under pressure, keeping density moderate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Premise—lucid-dream chronicler distills nostalgia on birch bark—is fresh, yet the execution drifts into generic dream-lit tropes. The scroll’s reprise provides a memorable image, but the plot could transplant to any writer’s journal without structural change.</comment>
