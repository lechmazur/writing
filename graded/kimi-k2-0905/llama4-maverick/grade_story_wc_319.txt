<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is lyrically voiced but remains abstract—“dimensional homesickness,” “friends with uncertainty”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that dramatizes the shift from burden to acceptance. The pendant’s glow is registered, never handled in a way that reveals hierarchy of values; the beat of “closed her eyes…let the mist seep” is the only visible action, too late to earn the final poise. No persistent flaw or cost is legible on-page; the emotional arc is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant glows, mist reclaims her, stance crystallizes. Causality is lyric-accumulative: mist thickens → visions → re-perception → poise; linkage is atmospheric, not beat-by-beat. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens contradiction. However, the decisive reconfiguration relies on visionary summary rather than a tangible cost or constraint shown to alter tactics, keeping it below 7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen garden, statues, pendant, and fog function as micro-setting: the statues’ shifting expressions and the pendant’s answering pulse tether the metaphysical turn to concrete objects. Sensory detail is selective—smell of decay, lunar glow—filtered through the guardian’s melancholy gaze. Environment never constrains physical choice, but the pendant’s glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding library secrets vs. longing for uncertainty—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via atmospheric density: mist thickens, statues grin, whispers reveal secrets. The tightening is a perceptual shift, not an option-foreclosing choice; no visible price is exacted. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but lacks a tangible trade-off to reach 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through imagistic progression—grinning statues become serene, pendant shifts from trophy to key—without moralizing. Subtext resides in the inversion of light/dark boundaries. Final glow reweights prior motifs, offering resonant ambiguity. The absence of a dramatized cost keeps it from higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains foggy lucidity: curling mist, macabre grins, lunar glow. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly archaic diction suits guardian’s timeless stance. No dialogue, no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression in visionary sequence is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no synonym loops, no template cadence. Figurative layering—“damp shroud,” “ethereal tentacles”—is dense yet coherent under lyric mode. One mixed metaphor (“interiorize exteriors”) is abstract but fits accumulative lens. Final image is uncluttered, allowing 9-band consideration; minor density keeps it mid-7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Frozen occult library garden is fresh; “feral guardian” and “dimensional homesickness” tilt the trope. Conceptual turn—uncertainty as ally rather than enemy—reframes gothic stewardship. Execution relies on atmospheric accretion rather than surprising action, limiting memorability. Risk is moderate, successful within lyric mode.</comment>
