<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaito’s interiority is vivid—his gaze “slices through pretense” and the brain-jar watches him—yet the emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized: we are told “a surge of determination” instead of seeing micro-choices that cost him. The ego-death backstory is asserted, not tested in scene, so the turn from numbness to felt aliveness is declared, not embodied. The clone-custody stakes never materialize as on-page pressure; the brain remains a static symbol rather than a crucible that forces a forked decision. Earned stasis is claimed (“he was free”) but no path is foreclosed on the page, blunting the closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaito leaves the dojo “fully alive,” a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the identity crisis. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through mirrored imagery (brain / self) until a cadence shift releases tension. Causality is soft; the meditation practice is named but never shows a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Cost is felt but diffuse; the final peace is stated more than paid for with a concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is sketched with economy—levitation hum, isolation, shelf with jar—anchoring who/where by sentence three. Sensory fidelity is narrow and POV-true: Kaito notices only what challenges his self-concept. The jar’s recurrence recharges the final image, passing the 9+ gate for micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus; meditation deepens but never threatens failure or demands trade-off. No visible price is exacted; the practice succeeds without complication, so tension is atmospheric rather than tactical. The history-rewriting world remains a decorative backdrop; it complicates nothing on-stage. Escalation is present only as density increase under Accumulative lens, lacking a tightening that forecloses an option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—identity exceeds genetic origin—emerges through the brain-jar motif’s final fade, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. No explicit moral is stated; resonance is left implicit. The clone-custody concept is named but never dramatized, so thematic complexity is asserted, not tested. Subtext is thin; the brain stares, but never forces a morally charged choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Kaito’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Voice texture is calm-philosophic, fitting a meditative frame, with controlled repetition (“more than just a duplicate…more than just a copy”) that teaches its pattern early. Syntax remains stable; no filter-verb bloat. Diction stays within the plausible lexicon of a reflective martial artist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the meditation cadence; sentence variety is good, but three consecutive sentences open with “As he…” creating a template cadence that dulls peak pressure. No mixed metaphors or strained figures. Information density is moderate; some lines summarize (“the world below continued to change”) instead of vivifying. No loops or typos; copy is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo plus clone-brain combo freshens the standard enlightenment tale; the setting literalizes “elevated practice.” Conceptual risk—history rewriting itself—remains off-stage ornament rather than plot engine, slightly hedging boldness. Specific detail (levitation engines’ soft hum) keeps the speculative element tactile. Overall, a thoughtful synthesis rather than a radical departure.</comment>
