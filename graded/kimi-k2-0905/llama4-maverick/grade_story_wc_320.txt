<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria’s “celestial signal interpreter” tag is never embodied—no tool, no jargon, no sensory signature of her gift. Interiority floats in generic wonder (“serenely electric”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. The only micro-choice—stooping for the star fragment—reads as pre-ordained, not pressured. No contradiction or visible cost forecloses her path; she simply receives epiphanies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: repeated motifs (star shard, hush, moonlight) accrue symbolic weight until the final “gateway” reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; spatial logic holds. Causality, however, is loose—revelations arrive via atmospheric osmosis rather than because/therefore links. Closure lands as Charged Poise, but the cost is abstract (“wonder and awe”) rather than lived or irreversible.</comment>

<comment>City-over-gorge is vivid in one brushstroke; radio towers supply sonic texture. Yet the towers never constrain movement or supply hazard; they serve as mood furniture. The Hollywood fragment earns micro-setting status by re-appearing at closure, giving it 9-gate credit. Ozone-and-decay is sensory but static; no environmental detail later alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“uncover the hidden truth”—stays atmospheric; no concrete obstacle opposes Aria. Pressure escalates only via lyric accumulation: each motif returns with heavier adjectives. The single tightening is the discovery of the wall message, but it presents answers rather than narrowing options. Cost is purely affective; nothing is risked, forfeited, or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty-in-decay emerges through recurring imagery rather than authorial lecture. Final “beginning in every ending” line flirts with thematic echo but is saved by its placement as internal paraphrase, not moral. Subtext is thin; nothing contradicts or complicates the decay-as-wonder premise. The star fragment’s reprise gives a modest re-weighting, supplying enough resonance for mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a dreamy cadence with moderate rhythmic variety. Filter verbs (“she felt”) intrude but remain sparse. Diction stays within pop-mystical register, consistent with Aria’s consciousness. No dialogue, so voice distinction defaults to internal texture—pleasant but not sharply particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, but metaphor density climbs toward purple in the final third (“symphony,” “threads of reality,” “veil of perception”) without pattern justification. Several sentences repeat the same abstract nominal structure (“she felt… she knew… she saw”). No scaffolding loops or typos; clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet risks monotony from cumulative anaphora.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Atmospheric ruin + celestial linguist is fresh, but the execution drifts toward familiar New-Age imagery. The “shard of hush” concept is evocative yet remains abstract, never crystallizing into a rule the reader can test. Risk level is moderate; no structural experiment. The synthesis feels pleasant rather than inevitable, capping originality just above median.</comment>
