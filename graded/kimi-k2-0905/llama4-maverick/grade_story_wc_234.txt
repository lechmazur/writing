<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The alchemist’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never collides with a contradictory impulse; she moves from wonder to wonder without risk or loss. No micro-choice on the page actually costs her anything, so the ending’s “satisfaction” feels unearned. The whispered phrase acts as an external injection of motive rather than an internal fracture. Result: a pleasant observer, not a pressured character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Closure is present as a soft Charged Poise, but the lens wobbles: early text promises causal inquiry yet slides into accumulative lyricism without teaching the shift. The nautilus reveals patterns, yet nothing is foreclosed—no datum falsified, no hypothesis abandoned—so the conceptual cost is too diffuse. “Density of presence” remains abstract; the final image does not reweight prior stakes. Orientation holds, but the causal chain is slack.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory triad—ember glow, salt breeze, rustling grass—anchors every beat and filters through the POV’s scientific-romantic gaze. The shell’s spiral is re-examined under shifting light, so the micro-setting (object-as-setting) evolves and charges the closing smile. Spatial choreography is clean; only two bodies share the frame. Meets the 9+ gate: the shell’s changing illumination directly shapes the final perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stake is announced as “unlock secrets” but never tightens: each observation simply confirms beauty without falsifying a theory or costing a resource. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the shell cooperates the moment she looks “differently.” Pressure is ambient, not adversarial. Escalation plateaus at wonder; the whispered phrase complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of revaluing through recursive attention emerges implicitly via the shell’s spiral and the returning light. Subtext is thin—friends’ whisper functions as authorial cue rather than layered silence. No moral is stated, yet the insight never transcends the initial premise. Ambivalence is absent; the takeaway is a single-note affirmation of curiosity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent: “scientifically romantic intensity” blends lexicons without jarring leaps. Rhythm modulates—long lyric sentences breathe, then contract at the whisper. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are few and voice-motivated. POV distance stays tight; no head-hop. Distinctive perceptual signature evident, but peaks at admiration rather than stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud clean, but figuration repeats (“glowed softly…warm orange light danced…ember nexus pulsed and glowed”) in adjacent sentences, creating paraphrase loops. No mixed metaphors, yet density drifts toward purple in the final third. Scaffolding phrases (“in that moment,” “as she worked”) recur. Closure image is clear, so cap −0.6 for ornament accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemist-scientist with pocket-sun tech gives fresh tilt, but the nautilus-as-wisdom-icon is familiar. “Returning differently” as method is conceptual, not dramatized, so the twist feels intellectual rather than experiential. Risk level is moderate; execution safe. Specificity of ember-nexus light almost compensates for the template spiral metaphor.</comment>
