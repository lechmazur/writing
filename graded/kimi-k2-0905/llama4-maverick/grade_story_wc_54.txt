<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity and engineer mindset are sketched early, but internal contradiction is only asserted (“equations for hope” vs. abandonment) never dramatized. No micro-choice shows her creativity functioning under pressure; the pipe rerouting is reported, not struggled through. The sextant piece never alters her decisions on-page, so motivation stays ornamental. Cost is gestured at (“she would always carry the lessons”) but not paid in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: terminal hums alive, Maya walks away charged with purpose, the image of “beacon” reprices her trek. Causal track holds: sextant find → pattern reading → pipe reroute → life support restart. Escalation is light (one reported success) but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final cadence shift lands. Orientation within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is conceptual (spent night, glow as proof) not visceral, so holds at 7.2 rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Terminal’s rusting valves and dust motes are filtered through engineer eyes, providing tactile micro-setting that later enables the resurrection act. Spatial choreography stays crisp: she “steps into” halls, “eyes landed on pipes,” no floating bodies. Sensory economy matches stakes—visual, metallic, hiss—without museum tour. Setting constrains the final solution (pipes = infrastructure) so earns 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“equations for hope” versus dereliction—is signaled early. Pressure is situational: the maze of patterns + decayed life-support create coherent threat. One meaningful tightening: realization pipes can restart air. No loss or trade-off appears on-page; success feels frictionless. Escalation stays conceptual rather than visceral, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebirth-through-ingenuity emerges from concrete restoration rather than sermon, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit thesis (“a new equation for hope”). Subtext is thin; symbols (maze, sextant) don’t gain new weight at end. Resonance is pleasant yet generic—any derelict space could substitute. The image of glowing terminal reconfigures meaning, but the conceptual cost is mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature is engineer-filtered (“intricate mechanisms,” “redirected flows”). Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences early, shorter pulsing clauses during pipe work. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Occasional elevated phrases (“ethereal light on the maze”) flirt with register drift but stay within lyrical allowance. Patterned repetition of “equations for hope” is purposeful, not algorithmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; only minor paraphrase loops (“abandoned… abandonment”) and two instances of “began to” scaffolding. Figurative language stays sparse, so no density penalty. Sentence variety is good, paragraph cuts clean. Opening and closing images anchor the arc. A few filler modifiers (“soft glow,” “gentle hiss”) could be traded for stronger nouns, keeping score just above mid-7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combo of derelict spaceport + living infrastructure-maze is fresh, yet execution leans on familiar “lone genius revives ruin” template. Sextant-as-key is under-exploited; no celestial navigation metaphor pays off. Stakes remain local, so risk is modest. Specific engineer details (valves, flow equations) supply freshness, lifting score above median.</comment>
