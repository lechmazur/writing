<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority hovers in generalized, therapeutic language (“weight of her past bearing down,” “jaded wonder”) rather than idiosyncratic, body-level perception. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; memory-erasure backstory is told, not dramatized, so the micro-choice that could foreclose a path never arrives. The signed baseball is fondled but never tests or changes her stance; empathy remains an asserted goal, not an earned cost. She exits the scene essentially unchanged, so the required Earned Stasis/Charged Poise is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure attempt: “Charged Poise” via the mist-veiled path and glowing ball. The image is atmospheric but lacks a concrete, felt cost—she simply “disappears” with the same determination she arrived with. Causal chain is loose: the newspaper clue leads her here, but the ball does not trigger a decision that narrows or re-prices her options; it merely accompanies her. Orientation is clear by 120 w; no lens contradiction, hence no Orientation penalty, yet the final beat does not reweight the premise, keeping the score shy of 7+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground lake is vividly sketched—glow, mist, dripping heartbeat—supplying an otherworldly micro-setting that charges mood. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the path appears as the mist clears, guiding her next step. However, the environment never actively constrains her movement or alters tactical choices; it’s backdrop, not crucible. Because the setting fails the 9+ gate (no final-image constraint), it caps below 8.8 despite strong atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—empathy quest—is declared early but remains abstract; no visible price is attached at any beat. Pressure plateaus: the lake is wondrous but presents no escalating obstacle, ticking clock, or traded-off choice. The baseball could have forced a decision (keep/throw/offer) yet remains inert; thus escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is weak. Closure does not tighten or foreclose; cost is only rhetorical, capping the score below 6.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-through-dimness is introduced via epigraphic newspaper line and reiterated in final paragraph, but the narrative never dramatizes an empathic test or failure. The baseball’s “JT – Time Traveler” signature hints at subtext about cross-time connection, yet this potential irony is left dormant. No particular is reweighted at the end; the lake simply glows brighter. The concept is coherent but relies on repeated assertion rather than earned resonance, preventing 7+ lift.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lush but slides into poetic generics (“ethereal glow,” “labyrinth of choices”) that feel slightly processed rather than character-specific. Rhythm is fluid, with purposeful breath-length paragraphing that supports Accumulative/Textural lens. No experimental compression or pattern-teaching, so ceiling is competent rather than distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence openings vary. Figurative language leans atmospheric but stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. However, several near-duplicate phrases (“bioluminescent glow,” “otherworldly light”) and scaffold sentences (“As she walked…”) create mild paraphrase loops. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. No artifacts touch the closing image, so penalties stay minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Memory-wipe seeker + bioluminescent under-lake + time-travel baseball is an intriguing synthesis, avoiding stock cyber-noir. Yet the elements remain conceptually decorative; the baseball’s temporal tag is never exploited, and the lake’s biology is undisrupted, so the combo feels fresh but under-explored. Risk is present (quiet surreal quest instead of action plot) and coherence holds, meriting a modest lift above mid-band.</comment>
