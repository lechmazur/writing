<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but generic; the registrar’s “pondering the weight of honesty” is told, not embodied. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—she simply walks, looks, and feels resolve. The lens and tickets are handled, yet never force a micro-choice that costs her anything. Closure is a declared freedom, not one paid for by dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated images of crystal, rain, lens, and doodles deepen the stake of transparency. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lens lifted to eye, world “transformed”—but the cost is only asserted (“mistrust melted”) rather than shown. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks, yet no tightening beat narrows options. One shard, single POV, within word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt, wet stone, star-reflecting monolith supply tactile, selective detail. Rain-washed city and “resonant hush” create a coherent acoustic envelope. The lens functions as micro-setting, guiding her gaze and final image. Environment never actively constrains or endangers her, capping short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transparency vs mistrust—is signaled early. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: no opposing force or trade-off appears. The only escalation is her deciphering more doodles while walking; no option is foreclosed, no price exacted. Closure feels affirmative but not earned through a costly turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty-as-liberation emerges through imagery rather than sermon. Final image reframes the lens from relic to tool, offering quiet conceptual repricing. Yet the absence of dramatized risk keeps the insight lightweight. Subtext is present but thin—no competing value complicates the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hushed, crystalline cadence that matches setting. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition (“the registrar…”) mimicking ritual movement. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. POV stays tight to registrar’s perception; perceptual signature is consistent if somewhat ethereal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly dense; occasional soft fillers (“a sense of resolve wash over her”) could be trimmed. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Register stays elevated but coherent with tone. Final lens image lands with clarity, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>City-whispering via discarded concert doodles is a fresh conceit. Crystal forecourt after rain feels like a repurposed plaza, not a stock locale. Yet the arc—object prompts epiphany—is familiar lyric structure, and no counterforce surprises. Specificity of detail lifts it above template, but risk level is modest.</comment>
