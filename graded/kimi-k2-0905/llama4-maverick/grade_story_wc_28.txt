<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aria’s interior contradiction—tenderness vs. “arms of steel”—is embodied in the tessera squeeze and the renaming act; the “warm coldness” is felt rather than labelled. Motivation stays legible: salvage compassion from ruins. No second character on page, so status/relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation (accepting perpetual grief-watch) is earned by the retrocognitive cost she pays on the chipped stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaza’s renaming crystallizes her stewardship, cost paid by the retrocognitive grief-flash. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each mosaic fragment layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation clean by word 50. No causal break; ellipsis between “she began to walk” → “until she came to a stop” is motivated by her search for the stepping stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ancient plaza, shattered sky, and the tessera itself function as micro-setting that constrains her choice to rename rather than rebuild. Chipped stepping stone is tactile anchor for the retrocognitive beat. Sensory hierarchy服从Aria’s grief-filter: colour fragments blaze against ash. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rubble heap to stone centre.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she resurrect empathy without being immolated by memory? Pressure escalates via retrocognitive immersion—each tessera flash narrows her options, forcing the renaming act as defence against being trapped forever. Cost is visceral: she shoulders the plaza’s grief. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her handling of the tessera.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “aberrant mercy” as both wound and tool—no moralizing, only the final image of her whispered name hanging in cold air. Recurring mosaic motif reweights from souvenir to scar to seed. No platitudes; insight is earned through the retrocognitive price she pays.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug in Aria’s perceptual bandwidth; no head-hop. Diction—“retrocognitively trapped,” “warm coldness”—is POV-plausible mystic idiom. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for memory bursts, truncated fragments for the renaming beat. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between lyrical elongation and stark declaratives, mirising grief-pulse. No loops or synonym churn; “shattered sky” appears once and sticks. One mixed metaphor—“echoes of her words faded” paired with air vibration—minor, doesn’t obscure closure. High density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic labour.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic plaza+cognitive relic is fresh synthesis; “aberrant mercy” as operative concept avoids stock hope tropes. Risk: lyric retrocognition could feel device-y, but the cost is dramatized bodily. Final reconfiguration feels specific to this tessera, this plaza—swapping names would break the resonance.</comment>
