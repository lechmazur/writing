<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s curiosity is stated but never tested by an external dilemma; interiority stays at “morbid curiosity” and “shuddered” without bodily specificity. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—the voice simply obeys the whispering advisor—so the final paralysis feels administered rather than earned. The photographically-cursed vision never confronts the narrator with a live choice, so the arc is observation, not change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure is a blackout followed by a shrug: “I knew that I would never forget” states cost but does not show a foreclosed path or stance shift under any lens. Causality is talk-and-then: the advisor whispers, the narrator obeys, mirror appears, figure glows—no narrowing of options or knowledge change. Orientation is clear early, but the ending drifts into portent without reconfiguring stakes, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Funhouse atmosphere is vivid—decay, cracked mirror, pulsing clasp—yet description seldom constrains action; the clasp glints but is never manipulated. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting never becomes a tool that alters tactics. The final image needs the mirror/clasp to charge the moment, so the 9+ gate is missed but atmospheric work is solid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—remains abstract; no concrete test or trade-off materializes. Escalation is atmospheric only: fog lifts, glow brightens, figure appears—no decision narrows options. The narrator’s agency is passive observation, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is asserted (“I felt changed”) but not dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of image-as-trap emerges through poster, mirror, photograph, but remains conceptual; no paradox or fresh angle complicates it. Subtext is limited because the narrator’s fear is never contradicted or deepened. The ending’s “siren’s call” reprise is a nakedly thematic echo rather than a reweighted image. Insight stays at prompt level: images can possess—never questioned or deepened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>First-person voice keeps consistent Gothic register, but cadence turns hypnotic and repetitive (“whispering advisor’s voice” recycles 8×). Diction is atmospheric yet drains specificity under pressure; clauses like “repulsive allure” name effect rather than render it. No dialogue, so no voice distinction test. Internal texture coherent but monotonous; no psychic-distance modulation at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is steady but template-like: many “I [verb]ed, and…” openings; three adjacent sentences start “The whispering advisor’s voice…” near climax. Figurative language is serviceable but occasionally mixed (“vortex” of luminance). No mechanical errors, yet information density dips in corridor wandering. Scaffolding phrases (“it was then that,” “as I did”) pad immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Carnival-mirror curse is familiar; the photographically-cursed model adds a half-twist but stays spectral rather than specific. Dream-dictionary paradox notes are the freshest ingredient yet remain undiscovered—no sample paradox appears on page. Risk is atmospheric, not structural; follows linear haunt arc without reframing the trope. Necessary particulars (clasp, luminance) feel checklist-selected rather than organic invention.</comment>
