<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cartographer’s motive—curiosity about “what walls dream”—remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice shows why THIS question burns. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“a world that was both fragile and resilient”) rather than charged, sensory thought. The only action is rewinding film; no counter-impulse or visible cost attaches to that beat, so the ending’s acceptance feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the cartographer left behind a piece of themselves” reweights legacy from burden to gift, with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo/mapping deepens across paragraphs, final cadence crystallizes. Orientation Test waived—disorientation early (shadowy corridor, unnamed time) pays off in final charged image. One causality slip: diaries appear in cold hearth without prior cue, but this does not break overall linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Ivy-veiled passage” recurs like a pulse, charging both atmosphere and metaphor; its final reprise anchors the closing image. Selective sensory triage—crumbling plaster, cold hearth—guides attention without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography stays clean across corridor, chamber, fireplace moves. At 800 words, no single object actively constrains choice; thus 9+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve crumbling estate memory—emerges late, signaled only after film/diaries discovered; earlier tension is diffuse. One meaningful tightening: half-burned diaries force cartographer to shoulder storyteller role, narrowing options from observer to keeper. Cost is conceptual (lifetime stewardship) rather than tangible; price legible but not viscerally felt on page. Agency remains observational; no irrevocable act forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as living echo—emerges through recurrence of “echo,” “corridor,” “veil,” never named in thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: rewinding film = vow to keep lost voices alive. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance floats in “forever linked to the ivy-veiled passage.” Some abstraction (“fragile and resilient world”) edges toward pseudo-profundity, keeping score below 8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at consistent distance; perceptual signature filters every detail through cartographer’s cartographic eye (“mapping,” “echo,” “passage”). Sentence rhythm swells and contracts with emotional cadence, no drumbeat pattern. No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“seemed to grow darker”) they serve atmosphere, not dilution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density: single sentences carry double duty—”yellowed film negative strip” reveals object, age, discovery method. No paraphrase loops; each mention of ivy/passage adds new shade. Metaphors stay coherent (“ivy-veiled” sustained without mixed vehicle). Minor scaffolding: repeated “it seemed” softens authority four times; none sit in closure beat, so 9+ still possible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh angle: climate-gothic archive story told by corridor-acoustics cartographer—occupational specificity grants instant novelty. Trope of found diaries is retooled through sonic mapping metaphor, not mere relic hunt. Risk resides in static, solitary POV; gamble pays off via accumulative lyricism. Not quite transformative—plot skeleton could transplant to another ruined manor—so holds below 8.5.</comment>
