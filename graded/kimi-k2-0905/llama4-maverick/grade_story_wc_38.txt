<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s calm-defiance motive is declared repeatedly but never tested by an opposing force; the dice and journal are handled, yet no contradictory impulse forces her to risk anything, so the “earned” quality feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dice glow, the door opens, and the web/image reweights her stance with felt cost; causality is thin—no concrete obstacle is overcome—but the lyric pattern holds and the lens (Accumulative) is coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Salt-and-rust sensory cues are selective; the sunken lab stays a backdrop rather than a constraint, yet the spider-web micro-setting directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (escape, encrypt vulnerability) but never narrowed by a live threat or trade-off; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical, so escalation reads as mood accumulation rather than option reduction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting vulnerability into strength emerges through recurring web/dice imagery; it avoids moralizing, yet the lack of external resistance keeps the thematic tension intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice stays stable, with rhythmic repetition that mirrors dance; diction remains within Aria’s perceptual range, and no head-hopping occurs, giving the prose a distinct, consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, but repeated abstract phrasing (“sense of mysterious familiarity,” “calm defiance”) creates scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors, yet density dips when emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Code-breaking dancer in a flooded lab is fresh; hangman’s dice as fate-keys and spider-web countdown give specific texture, though the escape arc itself follows a familiar lyric-rise template without surprise reversals.</comment>
