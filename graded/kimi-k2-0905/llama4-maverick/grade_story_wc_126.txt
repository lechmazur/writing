<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The violinist’s want—“a glimmer of hope” and “beauty in the unfinished”—is declared, never dramatized through contradiction or forfeiture; her single micro-choice (playing) merely enacts the premise rather than testing it. Interiority floats in lyrical labels (“raw and honest”) instead of embodied, time-bound thought, so the change feels symbolically bestowed, not earned. Because the bowl is the only tangible extension of her motive, and she never risks or relinquishes anything for it, the arc lands as soft-focus tableau, not crucible. No cost is legible on the page, so Earned Stasis/Charged Poise criteria are unmet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the music “unbinds” the chronic hush and the elderly woman’s hand-grasp reweights community, so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and an RR is legible with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early (“aftermath of the rainforest’s fiery demise”) and anchors spatially by word 50; disorientation is functional at closure, so no penalty. However, the causal chain from object ﬁnd → storytelling → communal quiet → unbinding is asserted, not demonstrated; the greenhouse and shipwrecks never limit or enable tactics, so the tightening is poetic, not mechanical. Thus the RR lands, but without persistent constraint or price shaping tactics, it stays short of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” is vivid, idiosyncratic, and returns in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate (environment charges closure). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: acoustically attuned violinist notes hush, echo, crackle of fire. Spatial choreography is clean—ash ground, glass panes, bonfire circle—tracking bodies without drift. One minor slip: “decaying wood” scent is listed among visual cues rather than filtering through her sound-oriented bias, but this does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished”—is signaled early; escalation is an accumulative deepening: chronic hush → communal storytelling → music release, each layer adding density rather than narrowing options. Agency is present (she enters, sits, plays) but no credible loss or tool forfeiture occurs; the unbinding is symbolic, not tactical. Therefore cost is legible as atmospheric shift, not visible price, capping entry to the 7-band. No reversal or trade-off is forced upon her, so pressure coheres but stays soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty amid ruin, art as communal repair. Subtext lives in gesture—bowl passed hand-to-hand, music braided with stories—never sermonized. The final image (stars, blooming scent) reweights “unfinished” from defect to living process, achieving CR without moral tag. One soft spot: the phrase “magnificent simplicity” itself appears, a mild Thematic Echo, but it is embedded in POV reflection rather than tacked-on thesis, limiting deduction to −0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to the violinist’s acoustic bias; perceptual signature is consistent (echo, vibration, hush). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under musical crescendo, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; occasional elevated cadence (“morbid perfume,” “celestial map”) reads as lyrical heightening rather than drift, supporting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, image-driven, almost every sentence layered (sound + emotion + metaphor). No loops, paraphrase, or template cadence detected. Mixed-metaphor risk in “chronic hush that seemed to suffocate all sound” is saved by POV’s acoustic lens, so −0.2 only. One near-simultaneity glitch: “As she walked, the trees grew twisted” implies causality rather than sequence, but clarity survives. Closure beat is clean, figurative muddle absent, keeping the 8-band intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-fire wasteland + shipwreck-ringed greenhouse + acoustic violinist is fresh, specific, non-obvious. Chronic hush as literalized atmospheric pressure defamiliarizes silence. Storytelling-as-repair motif avoids post-ap cliché by anchoring in sensory ritual (fire, bowl, music). Risk is present (lyric over plot), but coherence holds, justifying bonus. Does not reach 9-band because premise could be retold with different ruined biomes without structural fracture—freshness is tonal, not causal.</comment>
