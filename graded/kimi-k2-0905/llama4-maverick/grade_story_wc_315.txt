<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority stays concrete—fingers brushing the buckle, muscle-memory gear work—so her competence feels lived-in. The watcher’s burden is shown as tangible pressure (buckle talisman, peer trust) rather than label-speak. Her micro-choice to stay at the arbor until dawn crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Cost is visible: physical fatigue, fading stars, solitary risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the stake of “map or fail.” Closure is Charged Poise—dawn erases the patterns she’s captured, so the cost is the irretrievability of the data she now carries alone. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Buckle callback at end reweights trust burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Nocturnal arbor” and “whisper-thin wires” are handled physically—she steps, revises, balances—so the micro-setting constrains every move. Parachute buckle functions as portable setting/object that charges final image. Cloud-sea at dawn supplies tonal contrast that reweights solitude. Sensory economy favors touch & sight filtered through astronomer bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve trust by mapping unseen skies”—tightens once: dawn erases stars, forcing her to internalize the data, a non-reversible cost. No antagonist needed; environmental clock supplies pressure. Escalation is density-based: accumulating silence, cooling air, fading patterns. Agency = endurance; option foreclosed when light wins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship emerges through buckle talisman and peer trust, never sermonized. Final image of golden cloud-sea invites reflection on invisible labor. Ambiguity: will peers validate her unseen data? No moral spoon-fed. Wisdom earned via cold fingers and star-burn, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lyra’s perceptual filter—starlight “like diamonds” is astronomer’s idiom, not generic shimmer. Rhythm lengthens during revision beats, fragments at dawn, mirroring fatigue. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Free indirect clean: “her mind racing” remains in her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies from long gear-describing clauses to staccato dawn fragments. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (velvet sky, diamond stars) stay single-layer and sensory. Information dense: one line slips setting, body, and emotional charge (“the silence…reverberate through every cell”). Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cloud-mapping astronomer is fresh; parachute-buckle-as-talisman gives tactile spin to “watchers.” Accumulation structure suits subject—star patterns build, then vanish. Risk: lyric stillness could flatten tension, but payoff justifies. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
