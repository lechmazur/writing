<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The burned-spy interiority is vivid—scar tissue as perpetual reminder, pillbox as tactile conscience—but her contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted in scene. The decisive hand-clasp with her mirror-self is emotionally resonant yet causally unearned: no prior micro-choices foreshadow this reintegration, so the epiphany feels imported rather than discovered under pressure. Still, the embodied burn memory and pocketed pillbox keep her from sliding into generics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous drive lens settles into Accumulative/Textural: the silver-mist imagery keeps layering until the mirrored self offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—an Earned Stasis where the cost is the lifelong scar she keeps wearing. Orientation is clean within 120 words; transitions are single-scene. Closure lands with felt cost, yet the path to the mirror-self is coincidence-shaped (she simply “finds” the figure) rather than choice-propelled, slightly blunting the because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Mist, snow, wet-earth scent, and skeletal branches are filtered through burn-scarred perception; environment is used as micro-setting that guides her search pattern and ultimately unveils the mirror-self. The pillbox acts as portable setting-in-pocket, its engraved surface a tactile constraint each time fingers tighten. Weather never stalls plot; instead the clearing mist literally reveals the final image, fusing atmosphere to closure. One minor over-lingering on “silver hush” repeats four times, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: scanning snow for code is low-risk, and the mirror-self encounter is unforced, so no option is foreclosed. Cost is visible only in hindsight (she keeps the scars) rather than paid during the beat. A single meaningful tightening occurs when mist clears to reveal the path, yet agency remains observational rather than tactical. Escalation is poetic, not tactical; sufficient for Accumulative lens but short of 8.0 trade-off threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-reconciliation emerges through mirrored self-image rather than thesis statement; subtext resides in silent hand-clasp and pillbox weight. The “fixing what’s broken” concept stays implicit in scar tissue and spring tilt, avoiding moral tag. Final image reweights pillbox from caution-token to twin-courage emblem—an earned conceptual reprice. A half-sentence of editorial uplift (“she was ready to face whatever lay ahead”) leans toward mildEcho but is too brief to dock heavily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent psychic distance, filtering description through burn-heightened perception (damp shroud, skeletal branches). Diction stays within spy’s taciturn lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under search tension, longer cadences at mirrored embrace. One 41-word opener risks breathlessness but mirrors her scanning focus, so reads intentional. No dialogue, so voice purity is high; perceptual signature distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence layers scar memory, mist motion, or tactile detail. No paraphrase loops; “silver hush” repetition is thematic drum, not scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as shroud, branches as fingers). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One participle opener (“gazed out into the mist”) is simultaneous but physically plausible. Final line lands on image, not explanation—clean cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Mirrored-self payoff is fresh within espionage frame, yet tropes (scarred spy, secret code in snow, keepsake pillbox) remain familiar without subversion. Specific burn texture and spring-equinox tilt supply local novelty. Risk is lyrical rather than plot-subversive, earning modest bonus. Transformation test: swap scar for grief and story still works, indicating moderate universality. Feels like polished vignette rather than rule-bending invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Her scar drives perceptual bias and tactile choices; burn memory surfaces in three separate beats, shaping why she touches the pillbox and how she reads the snow. Mirror-self moment reframes courage as self-acceptance, tying closure to prior damage. Without burn, handshake loses cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Pillbox appears in pocket twice, then in final image as twin-courage talisman; engraving never described, keeping irreplaceability partially generic. Still, its weight offsets mirror-self anxiety, so removal would thin the tactile anchor. Middle development missing—never used during snow search—caps below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Concept motivates the bluff pilgrimage and supplies thematic echo in mirror-self repair. Scar = broken, spring = renewal, handshake = mend. Concept shapes stakes but does not constrain tactics; she never confronts an external break that risks further fracture, so causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Trait stated twice; enacted once when she steels herself to approach the mirror-self. Prudence visible in cautious snow scanning; daring in unarmed approach to phantom. No visible trade-off (e.g., choosing scar-touch over stealth), so cost under-lit. Sufficient for beat-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>“Vouchsafe” is prompt language, never internalized; action translated as “promise to herself,” which is generic resolve. Promise gains body via handshake but is not dramatized as guarded gift or risk. Swappable with “vow” without structural change, capping below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Method appears only at climax—she remembers snow may hide code, then notices path outline. No prior setup of cipher knowledge or failed decoding attempts, so mechanics unexplored. Path revelation feels accidental rather than earned decryption; hence ornamental utility outweighs causal shaping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Setting pressure is continuous: mist limits visibility, dictates slow scanning; clearing mist reveals path and mirror-self, fusing geography to turning point. Bluff height supplies isolation that makes self-confrontation plausible. Without mist-throttled vision, search pace and revelation logic collapse.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Spring tilt named once as metaphoric renewal but never tracked as calendar (melting snow, changing light) that alters tactics. Time remains static—scene could be any dusk. Seasonal cue seeds theme yet exerts no ticking pressure; hence moderate integration, mostly symbolic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Desire propels entire hike; internal contradiction voiced (“trepidation” vs “prudently daring”). Mirror-self embodies located courage, so payoff directly addresses motive. Friction would sharpen if external danger tested new boldness, but as introspective quest it satisfies closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Silver hush” recurs four times, modulating from menace to peaceful acceptance, charging final smile. Mist tone shifts with visibility, mirroring internal thaw. Cadence matches lyric arc; removal would gut atmospheric cohesion and final resonant hush. Tone is story’s spine.</comment>
