<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is concrete—“bare feet carried her forward” links body to resolve—and the awkward confidence surfaces once (“awkwardly confident, a trait that manifested in her deliberate strides”). Yet the arc drifts into summary: the hum merely “reignited the flame,” so we’re told, not shown, the decisive micro-choice. Interior contradiction is absent; she never doubts the pilgrimage, so pressure stays flat. The ending feels fore-ordained rather than earned at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain: abandoned bay → rumor of circle → barefoot climb → hum → reignited purpose. Orientation anchors who/where by line 4; no penalty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “the stars shone bright with possibility” reframes the bay from defeat to launchpad. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the hum solves the problem it didn’t help create, so price feels abstract, capping high-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spaceport bay’s rusted hulks, cold metal floor, and grimy windows are tactile and POV-filtered; the bay later flips from graveyard to runway in the closing beat. Mountain stone circle is rendered through vibration rather than postcard visuals. Opera glasses act as micro-setting: their “intricate patterns reflecting…her renewed spirit” charge the final image. One slip—“the air thickened with an almost palpable energy” drifts toward vague intensifier, not sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Dominant stake: rekindle rebellion fire. Tightening occurs at the circle when hum forces a stance crystallization: “resolve strengthened.” But agency is reactive—she receives the hum rather than bargaining, risking, or forfeiting anything visible. No concrete price is dramatized; consequence is emotional assertion. Escalation is thus single-stage and抒情 rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: derelict tech vs. primordial stones, stars vs. rust, culminating in the idea that stillness can recharge action. No moralizing summary; final image of refracted starlight reweights earlier debris. Subtext resides in the opera glasses—ornate fragility against industrial decay—though the hum’s mythic shorthand flirts with abstraction. Ambiguity lingers: will renewed fire lead to victory or another cycle? Complexity acknowledged without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature favors skyward, cosmic diction—“celestial map,” “stars twinkled into sharper focus”—consistent with stargazer POV. Rhythm swells deliberately; cadence mirrors hum crescendo. No dialogue, hence no voice collision. Occasional elevated register (“testament to the transience of power”) fits mythic tone and is foreshadowed early, so reads intentional rather than drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths modulate from short declaratives to longer accumulative strings. Figurative language is dense—four metaphors in three lines at peak hum—but pattern is taught early (“stars twinkled into sharper focus”) and paid off, so allowed. Scaffolding minimal; only mild paraphrase (“the silence that followed was not stillness, but a held breath”). Some stacked modifiers (“thunderous serenity”) risk purple, but metaphor stays coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Combines post-rebellion spaceport with neolithic stone circle—fresh juxtaposition that externalizes tech/primitive duality. Barefoot pilgrimage and opera glasses add idiosyncratic texture. Mythic hum-as-catalyst is familiar, but its pairing with astro-archaeological setting feels specific to this piece. Risk is moderate; not conceptually revolutionary but avoids trope checklist. Transformation test succeeds: swap setting/objects and the emotional geometry collapses.</comment>
