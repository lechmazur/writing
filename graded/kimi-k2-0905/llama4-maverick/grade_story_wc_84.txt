<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s perpetual surprise is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; she scans, deduces, inserts, and feels generic “excitement” without visible flaw or cost. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“sense of belonging”) rather than particular perception. The closure beat offers Charged Poise but the emotional reconfiguration is asserted, not dramatized through a prior mistake or visible price. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; solo arc remains competent but safe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is linear but intact: chip-signal → star-map → chip found → console lights up. Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing—Lena re-weights “belonging” from missing artifact to cosmic connection—yet the cost is only asserted (“journey far from over”) not felt on-page. Orientation is clear by 50 words; no meaningful tightening or constraint narrows her options inside the scene; escalation is flat. The lens holds as straightforward Causal, but the ending image lacks a tangible forfeiture or fresh limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ancient observatory at dusk is vividly sketched through sound, dust scent, and star-map carvings that guide action; spatial anchoring is clean. Micro-setting works: the wall star trails directly constrain her search path and charge the final lens flare. Environment never threatens or resource-limits her; it decorates more than it pressures. Still, the specificity of place is story-specific and integrated into goal-directed movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes—decode the frequency—are declared early but never tested or narrowed; no alternative path is foreclosed, no tangible loss risked. Agency is purely procedural: follow signal, follow carvings, insert chip; coincidence simply delivers the chip where map points. One meaningful escalation is required; here pressure is static wonder rather than rising cost. Closure re-weights meaning but does not emerge from a prior dilemma or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges implicitly from star maps and antique stones, avoiding explicit sermon. The final Conceptual Repricing links cosmic cartography to personal rootedness, offering quiet resonance. No counter-readings or tensions complicate the insight; the epiphany feels singular rather than wrested from conflict. Texture is pleasingly non-generic, though the insight is gentle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable, perceptually filtered through Lena’s drone-tech gaze: “sensors picked up,” “data to refine.” Syntax is calm, slightly cadenced, matching the meditative trek; no head-hop or register drift. Diction remains within a technician’s lexicon; no strained poetic reach. Voice is competent, not idiosyncratic—could belong to any competent observer—hence stops short of memorability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and advance steadily. Occasional soft fillers—“sense of anticipation,” “soft whisper of the wind”—but no mixed metaphors or register clashes. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. Final paragraph repeats “brilliant dimness” without fresh inflection, a minor cadence stall that keeps the score from 7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Drone-plus-ancient-observatory is a fresh mash-up; star-carvings-as-GPS gives the quest a specific hook. Emotional payload—belonging equals cosmic pattern—is quiet rather than risky. No rule twist or character contradiction startles; the arc is predictable once the map is read. Competent synthesis, not bold reinvention.</comment>
