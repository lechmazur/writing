<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid (“haunting sense of absence”) and her obsession is embodied in repeated night-time archive dives. The final realization—that files were merely archived, not erased—gives her a credible micro-renunciation, but the cost feels abstract rather than lived; no tool, relationship, or body-limit is forfeited, so the change lands as intellectual, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the 4-1-5-9 pattern intensifies like a digital dripping tap, re-weighting the stake each time it surfaces. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—“the files were not deleted, they were simply archived”—a quiet reversal that reconfigures Lena’s void into custodial wonder; the cost is the irrevocable awareness that memory is never truly lost, only hidden, and she must keep tending it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The server-labyrinth is sketched with chilling economy (“whispers of the past linger in every forgotten password”) and the recurring numbers act as micro-setting, constraining Lena’s attention like trip-wires. The final image of the dark archive shutting down carries the earned chill of a grave being closed, giving the space a totemic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the truth behind “Stellar” disappearances—tightens via pattern accretion rather than causal reversals; each new 4-1-5-9 sighting narrows Lena’s mental options until the revelation that the files were merely hidden re-prices her obsession into custodial duty. No tangible price is dramatized on-page, so escalation is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: digital absence is not erasure but burial, and memory-keeping is an endless exhumation. The closing reversal reweights the motif of “sensed absence” into a call to perpetual stewardship, avoiding moralizing. One abstract line (“she was searching for a way to fill the void left by her own lost loved ones”) edges toward Echo territory but is saved by its placement mid-text, not at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Third-person tight POV stays inside Lena’s perceptual filter; syntax grows clipped under pressure (“whispers of the past linger…”) and widens into oracular cadence at the end. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but the narrative idiom is consistent and slightly hypnotic, suiting an archival trance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured, with purposeful repetition of “echo,” “void,” and “numbers” creating incantatory momentum. No loops or scaffold detected; figurative layers (“digital detritus,” “ghostly signature”) remain coherent and do not stall the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “corporate archivist vs. missing coders” angle freshens the found-artifact trope; the 4-1-5-9 steganography feels native to digital archives rather than a pasted puzzle. The quiet reversal that nothing was truly deleted is elegantly non-obvious, though the emotional stakes stay safely interior rather than risky.</comment>
