<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The conjurer’s “deep-seated desire to understand the mathematics of emotion” is declared, not dramatized; interiority stays abstract (“felt a spark of understanding”) and the glass eyes do more emotional work than she does. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-ritual, so the final “enigmatic smile” feels unearned. Micro-choices are limited to finger-weaving and kneeling—gestural poverty that keeps pressure external. Still, the solitary POV is coherent and the character’s flaw (intellectualizing grief) is legible, holding the piece above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s “quiet promise” reweights the earlier “ambiguous loss” with a buried optimism whose cost is the conjurer’s solitary secrecy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of stillness → ritual → hush → dawn cadence tightens the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props. The eyes’ provenance is told in one reflective block ≤20 % and anchors a present micro-choice (scrying), satisfying BRR. Minor loop: “gentle rustle… gentle swaying… gently inventive” drags but does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is immediate and sensory-dense; luminescent fungi, mosaic stone, and dripping stalactites filter through the conjurer’s selective attention. The chipped patterns on the stepping stone constrain the ritual mechanics and return in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One slip: “trees… etched against the moonlit ceiling” momentarily flattens the 3-D cave, but the error is peripheral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quantify the unquantifiable” loss—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via textural deepening: orchard hush → ritual intensity → spark of insight, but no visible price is paid (no energy drain, tool crack, or irreversible forfeiture). The climax is cognitive, not tactical, so options never visibly narrow; ambiguity remains intact but static. Sufficient for mid-band, yet the lack of a felt cost keeps it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief’s resistance to algorithmic mastery. Subtext lives in the glass eyes—artificial gaze versus living emotion—returning as silent guardians to reweight the premise. No moralizing; final smile is imagistic, not thesis. The concept stays intellectually cool, limiting emotional aftereffect, but the resonance is coherent and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—“gentle,” “soft,” “quiet” repetitions mirror the conjurer’s hushed inventiveness. Syntax modulates with ritual tempo: longer hypnotic clauses build to the short spark of understanding. No dialogue, so no contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“dovetail the disparate threads”) stays within a scholar-magician lexicon and is pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: concrete nouns (“mosaic stepping stone,” “dripping stalactites”) outweigh modifiers. Rhythm breathes with scene—cavern hush invites longer sentences. Minor loop penalty: “gentle” trio and two “seemed to” filters dull immediacy (−0.3). No mixed metaphors or scaffold; final line lands clean. Within high-band tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of taxidermy eyes + emotional mathematics + subterranean orchard feels idiosyncratic and non-template. The eyes’ reprise as eternal watchers crystallizes the concept without exposition. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric meditation rather than plot twist—but the synthesis is memorable. Could swap cavern for another liminal space with minor edits, capping ascent.</comment>
