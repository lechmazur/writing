<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scavenger’s contradictory impulses—collecting fragments vs. surrendering to stillness—are alive in the final shutter-click, but the camera wheel rather than the body drives the decisive beat; interiority is vivid yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied, keeping the renunciation just shy of visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: fragment-gathering intensifies texture until the single click reweights the premise; orientation is taught early through mirrored sky/water and the halted carousel; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing— the exposed frame makes irretrievability felt—though the beat could be sharper if the wheel’s earlier clicks had tightened choice rather than echoed mood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lagoon-mirror and carousel-shadow function as micro-setting that steers attention and ultimately frames the photograph; sensory economy is strong, but the environment never physically constrains movement or alters tactic— it is atmospheric, not instrumental, preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stake—recovering personal narrative from eroded ambition—tightens through each whispered fragment; the final click forcibly ends the search, a visible forfeiture of further scavenging; cost is present but understated, legible more as poetic stillness than as acute loss, capping escalation short of piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of irretrievability vs. preservation emerges through the scavenger’s act, never sermonized; the exposed photo offers a resonant non-literal answer; ambiguity lingers without confusion, though the regret mist approaches thematic overtone in final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Lyric third-person sustains a consistent perceptual signature—fractured, mirroring, echoing; patterned elision (“kinetic lagoon above the clouds”) is taught early and paid off in the stillness of the final image; no head-hopping; rhythm modulates with the wheel’s staccato, propelling rather than obstructing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, high density, minimal scaffold; figurative language is selective (“fractured stillness,” “palette of blues and whites”) and coherent; occasional echo of “stillness” and “fragment” keeps it from flawless propulsion but never loops into artifact; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>The cloud-top lagoon and halted carousel reframe familiar regret through a surreal but internally consistent lens; the disposable camera as closure engine refreshes the trope of memory-hunting; risk is present but gentle—conceptual rather than subversive—keeping the story just outside memorable singularity.</comment>
