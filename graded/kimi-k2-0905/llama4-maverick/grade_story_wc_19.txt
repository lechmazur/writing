<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli’s claustrophobia is embodied through the floating ritual; the porcelain doll acts as a tactile proxy for internal state, and the moment of release encodes a micro-choice with cost. Father remains a functional prop; no status crucible, but the single-POV interiority stays coherent and specific. The final stance—“claustrophobia had not vanished”—is an earned stasis that forecloses the old panic without miracle cure, satisfying the 9- gate for credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of silence-tasting builds density until the gilded hush reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise: the hovering doll crystallizes options and carries visible cost (the child’s contracted world “stretches”). No orientation debt; spatial anchors (trellis lattice, cloud level) arrive by line 4. Father’s motivation (desensitization by sensory deprivation) is causal glue that holds the ellipse of inversion-hour.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The trellis is not backdrop but instrument: latticework becomes a horizontal womb during inversion, constraining movement and forcing aerial orientation that literalizes Eli’s fear. Cloud-height cold, golden light, and floating soil chunks are filtered through Eli’s selective attention to silence-flavors. The porcelain doll micro-setting meets the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalogue, only dusk-light, creaking vines, and the hush that “thickens”—all guiding the release of the doll.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Eli harvest enough silence-flavor to dilute claustrophobia before gravity re-normalizes? Stakes tighten when the doll is let go—an irreversible micro-wager that the hush will return it. Cost is the risk of permanent panic if the experiment fails; the floating stillness makes that risk legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent, and the hourglass of inversion supplies the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the palate of silences rather than assertion: fear contracts, attention expands. The gilded hush reframes silence from absence to nourishment, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image—doll resting on palm—offers a non-literal answer: stillness can be portable. No thematic echo in closing paragraph; the insight stays implicit, carried by object.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a child’s perceptual signature: synesthetic tasting of silence, synaptic snow-flake detail. Syntax shortens under inversion—“It hovered”—then lengthens as gravity returns, mirroring physiological shift. Porcelain doll recurs with shifting emotional valence, rhythmically paced. No dialogue, so voice purity is un-contaminated; filter verbs avoided, diction stays within a precocious child’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; no stacked figurative language in the float beat. Information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world-rule data—“objects… started to float, and a soft, golden light seeped into the air.” Sentence rhythm varies from staccato single clauses to longer carnivalesque catalog of silence-flavors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves on image that recharges doll and hush. No template cadence; each sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses inversion-hour with silence-gustation—fresh synthesis, not trope recycling. Risk: lyrical sci-fi in 700 words could collapse into gimmick, but causality stays intact. Specificity of silence-flavors (snow on lake, desert starlight) keeps concept grounded. Transformation test fails if Eli is renamed, because silence-tasting is inseparable from claustrophobia cure; hence originality is locked to character.</comment>
