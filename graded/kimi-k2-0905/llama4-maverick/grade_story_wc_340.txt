<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “warmly inquisitive eyes” and habit of reading ice-crystal light keep her perceptual signature alive—but she never makes a micro-choice that costs her anything; the diary simply yields its secrets, so no path is foreclosed. The emotional arc is all reception, no gamble. The goggles and folded page are handled, yet remain emotionally inert; they never constrain or charge her final stance, so the “earned stasis” feels observed, not paid for.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ascent and diary pages accrue density until the shrine chamber crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara folds the page, the goggles glow—reconfiguring the spire from prison to sanctuary with felt conceptual cost. The lens holds; no orientation debt. Light-diary decryption is taught early and repaid in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Icebound spire, elevator frost, and scattered-light tool are viscerally selective: frost patterns and etched walls guide Elara’s decryption method and charge the final shrine glow. Spatial choreography is clean—ten-floor ascent, corridor walk, door push—without white-room drift. The goggles function as micro-setting; their gleam reweights meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—remains abstract; tension tightens only texturally as diary pages unfold, but no live option is foreclosed. Agency is purely receptive; the diary yields without resistance, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is a single cadence shift from mystery to shrine reveal; sufficient for short accumulative arc but barely crests 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: love distilled in ice, beauty inseparable from loss. Subtext lives in the shrine’s “soft, ethereal light” and the goggles’ glow—objects re-weighted, not explained. No moralizing; the final fold of the page lets ambiguity linger. The concept avoids thematic echo; “joy beneath anguish” is dramatized through discovered relics, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“sunlight danced through ice crystals” feels hers, not touristic. Syntax breathes with ascent cadence; no head-hopping. Dialogue absent, so no register clash. Diction remains within servant-class plausibility; “affectionate detachment” is shown via calm bodily micro-movements rather than told.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; no template cadence or synonym loops. Scaffolding minimal—only “the elevator’s gentle hum and the soft hiss” feels slightly double-stated. Metaphors (“whisper secrets”, “map that led her”) are sparse and coherent. Final line lands clean; no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports contemplative escalation without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Icebound-love premise is fresh, yet diary-as-rosary trope familiar; transformation comes via light-cipher method tied to ice physics, giving local specificity. Goggles-as-keeper-token repurposed into emotional lens is the sharpest inflection. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—so no bonus. Synthesis feels inevitable but not startling; still, particulars override generic template.</comment>
