<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Janitor’s interiority drifts into abstract “cosmic” rhapsody; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The single micro-choice—moving the lantern glass—lacks visible cost and changes nothing. Spiritual curiosity is asserted, never tested; vulnerability remains a slogan. The ending renunciation is foreshadowed but not dramatized with stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure reaches for Charged Poise via the lantern-glass talisman, but the cost is only asserted (“strength lies in vulnerability”). Accumulative lens holds, yet the final paragraph re-states theme rather than reweighting options. No causal tightening occurs; the night simply ends. Orientation is clear, but the story never risks a real reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Station is sketched with selective sensory detail—hum of computers, soft-bristled broom—filtered through janitor’s quiet attention. Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting and final image, but it never constrains a choice; it merely glows. Spatial choreography is stable; no world-rule errors. Atmosphere supports stillness motif without overstaying.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No escalation: pressure is ambient, not rising. Stakes are declared—“find strength in vulnerability”—yet never tested by an on-page dilemma or trade-off. The janitor’s sweeping continues unchanged; the stars impose no cost. Coincidence-level calm prevails; no option is foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges through imagery rather than lecture, but it remains static. Subtext is thin because no conflicting value is dramatized; insight is paraphrased in closing lines. Lantern glass acquires symbolic glow yet changes no meaning. Emotional after-effect is gentle appreciation, not reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient floats above the janitor rather than inhabiting his perceptual quirks; diction stays consistent but lacks idiosyncratic texture. Rhythm is lullaby-monotonous, suiting stillness yet flattening tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “felt”) soften immediacy yet remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, occasionally lyrical, but leans on abstract nouns (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) that recycle the same stem. Sentence variety is moderate; paragraph breaks track meditation beats. No mixed metaphors or grammatical slips. Information density dips in repetitive thematic summaries near the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor trope is familiar; the piece’s angle—spiritual empathy through star-sweeping—adds modest freshness. Stillness-as-strength concept is not radically reframed. Yellow lantern glass feels like late-attached symbol rather than originating necessity. Risk level is safe; no structural or tonal gambit that deepens stakes.</comment>
