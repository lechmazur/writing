<comment>Brazen calm is shown repeatedly in composed action under mortality; the diary and copper acts are concrete micro-choices. Interiority, however, stays in serene summary ("they knew," "they believed") rather than dramatized contradiction, so we watch calm rather than feel its cost. No second character appears, so status/relationship tests are waived. Final renunciation is earned but under-articulated in body or voice.

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard’s slow sonic bloom is the tightening. Closure—earned stasis as caretaker accepts death while wire song continues—lands with conceptual cost ("subtle reminder") and is prepared by iterative copper/diary beats. Orientation clear by 40 words; no set-up breaks. Lacks one visceral beat where calm cracks; that caps emotional punch at 8.0 boundary.

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Copper-wrapped oaks and living stone pillars are tactile, specific, and used (wrapping, resonance). Sensory hierarchy biased to caretaker’s botanist eye: scent, hum, patina. Setting supplies the means of transformation and charges the final image; without it, the resonant closure collapses. Minor deficit: no weather or spatial choreography under conflict moment.

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create interspecies harmony before death—is declared early but never tested by opposition; no risk, obstacle, or resource loss appears. Pressure is ambient ("time declined") rather than acute; no beat where calm frays or plan nearly fails. Escalation is accretive imagery, not option-narrowing. Closure offers acceptance, not confrontation, so cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—reciprocity with nature—emerges through iterative orchard transformation rather than lecture. Copper wire as engineering of empathy is a fresh metaphor that reweights the ancient temple premise. Final image of wire singing after death avoids moralizing; resonance is understated but present. Loses top band because no counter-argument or failure complicates the utopia.

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single, stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is scientist-lyric ("botanical diary," "natural harmonics"). Brazen calm dictates measured cadence and Latinate diction that mostly stays in character. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs ("they watched," "they knew") slightly dilute immediacy but fit reflective stance.

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, sentence lengths varied; no template cadence or loops. Figurative language is restrained, occasionally rising to quiet lyric ("trees... tuned to a new frequency"). Information density good—each paragraph advances orchard state or caretaker record. Minor overwriting: stacked abstract nouns ("interspecies respect," "harmonizing the natural and built") without sensory payoff; not severe enough to cloud closure.

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Copper-wiring oaks to mediate cross-species dialogue is a genuinely fresh synthesis of eco-SF and sound art. Temple secrets remain thematic scenery; could swap in any ancient site. Mortal urgency + sonic orchard is the memorable core, but premise not fully differentiated from "dying sage gives nature gift" template. Calm tone throughout is risk that pays off; no gimmick.
