<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward generic metaphysical labels (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her only micro-choice—keep unpicking—never tightens or risks anything tangible; the same beat repeats until spirits vanish without testing her stance. The earned cost is diffuse silence, not a foreclosed path. Voice stays consistent, yet character remains a mood-vehicle more than a knot of conflicting motives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final stillness visibly reframes the sanctuary and her mission. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silence and color mounts until the cadence shifts—and holds cleanly. Orientation is clear within 50 words; no causal fractures. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, so the beat feels slightly weightless, but the effect lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary is micro-setting that supplies shifting starlight spectra; these colors literally color her hands and the needle, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies and orbits track. The net functions as secondary micro-setting whose knots constrain every motion. Sensory selection favors sight, but it’s purposeful and mirrored in internal state. Enough specificity to pass the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the spirits—announced early. Escalation is iterative, not a tightening turn: each knot equals one whisper, no rising jeopardy or trade-off. Because the lens is Accumulative, pattern break could suffice, yet the pattern simply completes; no option is foreclosed or price paid by her. Agency is steady but static; the task accomplishes itself.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through motif of silence-as-substance; final image reweights hush from oppressive to redemptive without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—needle, light, breath—but stays singular-note. No epiphany is declared; resonance is atmospheric rather than conceptual. Complexity is muted because her interior generates no counter-argument to the mission.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that mirrors content; no head-hop. Syntax leans on anaphora (“With every knot…”) that becomes purposeful pattern once taught. Lexicon stays within poetic register; no register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—she always notices thread, light, silence—achieving texture without clutter.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid and sentence openings vary; however, near-loop phrases (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”) recur across adjacent sentences, creating scaffold churn (−0.3). Information density is moderate—some sentences do only atmospheric work. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked in clusters. No artifact touches the final line, so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Portraits of ghost-restorer via textile necromancy feel fresh; concept of silence-as-material is inventive. Yet the emotional engine—compassionate ritual without risk—resembles other quiet-magic vignettes. Risk is stylistic, not moral, so boldness is modest. Specificity of prism light and net fibres helps, but the core could transplant to another quiet-ritual scene unchanged.</comment>
