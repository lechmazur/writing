<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s curiosity and competence are sketched efficiently, but her interiority stays surface-level; the broken-arrow keepsake is the only concrete reveal of deeper self. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—she simply observes, flies, and deduces. The final awe feels told (“sense of wonder and awe”) rather than embodied through tremor, breath, or risk. Micro-choices are present but low-cost; the mission succeeds without her paying a visible price or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the glowing pool re-prices the orchard’s resilience as a planetary “gathering of echoes,” giving Lyra—and the reader—a new conceptual frame with implicit cost (she can never possess the energy, only witness it). Causal chain is thin—discovery happens by following accelerated growth rather than by a hard choice—but the accumulative pattern holds. Orientation in first 120 w is firm: pilot, orchard planet, countdown. No lens contradiction; the shift from tech mission to mystical insight is telegraphed by the arrow tip’s unexplained vibration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, gravity-inversion physics, and the iridescent pool create a tactile, non-generic alien orchard. Sensory selection stays filtered through pilot priorities—gravity pull, chlorophyll glow, water-flow cues—so description never becomes catalog. The broken arrow and the pool act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible ship moves or geography slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the source of resilience—is declared early and answered, but pressure is observational rather than hazardous; no live risk or narrowing option tests Lyra’s commitment. The hour-long inversion clock is mentioned but doesn’t tighten tactics—she lands before time expires. Cost is conceptual, not felt: she leaves “reluctantly,” but nothing is forfeited or foreclosed. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of wonder, not a crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: survival through symbiosis with planetary mystery rather than domination. The arrow tip—human weapon worn harmless—mirrors the orchard’s transformation of violence into fertile energy, a nice subtextual echo. No explicit moral statement; final image of the ship “dancing on solar winds” lets resonance breathe. Slight abstraction in “whirling silence” phrase keeps it from full punch, but complexity is respected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lyra with consistent pilot jargon and perceptual filter—“stomach drop,” “ethereal fingers,” “water flow method.” Syntax is steady, rhythmic, with occasional lyrical lift that suits the planetary wonder. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction remains within her occupational lexicon. Final cadence earns a quiet poetic lift without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lean scaffolding; most sentences advance setting, character, or concept simultaneously. A few soft stems—“she felt,” “she noticed”—but they appear outside peak beats and don’t clog momentum. Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles) and serve imagery rather than self-display. Opening and closing lines carry satisfying sonic bookends without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combining gravity-flip orchard, sonic-echo life-force, and a worn weapon relic feels fresh; tropes are remixed, not photocopied. Specificity of “water flow navigation under inverted gravity” is a vivid, non-obvious pilot workaround. The core insight—resilience as planetary chorus rather than tech solution—avoids eco-cliché by keeping the phenomenon inexplicable. Risk level is moderate; could push further into consequences of harvesting or defying the echoes.</comment>
