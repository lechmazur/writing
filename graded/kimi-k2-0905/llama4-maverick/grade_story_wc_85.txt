<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is moody but abstract (“guilt-ridden” named, not embodied); no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The memory-flash from driftwood is the only micro-choice, yet it changes nothing on-page—she still returns to client unchanged. Watch-hand cue has potential but never tests her flaw. Earned cost is missing; closure is a restatement of intent, not a paid price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated “sieved hush” and sea imagery thicken mood until final stoic resolve. However, no decisive change or felt cost lands—she simply decides to “continue,” so closure is declaration, not reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by 50 words; spatial track clean. Lack of causal tightening keeps pressure flat; driftwood memory is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt terrace, dusk light, salt-rot air, and driftwood carvings are vividly filtered through her gloom. Sensory triangulation supports theme of eroded truths. Setting never constrains her physically, but the final lunar glow re-weights the terrace as moral courtroom, achieving Charged Poise. Strong specificity almost compensates for static interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she confront the withheld truth?”—is declared early yet never tightened. No active opposition or trade-off appears; driftwood vision complicates nothing. Escalation is accretive imagery, not rising cost. Closure lacks visible price; options unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-vs-manufactured memory emerges through “sieved hush” and false-heritage vocation. Subtextual tension is present but static: the driftwood vision could have forced a moral recalibration yet doesn’t. Final image of glinting watch hand offers quiet irony yet no new weight. Ambiguity lingers, but insight feels suspended, not earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice sustains wistful, elegiac cadence; diction (“mournful sigh,” “lunar glow”) matches dusk melancholy. No head-hop; perceptual signature stable. Repetition of “sieved hush” acts as incantatory pattern, taught early and paid off in final line. Filter verbs minimal; syntax breathes with scene rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraphs echo wave-like ebb. Some adjective stacking (“serene gloom,” “melancholy haven”) edges purple but stays within atmospheric license. No scaffold loops or paraphrase clutter. Occasional abstraction weighs beats (“weight of unspoken words”) without concrete tether. Closure image clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<comment>Black-market genealogist who forges false memories is fresh; pairing with “sieved hush” and driftwood augury deepens concept. Execution leans on mood more than plot innovation; memory-flash from wood hints at magic but remains undeveloped. Risk is moderate, coherence high. Feels memorable yet could push mechanics further.</comment>
