<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern lighter’s curiosity about deleted memories is declared early but never tested under pressure; the only micro-choice—touching the crystal—feels externally compelled, not driven by an interior contradiction we have watched build. Embodied emotion is limited to “sense of trepidation,” a label that flattens the pivotal beat. The pressed flowers reappear at the end, but their link to recovered memories is asserted, not dramatized through action or sensory flash; thus the arc is more associative than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds atmospheric density until the crystal delivers a conceptual repricing. Closure lands—a blue-lit crystalline refraction of memory—but the cost is conceptual, not dramatized on the body or future choice, so the “felt” test is barely met. Orientation is clear within 120 words, yet the whale’s causal role remains symbolic rather than operative, slightly blurring the tightening logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dock-side harbor, salt-crystal tunnels, and subterranean chamber are sketched with economical, luminescent particulars that refract through the POV’s lantern-trained eye. The crystalline walls act as both setting and micro-setting tool, constraining motion and supplying the final image; this satisfies the 9+ gate even though broader city geography is impressionistic. Sensory hierarchy favors light and salt over sound, mirroring the “gleaming silence” motif without mechanical cycling through all senses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and deepened through spatial descent, but escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing; no tactics are altered by the gravity pockets en route. The crystal contact delivers a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise, yet the protagonist’s agency is observational, not decision-based, so the tightening is textural, not causal. Cost is implied via recovered memory flood, but no visible price is paid on the page, capping entry into high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as physical sediment that can be re-mined, gravity as emotional weight. The wildflowers and crystal echo without overt symbolic declaration, achieving resonance through imagistic return rather than thesis statement. Subtelty avoids moralizing, but the whale remains an under-exploited thematic provocateur, slightly muting the conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers at a lyric distance, sustaining a hushed, salt-lit cadence that matches “gleaming silence.” Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature leans on refracted lantern-light and gravity tugs, keeping diction within the lighter’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue appears, averting voice-collapse risk; rhythmic repetition of “gleaming silence” reads as intentional motif rather than template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scrambles of identical stems. Information density is high—each clause advances setting or interior pull. One paraphrase loop: “the soft glow…soft, blue light” reiterates luminescence without new pressure, but it does not touch the closure beat. Metaphors stay consistent within optic/gravity field; no mixed vehicles or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fusing gravity anomalies with coffee-ground divination inside a salt-crystal lab is a fresh, non-obvious mash-up, transformed through the lantern lighter’s occupational lens. The whale feels like borrowed spectacle that never functionally intersects the memory hunt, slightly diluting originality. Conceptual risk is moderate; execution stays coherent, but the narrative does not push its own premise into uncomfortable terrain.</comment>
