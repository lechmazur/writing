<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction. “She felt a surge of curiosity” is diagnostic label-speak. The ledger-triggered shift to “guardian / seeker” is declared, not dramatized; cost is soft. Steadily adaptive is only asserted, never tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, ledger, and scorched testament layer into a Charged Poise closure. Anchor clear by word 30. No decisive change on-page; final stance is epiphanic narration rather than visible renunciation. Closure cost is atmospheric, not concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canyon and frost patterns are recurrent, charged micro-settings that constrain her reading of the ledger; final image crystallizes around frost etchings. Sensory economy favors texture over exposition. Spatial grounding stays consistent; starlight → dawn progression is clean. Meets 9+ gate: frost pattern reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find purpose in the pauses”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tightening narrows options. Pressure is ambient, not actionable; ledger decoding has no visible obstacle or price. Escalation is a soft accretion of images rather than a beat that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of “finding truth in stillness” emerges via frost/ledger parallel rather than statement. Final paragraph drifts toward explicit sermon (“she knew she would carry this sense of purpose”), lightly over-articulating. Resonance is present but capped by absence of tangible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to her perceptual filter; diction stays glass-artist precise (“luminous,” “etched,” “refracted”). Rhythm modulates with long breath-like sentences that mirror canyon stillness; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off at dawn image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich cadence risks purple overload (“inky shadows,” “drifting resonance”) yet sustains coherent texture. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary openings. One paraphrase loop: “she felt a sense of…” x3. Closure image stays clear. Slight register lift in final paragraph keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fusion of glass artistry with smuggler-ledger cryptography is fresh; frost-as-code is a pleasing lateral leap. Concept leans on familiar “ancestral secret in wild landscape” template without subverting it. Emotional specificity is present but muted by abstract closure. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure, coherence holds.</comment>
