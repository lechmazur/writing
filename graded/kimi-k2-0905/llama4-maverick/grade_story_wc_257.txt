<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The jeweller’s grief-to-recovery arc is legible, but interiority stays abstract (“turmoil within,” “subdued ardor”) and never crystallises into a contradictory, body-level choice. The single visible micro-choice—placing origami—lacks visible cost or risk; success feels preordained rather than wrested. Emotional states are named, not embodied; no moment shows the body betraying or overriding intent. The arc satisfies the closure gate (resonant reconfiguration via the blooming brooch) but remains emotionally generalised.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (curtains, origami stellar tuning) and lands a resonant reconfiguration when the brooch captures starlight. Causality is soft—origami merely “subtly alter” celestial bodies without tangible feedback or failure path—so pressure feels atmospheric rather than consequential. Closure is present and charged (textual image of the stencil shimmering) but cost is conceptual, not felt on the body or scene. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Timeless observatory functions as micro-setting that supplies both tool (starlight) and metaphoric mirror; spatial choreography is clean (bench, curtains, domed glass). Sensory economy favours scent and sight, filtered through artisanal priorities. The curtains’ liquid ripple is a concrete, physics-bending detail that charges the final image. Setting never stalls momentum; it actively guides the illumination tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive creative joy—is signalled early; escalation is textural (curtains brighten, mood lifts) rather than option-narrowing. No tangible price or risk is dramatized; success feels inevitable. The single “tightening” is the curtains reaching peak glow, but it complicates nothing—merely confirms success. Meets 600-800 word threshold for one meaningful intensification, but lacks visible cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into craft emerges through the blooming flower stencil and star-capturing brooch rather than explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the shift from “withered heart” to “delicate filigree,” a visual re-pricing. Final image resists moralising, offering quiet resonance. Ambiguity is present but controlled; insight is earned via concrete artefacts, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, artisanal perceptual signature—attention to silver threads, sandalwood, vellum—with rhythmic control and no head-hopping. Diction stays within plausible craft-centric lexicon; syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, shortens during origami placement. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Texture feels deliberate rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with prepositional phrases, participles, and concrete nouns without falling into template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial rhythms,” “otherworldly light”) risks register drift but stays consistent with observatory grandeur. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information density is high. Minor scaffolding in repeated “as they worked” stems, but never within closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical origami as craft-talisman mechanic merges horology, mourning jewellery, and textile illusion. Stakes are intimate rather than world-scale, avoiding trope inflation. Conceptual integrity holds—curtains’ artificial yet star-responsive nature is taught early and paid off in the brooch. Risk is moderate; the piece trusts quiet lyric accretion over plot pyrotechnics, achieving memorable specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
