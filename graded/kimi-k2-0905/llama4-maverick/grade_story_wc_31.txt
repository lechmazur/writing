<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity is named but never tested; he drifts rather than chooses. No contradictory impulse or felt cost when he “signifies” by wandering. The interiority is atmospheric, not revelatory—he never doubts, fears, or sacrifices. Closure is an epiphany without prior contradiction, so the change feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation lands early and the causal path is simple: curiosity → find book → look out window → see truth. Wandering-as-signification is the only beat that meaningfully advances knowledge, and it’s under-motivated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“he would never see the world the same”), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Lens holds as an Accumulative/Textural drift, yet the tightening is single-thread and thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Salt-air, rotting hull, lantern reflections—details are selective and POV-filtered. The sunken-library locale works as an atmospheric engine, but it never constrains action (no drowning risk, no spatial trap). Lantern sea at the end recharges the visual motif; micro-setting (book, key tag) handled in motion. Lacks a 9+ gate because no object or setting feature alters tactics or exacts price.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stake is “understand color of sound” — abstract, low-urgency. Pressure is atmospheric (dark, silence), not causal; no reversal or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of wonder, not a trade-off. Luck (happening to glimpse lanterns) cues the final insight;agency is passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of perception’s limits emerges through recurrent light/sound imagery. No explicit moral, final image reframes prior motifs. Subtext stays shallow—no silence-as-betrayal or knowledge-as-burden. Ambiguity is present but not charged; insight is delivered more than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight; perceptual signature is consistent—“flickering light,” “meteor hush,” “threads of sound and light.” Rhythm swells with cadenced clauses that mirror Kael’s trance; no head-hopping. Diction edges toward the poetic but remains in character. Dialogue absent, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; metaphor strings are patterned, not cluttered. No synonym loops or paraphrase beats. Occasional elevated register (“luminous vows,” “celestial map”) borders on decoration but stays coherent. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Combining sunken library, sky lanterns, and synesthetic “color of sound” yields fresh texture. Premise is high-concept but execution leans on atmosphere over causal twist. Wandering-as-signification is a mild inversion of quest structure. Specificity of pier-lamplighter occupation is under-used; could swap jobs with minimal change.</comment>
