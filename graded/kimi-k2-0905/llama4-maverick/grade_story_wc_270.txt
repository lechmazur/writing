<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Akira’s insurgent-granny grit is vivid in gesture and sensory filter, but interiority slips into label-speak (“implanted destiny unfolding within her”) that over-explains the epiphany. The telepathy quirk is shown—plants whisper and sway—yet the beat where it decodes the kite fails to reveal a contradictory impulse or cost, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied wariness and the trembling retrieval of the orb earn a credible endurance that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal spine holds: kite → decode → orb → destiny accepted, each step triggered by on-page agency. Closure lands as Charged Poise—golden light bathing Akira while plants chorus—reconfiguring her insurgent role into evolutionary steward; the cost is the irreversible fusion with destiny she can no longer refuse. One scaffold loop (“As she…”) repeats three times mid-arc, dulling propulsion, but no beat is skipped or soft-resolved. Orientation is anchored by sulfur and damp earth within 60 words; no debt.</comment>

<comment>Volcanic springs act as micro-setting: steam keeps visibility low, sulfur stings nostrils, hot water forces her to probe gingerly for the glowing orb. The kite tail’s fabric, once decoded, becomes a tool that literally rewrites her tactical path. Sensory selection stays inside POV—she notices quivering leaves, not tourist vistas—and the final image of the orb’s warm light refracts back to the earth-core heat, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claim the embryo to evolve tradition—signals early and tightens when the plants’ fevered pitch warns of surveillance or competition; retrieval is not guaranteed. One meaningful reversal: decoding flips the kite from trash to key, narrowing options to “open orb now.” Cost is legible—once unsealed, the destiny cannot be returned, only borne—though the price is more conceptual than visceral. Escalation stays causal under the insurgent lens; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges through the embryo’s golden pulse and Akira’s refusal to stay merely insurgent; no character states “this is evolution.” The plant telepathy motif returns in the closing chorus, reweighting the whispers from eerie background to triumphant approval. Final image avoids moralizing; it simply bathes her in light, leaving ambiguity about what new species she midwives. Subtext could sharpen if a single plant voice cracked doubt, but overall resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Akira’s sinewy attention: nostrils flare, fingers itch, spine shivers. Syntax stays lean, volcanic heat shortening clauses under pressure; no filter-verb clusters. Plants “lean” and “quiver” without pathetic-fallacy excess, maintaining otherworldly tone. One cadence hiccup: three successive “As she…” openings, but overall rhythm breathes with the beat of discovery. Diction stays within an aged insurgent’s lexicon—no academic register creep.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: a single sentence can map sulfur scent, plant whispers, and tactical scan. No mixed metaphors; geothermal logic stays coherent. Minor scaffold in “As she walked… As she worked… As she rounded…” but it never obscures cause/effect and is outside the closure third. Final line “lotus blooming in the sun” is familiar, yet justified by embryo’s golden glow and plant chorus, so only a −0.2 nick. Otherwise clean, legible, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Insurgent grandma + plant telepathy + volcanic embryo is a fresh synthesis; the kite-script decoder elevates the retrieval beyond simple scavenger hunt. Specificity—sulfur air, tattered silk tail, golden orb—prevents the mix from reading like prompt salad. The telepathy quirk could have forced a harder ethical trade (e.g., plant rebellion), but the chosen arc of insurgent turned evolutionary seed-keeper still reframes war trauma into genesis. Risk is moderate; reward is memorable.</comment>
