<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elena’s desire to preserve culture is declared, not dramatized; she never makes a costly micro-choice under pressure. The interiority is generic curator-speak (“sparkled,” “reveled”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship crucible or status shift occurs on-page; she remains a cipher observing symbols. The ending stance is asserted, not earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is present as a soft CR—Elena’s new “mantle” of guardianship—but the cost is purely rhetorical; nothing is foreclosed or paid. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ice thaw → bread reveal → memory duty; linkage is imagistic, not causal. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the beekeeper trigger is off-stage backstory, so the final reweighting feels retrofitted rather than prepared. No persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful: damp earth, luminescent fungi, emerald lens glint. The grotto’s scale and waterfall mist are sketched economically; spatial choreography stays clean. The bread sculptures function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the city never actively constrains Elena’s choices; it remains backdrop, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are announced—preserve heritage—but Elena faces no live trade-off or narrowing of options; the thaw happens to her. No reversal or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens; pressure is static awe rather than escalating cost. The “rosewater dread” is atmospheric, not tactical. Without a visible price or foreclosed path, escalation remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of cultural memory emerges through the bread-initial motif and thaw reveal, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is modest: opera glass as exile lens, bread as mnemonic archive. The ending image of guardian-duty is too cleanly resolved; ambiguity is asserted rather than felt. Resonance is gentle, not charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Elena; perceptual signature is curator-ly (“cultured,” “historically oriented mind”) without drifting into guidebook drone. Syntax is controlled, rhythm steady, no head-hopping. Diction remains within her lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Voice does not modulate under pressure because pressure is muted, keeping it short of distinction required for 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and concise; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“rosewater dread”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or lore. A few adjective clusters (“exquisite opera glass,” “delicate, bread-shaped sculptures”) flirt with prettiness but do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of thawing ice with edible family archives is fresh; the opera glass as exile relic adds texture. Yet the displaced-person frame is thematic shorthand, not dramatized through any present character’s jeopardy. Risk is modest—lyric tour rather than subversive twist—so the piece feels like an elegant vignette, not a transformed trope.</comment>
