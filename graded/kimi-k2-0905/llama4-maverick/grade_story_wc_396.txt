<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive nature is shown through her micro-choices—spotting the fragment, deciding to trust the mirrors—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts her empathic map, so the arc is flat. Still, her embodied perception of the orchard ice and crystal pulse keeps emotion physical. Earned stasis is credible: she accepts guardianship again, crystal against heart, cost felt in the slowing floes. 7.4 not 8+ because no genuine flaw complicates her; she is anomaly but not error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: images (orchard, mirrors, crystal) layer density until the final blue glow reweights empathy from abstract to tactile. Causality is soft—mirrors never explain why they hold the pattern—but the pattern is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise: the ice “sighs,” balance maintained at visible cost. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) is clear by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: crystal assembly shifts her stance from passive watcher to active balancer. Closure beat carries felt cost: “gentle pulse against her heart” + slowed floes = undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice is vivid, specific, and filters through her guardian priorities. Apple-tree roots cradling crystal, antique mirrors breathing dust—details are selective, never tourist catalog. Environment guides choice: only mirrored wall reveals fragment map; ice motion supplies final sigh. Micro-setting (crystal in cloak) constrains last beat—its pulse limits stealth. 8.6 not 9+ because ice floes never directly threaten action; they remain atmospheric monitor, not tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintain land-ice balance via empathic mapping; signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each mirror glimpse thickens pattern recognition, narrowing options until reassembly becomes inevitable single act. No external antagonist; pressure is coherent internal mandate. Cost is visible—crystal pulse now tethered to her heart, foreclosing detachment. 7.8 not 8.5 because the tightening is gentle; stakes never spike to loss-of-life urgency, only solemn duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as spatial mapping—emerges through orchard walks, fragment facets, mirror cartography; never stated. Final image (blue glow inside cloak) reweights premise: empathy is portable burden, not distant observation. Resonant ambiguity: will the ice obey her pulse tomorrow? No moralizing; theme breathes in sighing floes. 8.3 not 9.0 because thematic counter-reading is narrow; no competing moral pulls complicate her duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to peacekeeper’s perceptual signature—“shadow-laced,” “weighted breath”—syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during mirror search. No head-hop; vintage mirrors retain external strangeness. Free indirect thought clean: “Perhaps, she thought…” anchored in her calm intuition. Rhythm modulates: orchard stroll (long sentences) vs. crystal click (short clause) = pressure shift. Voice distinct without ornament overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “glint of crystal nestled in roots” shows action + setting. Mixed metaphors avoided; “shattered essence” is single coherent image. Occasional elevated diction—“reconstitute,” “conceptual repricing” risk—kept within guardian’s reflective lexicon. One paraphrase loop spotted: “whispers of the frozen sea” echoed twice; mild –0.2. Final line propels: landscape sighs, reader released. 8.1 not higher because density dips slightly during mirror montage; filter verbs (“she began to move”) could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen orchard of antique mirrors above shifting ice feels fresh synthesis of climate-fantasy + introspective lyric. Peacekeeper as empath-cartographer reverses typical warrior guardian. Crystal reassembly via reflection pattern rather than spell incantation avoids cliché. Risk isquiet, but coherence high; no shock twist, but originality lies in scaledown—world balance resting on one calm heart. 7.9 not 8.5 because premise, while elegant, is interior variation on familiar eco-guardian trope.</comment>
