<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal gazer’s interiority is almost entirely abstract—“felt an inexplicable pull,” “knew they were about to uncover”—so we never see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. No micro-choice alters the present situation; the character only observes and receives. The arc is therefore a static revelation rather than a tested stance, so the needed cost/earning is missing. What saves the score is the consistent vocation-driven motive and the single, if passive, absorption of the love-residue. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gazer exits carrying the “weight of unused love,” a felt conceptual cost. Causality, however, is weak; the film strip initiates the vision but no beats narrow options or test agency. Orientation is clear inside the booth, yet the outside world and temporal anchor remain vague. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the density increase is mostly descriptive repetition rather than tightening stakes. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly sensory—celluloid scent, dust motes, flickering frames—and every detail is filtered through the gazer’s vocation. Spatial choreography stays coherent as the letters swirl and the gazer stands, sits, exits. The vintage cinema idiom is accurate without exposition dump. What keeps it from the 9-band is that the setting never actively constrains a decision; it’s atmosphere, not pivot. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is declared early but never pressured; no option is foreclosed, no price is paid. Escalation is replaced by accumulation of letter-images, each re-stating the same ache. The sole turn is passive transport into the letter-realm; the gazer never acts to alter or claim anything. Consequently the conflict is decorative, not causal, and the cost is atmospheric rather than felt. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: love’s residue outlives forgettings, and art (film) stores it. The refrain of “forgotten lyrics searching for their tune” supplies a charged callback that reweights the opening premise. Yet the insight is asserted in the final paragraph rather than earned through a crucible choice. Subtext is thin because the gazer’s stance never crystallizes; the story tells us the love “continues to resonate” instead of dramatizing a consequence. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, clause-stacked sentences that mimic film-strip succession. Perceptual signature is strong: the gazer notices spatial relations, textures, vibrations. No dialogue appears, so no voice leakage there. The almost liturgical cadence risks monotony, but it suits the hushed-thunder tone and is clearly intentional. </comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is evocative yet loops its own metaphors—“lingering,” “resonate,” “echo” recur within adjacent sentences. Several lines do double duty, but others restate the same ache twice. No mixed metaphors, yet the sustained mournful diction edges toward purple. Copy is clean; only minor scaffold detected. The final image would survive a trim of two adjectives. </comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The “psychometric projectionist” premise is fresh, and the goodbye-letters-made-manifest device gives a memorable visual. Tropes of haunted cinema are revived through sensory specificity rather than cliché. Risk is moderate: a lyrical static vignette instead of a plotted arc. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet not aggressively original; transformation is present but modest. </comment>
