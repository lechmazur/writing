<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s “quietly deliberate” nature is stated repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma; the interiority stays abstract (“insatiable curiosity,” “wonder and awe”) and the only micro-choice is to resume work. Cost is asserted, not dramatized; she never hesitates, sacrifices, or errs, so traits remain labels rather than lived limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is loose: the heirloom key is present but never narratively tested or turned; closure depends on a metaphoric leap (“key as metaphor for cosmic order”) rather than a visible decisive change. Accumulated pattern of star-study and rune cross-reference does intensify, meeting Accumulative lens, and the dawn beat offers a light CR, so closure squeaks by with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stone observatory, floating isle, and clockwork key are sketched with economical sensory strokes; the night sky and echoing steps anchor time and mood. No object or setting feature actively constrains a choice or charges the final image, so the 9+ gate fails, but the atmosphere is coherent and selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is declared early, yet no tightening or trade-off confronts Lyra; pressure stays diffuse and abstract. Escalation is textural (nights stack up) rather than option-narrowing; the absence of a visible price keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden cosmic order emerges implicitly from repeated key / rune / shadow imagery, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit thesis (“key as metaphor…”). Subtext is thin; meaning is more asserted than reconfigured through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and lightly rhythmic; perceptual signature is generic scholar-poet rather than individuated. No dialogue to test, no head-hopping; register holds, but diction never surprises or concretizes Lyra’s unique mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and fluid, with modest variety; occasional scaffold appears (“the path to understanding lay…”). No metaphors muddle, yet information density is moderate—several sentences repeat the same beat in new wrappers. Loops are minor and do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fusing rune decryption, clockwork tech, and noon-shadow cosmology gives a fresh shimmer, but the beats are standard researcher montage without subversive twist. The premise feels like a prompt collage rather than a singular obsession; risk is present but safe.</comment>
