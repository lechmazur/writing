<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fisher’s calm, zig-zag perseverance is consistent, yet her interiority stays lyric-generic (“heart sang with excitement and reverence”) rather than concrete and contradictory under pressure. The rail spike is handled but never alters her tactics or costs her anything; it’s a prop, not a tool that forces choice. Because the goddess-echo arrives as gift rather than earned reversal, the closure feels visited upon her, not driven by visible flaw or gamble. Still, her quiet, pattern-tuned stance is individual enough to clear stereotype and earns a credible micro-endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers hum-silences and star-shifts until the final “feral lullaby” reweights the stake. Orientation is lyric-delayed but pays off at closure, so waiver applies. The missing cost is the flaw: no prior constraint or lost option charges the goddess-echo; the garden simply grants it. Closure lands as Charged Poise, but without a price-tag the beat feels light for elite bar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is evoked through motion (“whispering grasses,” “ground beneath her feet begin to vibrate”) rather than static postcard. The rail spike and constellations function as micro-setting extensions that mirror internal frequency; they constrain attention rather than space, fitting the lyric mode. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: hum > sight > touch, always filtered through the fisher’s tuning ear. Spatial choreography is intentionally dream-blurred, but bodies/props never drift or contradict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hearing the goddess-echo—is signaled early and tightens only once, when she “voices silence.” No visible cost or foreclosed option accompanies the turn; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern-break of constellations supplies the required deepening, but the absence of price keeps pressure conceptual rather than visceral. Enough for mid-high band, not 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening to the silence between patterns emerges organically through repeated hum/echo images; no character sermonizes it. The feral lullaby reprises in the final line, reweighting the garden’s hum from lull to summons, a clean CR. Complexity is modest—no counter-readings or moral friction—but the idea stays particular to this milieu. Docked fractionally for almost-tidy lyric closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is auditory-first (“gentle hum,” “whispers growing louder”). Syntax ripples in long breath-mimicking clauses that tighten into fragment at climax (“a feral lullaby that was both a call and a response”). No head-hop or register drift; diction stays within plausible fisher-poet lexicon. Rhythmic control is the strongest suit, earning high-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with purposeful variation in sentence length to mimic wave-hum. Information density dips slightly in the middle where “legend had it” exposition stalls motion for one beat. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; “patterns break themselves” repeats but is pattern-taught, hence allowed. Overall clean, but one scaffold sentence (“the act of transliterating…”) states what is already shown, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conceit of a garden whose sound-waves blur dream/reality is fresh, and the “voicing silence” method avoids clichéd oracle device. Constellation choreography and zig-zag path create a non-obvious synthesis of sky–earth–ear. Risk is moderate—lyric drift could have capsized causality—but closure stays legible. Not quite a knife-twist of new insight, hence stops shy of 9.</comment>
