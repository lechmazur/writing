<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The toll-keeper’s involuntary honesty is stated, not dramatized; no moment shows them forced to speak an inconvenient truth under pressure. The woman’s motivation is thin—she pays, states her goal, then becomes a passive observer. Their joint ascent produces no conflicting micro-choices that cost either anything, so the final “preserve wonder” line feels tagged on rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—riddle prompts inspection, log reveals adaptation—but the decisive change (repurposing the hive) is asserted off-page with no visible cost to anyone. Closure is a gentle thematic summary, not a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that reweights the tower’s future. The piece stays within single-scene default and orients early, so no structural caps apply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“Nectar dusk” and lightning-tower hum give a concise sensory frame; the beehive’s erratic drones add tactile immediacy. Setting never constrains choice—stairs, doors, tools are absent—so the tower functions as postcard backdrop rather than pressure engine. Still, selective detail keeps the world legible and tonally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are announced as “witness the failure,” but the hive poses no active danger or resource loss; tension stays intellectual. The log reveal is a static info dump, not a tightening that forecloses an option. No visible price is paid by either character, so escalation plateaus rather than crystallizes a stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of “failure preserving wonder” is stated by the toll-keeper at the end; it emerges more through dialogue than through the hive’s lived impact on either character. Subtext is minimal—no silence, gesture, or image reweights the idea. The concept is coherent but arrives as a tidy moral rather than an earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to the toll-keeper; perceptual signature is mild but consistent—honesty discomfort, machinery hum, star-watch. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm or compressed diction under pressure, keeping it competent but not singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence length and no scaffold loops. Occasional soft fillers—“with a hint of curiosity,” “mesmerized by”—reduce density without obscuring causality. Metaphors are spare and coherent; no overwriting in the climax. A few more precise verbs could lift momentum further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lightning-harvesting tower and malfunctioning drone-beehive combo feels fresh, and the candid toll-keeper is an appealing hook. The riddle-as-key is familiar, and the “failure = wonder” epiphany lands as a gentle uplift rather than a surprising reframe. Specificity of the hive log keeps it from feeling purely generic.</comment>
