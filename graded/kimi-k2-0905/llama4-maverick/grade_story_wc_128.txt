<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lena’s shrewdness is asserted but never shown pressuring a decision; the locket find is accidental, not driven by broker cunning. Interiority drifts into generic warmth (“felt a desire to initiate a gesture”) rather than concrete tactical thought. The final commitment to launch the project is told, not dramatized with visible trade-off, so the arc feels soft rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is present—locket → meeting Sophia → joint project—but the hinge moment (envelope mix-up) is revealed late and off-stage, weakening the “because/therefore” spine. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the women vow to act, cost acknowledged in “navigate the challenges ahead,” satisfying the RR test. Orientation is clear by word 60, well within the 120-word waiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sea-air library is evoked with selective sensory strokes (“musty scent of old books,” “whispers of the sea”) that mirror Lena’s nostalgic mood. The setting never constrains choice—no closing doors, dwindling light, or spatial pressure—so it ornaments rather than catalyzes. Still, the night-breezy stacks function as a micro-cradle for friendship, earning moderate density.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—emerges only at midpoint, so early tension is diffuse. Escalation is conversational, never threatening; no resource, reputation, or time cost is risked. The single tightening is the joint decision to act, but it is cushioned by mutual enthusiasm rather than tested by opposition, keeping pressure mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet compassion surfaces organically through Sophia’s locket story and the planned memorial, avoiding explicit sermon. The cycling motif (lost locket returned, letter mis-delivered correctly) frames kindness as reciprocal, but the concept stays lightweight—no ethical friction or darker counter-current complicates the warmth. Final image of sea under stars offers a gentle, non-literal answer, satisfying modest resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrative voice stays close to Lena with consistent perceptual filter (“whimsically attentive” noticing embossed letters). Syntax is polite, slightly sentimental; no rhythmic compression under emotional peaks. Dialogue is minimal and indistinct—Sophia’s speech could belong to any gentle stranger—so voice distinction rests solely on Lena’s mild coastal nostalgia.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, middle-register, with only occasional scaffold (“as they continued talking”) and no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm is steady, not propulsive; several openings repeat “As…,” creating a template cadence that dulls urgency. Information density is moderate—one job per sentence—never achieving high compression yet never clogging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of accidental locket leading to altruistic friendship is gentle, not startling; the envelope mis-delivery twist is mildly fresh but revealed retroactively, muting impact. Tropes of seaside nostalgia and starlit epiphany remain standard, merely refreshed by cargo-broker lens. Risk level is safe; no structural or moral daring pushes the piece into memorable territory.</comment>
