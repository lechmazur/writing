<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s detachment is atmospherically rendered but never crystallizes into a concrete, costly choice; the burrowing is passive, not a micro-choice that pits contradictory impulses against one another under rising pressure. Interiority circles the same abstract note (“witness without judgment”) without embodied contradiction or stakes-driven escalation. No visible flaw complicates the stance, so the final stillness feels preordained rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—keeper suspended in regenerative silence—yet the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on-page; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final cadence shift is legible but lacks a tangible forfeiture. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, but the single-scene default is stretched by repetitive, loop-like paragraphs that stall momentum. Causality is loose: origami swan hints but does not tighten options; burrowing deepens texture rather than narrowing fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library-catacomb and obsidian refuge are vividly seeded and return in the final image, giving the setting a charged micro-setting role that satisfies the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—dust, damp earth, candle flicker—filtered through the keeper’s detached gaze, reinforcing tone without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography remains stable as the keeper descends; environment subtly mirrors internal dissolution. One minor loop: “whispers of forgotten lore” / “whispers of the earth” repeats without reweighting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving impartial witness—stated early but never tested by an external pressure that would force adaptation; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. No beat narrows options or exacts a visible price; the burrowing merely deepens mood. Under Accumulative lens, a single intensifying pattern break is present (silence thickens), yet it fails to foreclose a live alternative path. Closure feels like continuation, not consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-salve emerges through recurring imagery rather than assertion, avoiding overt moralizing. Final image of keeper fused with catacomb reweights earlier decay as fragile beauty, supplying modest resonance. However, theme remains monochromatic—no counter-readings complicate the equation of silence with peace. Lacks the conceptual cost needed for higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and cadence; diction (“obsidian refuge,” “regenerative silence”) is elevated yet coherent with keeper’s scholarly remoteness. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature is stable—detail filtered through parchment-and-earth sensorium. One template cadence drift: repeated “the chronicle keeper…” openings dull rhythmic propulsion near midpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor vehicles stay internally coherent. Recurrent noun-phrase opener (“the chronicle keeper…”) creates mild syntactic monotony across paragraphs, not sentences, so template penalty is light. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; information density is high. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Detached archivist surrendering to subterranean silence is fresh enough within flash-length lyric fantasy; trope combo feels organic, not checklist. Conceptual pivot of decay as regenerative offers non-obvious angle. Risk is moderate—quiet stasis could read as static description in lesser hands, but here it is committed to fully. Lacks a startling turn that would push higher.</comment>
