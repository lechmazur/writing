<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s debt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains atmospheric rather than embodied; the alchemist’s shift from curiosity to mastery is declared, not dramatized via micro-choice. The absence of visible cost or contradiction flattens the arc to a gentle slope instead of a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: repeated “ephemeral cameo” pattern and bead-touch cadence tighten mood. Closure earns a soft Charged Poise—the greenhouse hum reweighted—yet the cost is only atmospheric; no path is foreclosed for the alchemist, only illuminated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory triage favors scent and luminescence, feeding the lyrical mode; the greenhouse’s night-bloom physiology constrains visibility and steers attention to the bead. Spatial grounding is stable, but the larger orchard layout is only sketched, keeping the setting from charging tactics beyond ambience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain tonal—unlocking flora resonance—without external jeopardy or resource limit; pressure is affective, not tactical. The single tightening is the bead-triggered glow, a beat that deepens mood more than it narrows options, satisfying the accumulative lens yet staying modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal haunting emerges implicitly through the debt-transfer: ghost’s lifelong obligation becomes alchemist’s creative inheritance. No moral is stated; the final image of smiling mournful elation lets ambiguity linger, though the insight feels gentle rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains velvet, incense-laden diction and ritual sentence rhythm; perceptual signature is collective-mystical rather than individual-sharp. No dialogue to test distinction, but narrative register remains coherent and unwavering under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional template cadence (“the alchemist felt…”) and abstract clusters (“sense of longing,” “sense of gratitude”) create mild scaffold; metaphor engine runs smooth but leans on stock Gothic perfume (“sandalwood and myrrh”). Density is good; loops are cosmetic, not causal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-as-mentor and resonant-bead MacGuffin remix familiar occult tropes, but the greenhouse-night overlay and debt-to-inheritance handoff lend a fresh shimmer. Risk is moderate; specificity keeps it from feeling prefab, yet the concept doesn’t overturn expectations.</comment>
