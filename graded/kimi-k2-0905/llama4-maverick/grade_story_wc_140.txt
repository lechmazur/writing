<comment>The survivor’s motivation—layering fragments to feel the texture of erased memories—remains an abstract wish; no concrete contradiction or micro-choice under pressure dramatizes why this matters now. Interiority loops the same paraphrase (“texture of memories,” “nameless identity”) without embodied emotion or visible cost. Because the closing stillness is not foreclosed by any prior decision that hurts, the arc feels observational rather than earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the survivor slips away, stories now internalized, tide continuing. Cost is conceptual (history reclaimed, identity stay nameless) but lacks a felt price shown on the page; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the tightening is only a cadence shift, not a knowledge or option change that stings. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, yet the ending’s emotional ledger remains oblique.</comment>

<comment>Container labyrinth is vividly sketched—rusted canyons, faded labels, tide-echo—selective sensory detail mirrors survivor’s narrowed attention. The poison-bottle label and tide rhythm recur to charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the setting’s scale subtly guides the footstep rhythm. No constraint or prop alters tactics, so the 9+ gate is not met.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased histories via story-fragments—is declared early but never narrowed; no beat risks failure, stamina, or social cost. Pressure is atmospheric (tide echo, towering stacks) rather than an option-closing tightening; the lens allows accumulative deepening, yet the page never shows a fragment that can’t be gathered or a memory that resists layering. Escalation is mood gradient only.</comment>
