<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is sensuously embodied (“bare feet curled,” “breathing slow”) and her cosmic-art motive is consistent, but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; the exile backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, so the “cosmic verse” quest feels pre-ordained, not wrestled with. The moonstone anchoring is the only micro-choice, yet it is passive (hand “drawn”) and carries no visible trade-off. No flaw or misbelief complicates her dance; she ends where she began, untested and unchanged beyond having a tattoo-equivalent. Earned cost is therefore thin; the closure is scenic, not characterological.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is signaled early (pattern of “gaps” and star-garden texture) and held; closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing verse on skin crystallizes meaning and forecloses her exile. Orientation anchors inside 120 words, transition-free; moonstone re-appears at climax to reweight stakes. Causality is loose (anchoring is magical coincidence), but under lyric design that is acceptable; still, the final cost is felt more as image than consequence, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The twilight garden is rendered through selective sensory triangulation—night-flower scent, stone temperature, starlight gaps—each filtered through dancer perception and braided into movement. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Aria circles the stone; moonstone operates as micro-setting that constrains the final pirouette. Weather and world-rules stay implicit but consistent. While the city exile remains a floating off-stage contrast, the immediate environment charges both stakes and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—capture cosmic verse on skin—is signaled early; tension accumulates via repetition of “gaps” and star-whispers rather than causal reversals. Mid-text deepening occurs when moonstone glow intensifies, narrowing her dance to stillness; this is the meaningful intensification required for lyric mode. Price is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed and no resource lost, so escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—art as cosmic inscription—emerges imagistically: night flowers, star gaps, and skin verse form a returning pattern that reframes exile as portal rather than punishment. Subtext stays implicit; no moral is stated. Nostalgia-ban concept is named but not woven into stakes, so thematic complexity is mid-band. Final image of fading speck-light offers resonant reconfiguration, yet ambiguity is gentle rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited hovers at dancer-distance; perceptual signature privileges kinesthetic synesthesia (“lapping ocean against the shore created a soothing melody”) and stellar scale. Syntax grows leaner under peak dance, mirroring breath. No dialogue, hence no register risk; free-indirect texture stays consistent. Occasional poetic loft (“obsidian grace,” “canvas of stars”) skirts purple but remains within Aria’s artistic lexicon and is pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from languid opening cadences to clipped final fragments (“She departed…”), propelling the dance arc. Metaphors are coherent (stars as canvas, verse as skin) and avoid cross-threaded vehicles. Filter-verb clusters absent; information density high—one sentence often layers scent, sound, and motion. Minor paraphrase echo (“she stood there… she stood there”) is the only loop, not touching closure, so penalty is small.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusing cosmic tattoo trope with tide-dancer exile is fresh; moonstone dust speck as micro-muse is delicate and specific. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off in final image. However, nostalgia-ban backdrop remains ornamental, and “cosmic verse on mortal skin” flirts with fashionable mystic-art motif without subverting it, limiting full freshness.</comment>
