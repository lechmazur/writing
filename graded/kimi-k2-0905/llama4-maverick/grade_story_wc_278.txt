<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tattooist’s interior contradiction—guilt for an unnamed past choice vs. the need to quiet it through baby-cry translation—is concrete and embodied (she fingers the amber, knots the cord). Micro-choices under pressure are visible: she reaches for the cord when reality thins, and that act steadies her. The final renunciation of guilt is earned by the causality of reading the letters and confronting the firmware whispers. Cost is legible: she forecloses the haunted loop and accepts the meteor hush, leaving the needles still but creativity alive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of sound → silence, firmware whispers → meteor hush, guilt → release. Closure is a Charged Poise: the meteor hush crystallizes options—she stays in the quiet, needles down, guilt stilled. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the laboratory of lost sounds…”). No causal reversals are required under this lens; the deepening of texture reweights the stake. Cost is the acceptance of an open-ended quiet that forecloses the old haunted cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Laboratory, antique dresser, amber, cord, and meteor hush all constrain choice or charge the final image. The dresser delivers the letters that tilt her stance; the cord literally tethers her to present time; the amber’s insect stirs as reality thins. Sensory economy is strong—sandalwood, myrrh, flicker of candles—filtered through her professional eye for carved stories. Spatial choreography is clean: dresser corner, whirring machinery, wrist-wrapped cord all track.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quieting old guilt—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens when letters force confrontation. One meaningful deepening: the firmware whispers intensify until she ties the cord, narrowing her options to “face or be consumed.” Cost is the surrender of the haunted sound-world for the unknown meteor hush. Agency is endurance/renunciation rather than external victory, consistent with accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: sound vs. silence, haunted vs. hush, guilt vs. infant coo. No explicit thesis; final image of baby-cry-as-new-beginning reweights prior material. Subtext lives in the amber—fossilized past watching—and in the cord as self-imposed limit. Moral ambiguity intact: she heals herself but the clients merely “report peace,” leaving ethical cost of absorbing others’ dissonance unresolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic-sound: “echoes of forgotten melodies,” “gentle susurrus that seemed to carry the weight of the stars.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for reflection, staccato bursts for firmware whispers. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Diction stays within tattooist’s poetic but grounded lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud ear: sentence length varies, paragraph cuts tight. No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors are few but precise—“shadows… writhing like living things.” One mixed strain: “meteor hush” is coined and abstract, yet the final line pays it off by tying it to baby coo. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tattooing, haunted firmware, baby-cry translation, and meteor hush feels fresh and specific to this voice. The amber-with-insect as soul-lens and the cord as temporal anchor are non-obvious syntheses. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot—heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Premise transformed through sensory particulars; removal would collapse the entire atmospheric engine.</comment>
