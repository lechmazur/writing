<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dresser’s devotion is palpable, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wisely pragmatic” vs. nostalgic ritual) rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice; the polishing ritual never risks failure or tangible trade-off, so the final smile feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the garden “knows” the dresser—yet the cost is only atmospheric; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds, but the decisive reconfiguration is asserted, not paid for on the page, keeping it below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hedge maze, cracked marbles, and pruning shears are vividly filtered through the dresser’s tactile labor; the garden’s scent and twilight shadows constrain the final pause, though spatial choreography of the maze itself remains vaguely gestural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the garden reciprocates care—never tightens; no beat risks measurable luck dropping or a graft failing, so pressure stays ambient rather than option-narrowing; the midpoint “first bloom” celebration merely repeats the opening condition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent reciprocity emerges through iterated polishing of broken marbles, but the final “mended deception” is named rather than reweighted; resonance is gentle, not conceptually repriced, leaving the insight slightly pat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to the dresser’s gnarled hands and marble-lit memory; syntax lengthens and softens with dusk, creating a consistent elegiac cadence free of filter clutter or head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly purposeful; however, strings of near-synonyms (“a testament… a reflection… a tribute…”) create paraphrase loops that dull the final third, and “withering beauty” is used twice within four lines, blunting the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Quantified-luck world and marble-polishing ritual fuse into a fresh pastoral SF texture; the concept feels specific to this voice, though the maze setting stays generic enough that the idea could transplant without structural rupture.</comment>
