<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “helix-minded” label is never dramatized—no visible contradiction, tool-use, or failure that would let us feel the trait. Her motivation is declared (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) but never tested by a competing want; the only micro-choice is to keep reassembling mirror fragments, which never risks anything tangible. Interiority drifts into theme-speak (“she knew she was…”) instead of embodied perception. Internal conflict is absent; nothing she does threatens her self-concept or forecloses an alternative path, so the ending stasis feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is “mirror broken → mirror fixed → memories pour in”; escalation is purely additive (more fragments re-assembled, more memories seen) rather than option-narrowing. Closure is a soft “she knew she was ready,” a summary assertion without visible cost or decisive change. No constraint or price is left on the page; she could walk away unchanged. Orientation is clear early; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern never tightens—just accumulates description.</comment>

<comment>Canyon and moonlight are sensuously tracked across the beats; the mirror shard literally refracts the moonlight onto Elara’s hands, charging the final image. Weather and terrain remain static backdrop rather than active constraint—no rockslide, no temperature drop that forces tactics. Micro-setting (the cracked glass as lens) is viscerally handled and ties directly to the closing gleam, satisfying the 9+ gate for “object that charges final image.” Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Stake is abstract: “unlock secrets of abandoned dreams.” The only pressure is the lure of more memories; no resource dwindles, no external risk materializes. The single meaningful turn—mirror suddenly reflects entangled memories—happens to her; she does not narrow options or pay a price. Escalation is therefore decorative rather than tactical; the lens is Accumulative but lacks a tightening that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “abandoned dreams reclaimed” is emergent, never sloganized, carried by the mirror’s recovered shine. The motif avoids overt allegory; meaning accrues through the repeating image of cracked glass becoming whole. Final image reweights earlier motif (mirror gleam) but without conceptual cost—the dreams remain other people’s, not Elara’s, so the reconfiguration is mild. Subtext stays implicit; no character articulates a thesis, dodging the thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Diction is elevated but consistent (“helix-minded,” “synaptic plasticity”) and justified by her engineer identity. Rhythm is lull-lyric, matching moonlit reverie; no template cadence. Perceptual signature is present—she sees “silvery molecule-quivering air”—but drifts toward poetic generics under pressure rather than sharpening. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluent, occasionally gorgeous, but leans on abstract intensifiers (“inexplicable connection,” “otherworldly energy”) that blunt specificity. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (“memories… entangled… recollections… web of recollections”) creating micro-loops. Mixed metaphors (“helix-minded,” “synaptic plasticity”) are decorative, never grounded in tool-use or bodily consequence. No artifact touches closure, but the sustained loftiness flattens tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—“engineer re-enacts archaeologist of dreams via cracked mirror”—offers a fresh blend of hard-tech and lyric mysticism. Execution keeps the concept abstract, not tactical, so the ingenuity feels conceptual rather than dramatized. Mirror-as-memory-catalyst is familiar, but canyon-moon optics give it a sensory twist. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure instead of causal plot; coherence holds but does not deepen.</comment>
