<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the spinner’s contradictory stillness-vs-motion impulse is embodied in the loom/puzzle parallel. Motivation is legible—silence must be re-spun into connection—yet the “latent sacrifice” is gestured at, not dramatized with visible forfeit. Micro-choices are present (threading, fitting puzzle pieces) but do not tighten under rising external pressure; cost is poetic, not material. Voice remains singular; no relationship crucible on page, so status tests are N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of loom + puzzle fragments accreting meaning until the final “bridge” image reweights stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—threads become bridge, silence becomes conduit—cost is conceptual but legible in the glow of the amber bead. Orientation clear by ~70 words; no transitions or shard breaks, stays within single-scene default. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore; acceptable under Accumulative mode and holds to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bamboo orchard is filtered through spinner’s wistful attention—rustle = loom click, amber bead = memory capsule—serving accumulative texture. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Sensory economy favors scent and filtered light, matching melancholic tone. Setting does not physically constrain tactics; orchard stays backdrop, so gate for 9+ not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: re-spin silence into connection; signaled early. Pressure is lyrical accumulation—each fitted puzzle piece and woven thread thickens the emotional weave—rather than external opposition. No visible price (time, money, bodily risk) is dramatized; cost remains metaphorical. One meaningful deepening at sunset when loom pattern completes; suffices for 600-word accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection-through-assembly emerges through loom/puzzle doubling; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in amber pulse and thread-bridge, final reweighting of silence as material. Ambiguity is preserved—sacrifice hinted, not resolved—inviting reflection beyond page. Avoids sermon; ends on image, not moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains spindle-spark diction and rhythmic repetition (“Through the hush…”) that mirrors loom cadence; no filter-verb clutter. Compression taught early (“wistful loom spinner…stoically sparkling thread”) and paid off in final bead-glow. No dialogue, so voice is judged on narrative texture alone; remains coherent and distinct under pressure. Sentence variety is rich; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is strong; figurative language is patterned (thread/puzzle/silence) rather than gratuitous. One mixed-metor risk: “raveling silence” vs “unraveling tapestry” flirts with contradiction but resolves as intentional paradox. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Occasional elevated adjectives (“susurrus”) fit lyrical register and are earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Loom-spinner repairing relationship via jigsaw is fresh synthesis of domestic crafts as emotional tech. Orchard-as-threshold and bead-as-memory avoid generic fantasy trinkets. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but coherence is high. Could swap bamboo for pine without structural change, limiting top-band entry.</comment>
