<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Akira’s “phototropic” trait is label-speak until the lantern glass gives it one embodied moment; the interiority never fractures under pressure, so the promised zen contradiction stays abstract. The final “sharp gentleness” is performed, not dramatized—she simply packs up, so the renunciation carries no palpable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oasis stays dead yet “resists change” via residual kindness, a pleasing inversion that carries conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thrumming, honey scent, smoke—but the causality between sun-pattern etchings and timeline “alignment” is asserted, not demonstrated, blunting the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The oasis is sketched with economical, multi-sensory strokes—cracked earth, old-wax perfume, flattening smoke—each filtering through Akira’s potter-eye for texture. The lantern glass earns micro-setting status: handled twice, its curved light guides the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are abstract—“why places resist change”—so pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the only narrowing is the smoke’s flattening, which reweights the premise conceptually rather than constricting real options. No visible price is paid; Akira leaves intact, so escalation is mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: kindness as a residual, phototropic force that outlives industry. The lantern glass’s return in the final line reprices the motif without overt moralizing, giving quiet resonance; the concept stays complex because the oasis remains ruined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Akira’s perceptual bias—clay-maker’s attention to curve and fracture—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates with scene temperature, and diction stays within her plausible lexicon; occasional poetic uplift (“sun patterns etched into the glass”) is justified by her contemplative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is mostly varied, but clusters of participial openers (“baking… withering… catching…”) create template cadence; metaphors stay coherent, yet some sentences lean on ornamental pairing (“sharp gentleness,” “fragile balance”) that stall propulsion. No loops obscure causality, but the final beat is slightly padded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The beekeeping wasteland plus zen potter is a fresh synthesis; the “phototropic kindness” angle offers a non-obvious physics-of-care twist. Risk remains modest—no structural invention—so the lift is moderate; the concept feels particular to this voice, not a stitched prompt response.</comment>
