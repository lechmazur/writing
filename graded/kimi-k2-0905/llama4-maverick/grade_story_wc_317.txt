<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The proprietor’s interiority is vividly rendered through her tactile handling of the seed and her iterative theorizing, but the “orthogonal approaches” remain abstract schema rather than dramatized micro-choices. Her motivation—to safeguard creative space—stays thematic; no moment shows her refusing a safer commercial option or paying a concrete cost for innovation. The emotional arc is a smooth ascent from curiosity to anticipation, lacking a contradictory impulse that would complicate her stance. Consequently, the closure feels like a tidy creative ignition rather than an earned renunciation or charged poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reverie layer deepens the seed’s symbolic density until it catalyzes the new-room concept. Orientation is swift—who/where/when locked by line 3—and the single scene stays contiguous. The meaningful tightening is the dawn realization that reconfigures her professional path; the cost is opportunity/energy spent overnight, felt but not foregrounded. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the absence of a visible constraint or forfeiture keeps it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook haven is sketched with selective sensory strokes—moon-dappled floor, water over stones—and these details mirror her shifting attention rather than stall momentum. The seed as micro-setting absorbs light and later absorbs her imagination, constraining her focus and ultimately charging the final desk image. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean; no impossible moves. Environment stays subordinate to interiority, yet its atmospheric pressure sustains the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early: will the seed yield a viable creative challenge? Pressure escalates not through external opposition but via densifying associative thought—each theory thickens the seed’s symbolic cost. The protagonist’s agency is intellectual pacing and dawn outlining; the narrowing is the foreclosing of a blank-canvas night into a single themed room concept. Cost is present—sleep, uncertainty—but lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push the tension into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of creativity-as-mystery emerges organically from the seed’s irreducible strangeness; no explicit thesis states “innovation is good.” The final image of the seed beside exhausted pen reweights it from ominous gift to muse, achieving quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains—sender unknown, risk unmeasured—inviting reflection without moralizing. Subtext operates through tactile detail rather than symbolic slogans, satisfying the 9-band’s demand for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the proprietor’s perceptual filters: “felt an inexplicable connection,” “mind began to flow.” Diction tilts slightly literary—“dappled shadows,” “storm-born silence”—yet remains consistent with a puzzle-designer’s lyrical bent. Rhythm lengthens during reverie, then shortens at dawn switch, mirroring cognitive surge. No dialogue to distort voice; free indirect thought is clean and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with varied sentence openings and natural paragraph cuts. Figurative language (“seed seemed to absorb light”) is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. A few minor loops—“flow of ideas and creativity guiding her”—but these occur in low-pressure summary, not at closure. Information density is high; each sentence advances interiority or atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise flips the cursed-object trope into a creative catalyst; the corpse-flower seed is specific, not interchangeable. Accumulative structure mirrors puzzle-design cognition, a fresh angle on inventor stories. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric escalation rather than plot twist—but coherence justifies the choice. Freshness resides in process, not world-rules; hence reaches high 7s rather than 9+.</comment>
